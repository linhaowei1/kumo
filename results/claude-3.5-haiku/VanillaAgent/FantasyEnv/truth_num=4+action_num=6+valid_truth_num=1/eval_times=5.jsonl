However, we still need to definitively confirm its identity.\n\nGiven our remaining options, I think the \"Evaluate Heat Signature\" test would be a good next step. The Sword of Justice is described as having a \"magical simplicity\", so its heat signature might help us further characterize it.\n\nThe guidebook suggests this test can help us understand the heat energy emanating from the artifact. By checking its heat signature, we might gain more insight into its properties and potentially narrow down our identification.\n\nThe strategic reasoning is:\n1. We want to gather more distinguishing characteristics\n2. Heat signature can help differentiate between artifact types\n3. We have limited remaining artifacts to test\n4. This test provides clear, quantifiable results\n\nTherefore, I will select the Evaluate Heat Signature test to continue our investigation.\n\n<ANSWER>Evaluate Heat Signature</ANSWER>", "Let's analyze the heat signature result of 10.234, which is quite low on the scale.\n\nReviewing the guidebook, a heat signature in the range of (0, 30) would rule out the Sword of Flames. This aligns with our current understanding of the Sword of Justice being a weapon with \"magical simplicity\" and a low heat output.\n\nTo further narrow down our investigation, I'll choose the \"Analyze Energy Emissions\" test. This will help us understand the intensity of magical energy being radiated by the artifact.\n\nAccording to the guidebook, energy emissions in the range of (50, 100) would exclude the Gloves of Thievery. Given the low heat signature we just observed, this test could provide additional discriminating information about our artifact.\n\nThe strategic reasoning is:\n1. We want to continue gathering distinguishing characteristics\n2. Energy emissions can help further differentiate between artifacts\n3.

However, to be thorough and conclusive, I'll choose the Analyze Sonic Resonance test.\n\nAccording to the guidebook, a high resonance would rule out the Sword of Justice, Gem of Seeing, Sword of Flames, and Gloves of Thievery. Therefore, if we get a low resonance result, it would further confirm our hypothesis about the Sword of Justice.\n\nThe strategic reasoning is:\n1. We want to gather final confirming evidence\n2. Sonic resonance can provide a distinctive characteristic\n3. We have strong indications this is the Sword of Justice\n4.
