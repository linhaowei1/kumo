To differentiate, **Tenderness Measurement** is critical: Poaching typically yields higher tenderness due to gentler heat, while Boiling may result in variable tenderness depending on cooking time. A low tenderness score (0-3) would rule out Poaching, leaving Boiling as the answer. A high score (7-10) would confirm Poaching.
