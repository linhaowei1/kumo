This test provides a quick way to narrow down the candidates. If the outcome is strong fluorescence, no exclusions occur, but this is less likely given the gemstone options. Choosing this test first offers a clear path to eliminating at least one candidate early, making subsequent tests more efficient.\n\n<ANSWER> UV Fluorescence Check </ANSWER>", "\n\nThe UV Fluorescence Check resulted in **Weak Fluorescence**, which excludes **Morganite**.
