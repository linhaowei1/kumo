The **Research Project** directly assesses **Research Skills**. If the student's project outcome is \"Insufficient,\" Research Skills are lacking. If the outcome is \"Thorough and Insightful\" or \"Adequate,\" Research Skills are confirmed, narrowing the list further. This test provides a clear yes/no answer for a specific ability, minimizing steps.\n\n<ANSWER> Research Project </ANSWER>", "To efficiently narrow down the remaining abilities, the **Listening Comprehension Test** is a strategic choice. If the student scores 0-59, **Listening Skills** are immediately ruled out as present, identifying it as the lacked ability. If they score higher, Listening Skills are confirmed, allowing elimination of that ability from consideration. This test provides a clear binary outcome for a single ability, optimizing step efficiency.\n\n<ANSWER> Listening Comprehension Test </ANSWER>", "To efficiently narrow down the remaining abilities, the **Analytical Reasoning Test** is a strategic choice. A high score (90-100) confirms both **Analytical Skills** and **Logical Reasoning**, while a moderate score (70-89) confirms only Analytical Skills. A low score (0-69) eliminates neither. This test provides clarity on two critical abilities in one step, accelerating the elimination process. \n\n<ANSWER> Analytical Reasoning Test </ANSWER>", "To efficiently narrow down the remaining abilities, the **Physical Coordination Test** is a strategic choice. A score of 70-89 or 90-100 confirms **Physical Coordination**, eliminating it as a candidate. A score of 0-69 would directly identify Physical Coordination as the lacked ability.
