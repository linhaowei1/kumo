Conversely, a third-person perspective would keep both arcs possible, requiring further analysis. However, since **Realistic Fiction** has already been confirmed as the genre (via Genre Classification), and the remaining arc options are thematic (Loss of Innocence) or genre-aligned (Realistic Fiction), the narrative arc is most logically **Realistic Fiction**, as the genre and arc align in this context. \n\n<ANSWER> Realistic Fiction </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 11248, "observations": [null, {"action": "Genre Classification", "observation": "Realistic Fiction"}, {"action": "Motif Recognition", "observation": "No Recurring Motifs"}], "successful": true, "parse_error": false}, {"actions": ["Genre Classification", "Motif Recognition", "Realistic Fiction", {"predicted_truth": "Realistic Fiction"}], "generated_text": ["\n\n<ANSWER> Genre Classification </ANSWER>", "\n\nAfter using **Genre Classification**, which ruled out \"Myth,\" the remaining arcs are **Loss of Innocence**, **Realistic Fiction**, and **Symbolism**.
