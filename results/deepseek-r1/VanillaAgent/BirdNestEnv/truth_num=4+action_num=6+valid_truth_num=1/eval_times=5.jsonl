However:\n\n- **Eagle Nest** aligns with the observed height (86.3 meters, far exceeding 1 meter, which does not trigger the exclusion rule) and thermal imaging (38.59\u00b0C, warmer than the exclusion threshold). \n- **Parrot Nest** is inconsistent with the extreme height (parrots typically nest in tree cavities or lower branches, not at 86 meters) and lacks supporting evidence like squawking calls or specific materials (spider silk).\n\nThe contradiction between the nest materials (twigs/grasses vs. Eagle\u2019s typical mud/saliva) is overridden by the guidebook\u2019s rules, which only exclude Eagle if mud/saliva are found.
