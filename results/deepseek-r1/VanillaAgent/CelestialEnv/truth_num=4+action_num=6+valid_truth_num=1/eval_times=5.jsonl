To narrow down, **Pulsar Timing** is chosen next. If timing variations are detected, Lunar Eclipse is ruled out; if stable, Gravitational Wave Event is eliminated. This step efficiently reduces the possibilities by targeting two events at once. \n\n<ANSWER> Pulsar Timing </ANSWER>", "\n\nAfter using **Pulsar Timing** and detecting timing variations, **Lunar Eclipse** was ruled out. The remaining events are **Variable Star Luminosity Change**, **Gravitational Wave Event**, and **Fast Radio Burst**. To efficiently narrow down further, **Spectral Analysis** is chosen next. If emission lines are present, **Gravitational Wave Event** is ruled out (as gravitational waves do not produce electromagnetic emission lines). If absorption or a continuous spectrum is observed, **Variable Star** or **Fast Radio Burst** remain candidates. This step directly targets one of the three remaining events, making it a strategic choice to reduce possibilities.\n\n<ANSWER> Spectral Analysis </ANSWER>", "\n\nAfter **Spectral Analysis** revealed emission lines, **Gravitational Wave Event** was ruled out. The remaining possibilities are **Variable Star Luminosity Change** and **Fast Radio Burst**. To distinguish between them, **Photometry** is the optimal next step. If the brightness level falls in the 5-10 range, **Variable Star Luminosity Change** is ruled out, leaving **Fast Radio Burst** as the answer. If the brightness is outside this range, **Variable Star** remains a candidate. This approach directly targets the remaining ambiguity with minimal steps.\n\n<ANSWER> Photometry </ANSWER>", "\n\nAfter **Photometry** showed a brightness level of ~24.67 (falling in the 10-30 range), no events are ruled out. The remaining candidates are **Variable Star Luminosity Change** and **Fast Radio Burst**. To differentiate between them, **Stellar Seismology** is the most strategic choice. If oscillation frequencies in the 1-10 range are detected, **Variable Star** is ruled out, leaving **Fast Radio Burst** as the answer. If frequencies are in 0-1, **Variable Star** remains possible. This step directly targets the remaining ambiguity with minimal additional observations.\n\n<ANSWER> Stellar Seismology </ANSWER>", "\n\nAfter applying **Stellar Seismology** and observing an oscillation frequency of ~2.39 (within the 1-10 range), **Variable Star Luminosity Change** is ruled out.
