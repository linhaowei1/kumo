For example:\n- A complexity score of **8–12** would eliminate Folk, Country, Reggae, and Pop.\n- A score of **4–7** would eliminate New Age.\n- A score of **0–3** would eliminate Progressive Rock.\n- A score of **13–24** would eliminate Hip Hop.  \n\nThis test efficiently splits the remaining genres into groups with significant eliminations, making it a strong next step. \n\n<ANSWER> Analyze Harmonic Complexity </ANSWER>", "\n\nThe observed harmonic complexity score of **2.016** falls into the **0–3 complexity** range, which eliminates **Progressive Rock**.
