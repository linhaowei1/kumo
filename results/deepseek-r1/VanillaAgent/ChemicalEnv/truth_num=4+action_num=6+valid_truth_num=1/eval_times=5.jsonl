However, **Formaldehyde** (an aldehyde) would react vigorously with Grignard reagents due to its carbonyl group, producing a clear reaction (e.g., gas evolution or visible precipitate). A **mild reaction** strongly points to **Isopropanol**, as alcohols like isopropanol do not react significantly with Grignard reagents under standard conditions, aside from quenching them without vigorous effects. No further experiments are needed to confirm this conclusion.  \n\n<ANSWER> Isopropanol </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 30472, "observations": [null, {"action": "Reaction with dilute base", "observation": "salt_formation"}, {"action": "pH test", "observation": 8.080448233960173}, {"action": "Reaction with Grignard reagent", "observation": "mild_reaction"}], "successful": false, "parse_error": false}, {"actions": ["Flash point measurement", null], "generated_text": ["<ANSWER> Flash point measurement </ANSWER>", null], "consumed_tokens": 11896, "observations": [null, {"action": "Flash point measurement", "observation": 123.3744889835985}], "successful": false, "parse_error": true}, {"actions": [null], "generated_text": [null], "consumed_tokens": 0, "observations": [null], "successful": false, "parse_error": true}, {"actions": [null], "generated_text": [null], "consumed_tokens": 0, "observations": [null], "successful": false, "parse_error": true}, {"actions": [null], "generated_text": [null], "consumed_tokens": 0, "observations": [null], "successful": false, "parse_error": true}], "seed": 49, "average_actions": 2.0, "average_tokens": 8473.6, "average_correct": 0.0, "average_parse_error": 0.8, "average_successful_action_num": 0, "average_successful_tokens": 0}
