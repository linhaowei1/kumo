Since **Pigment Analysis** did not rule out either, the next decisive step is **Provenance Documentation Review**. If no provenance records are found, Damien Hirst would be excluded (per the guidebook), leaving Mark di Suvero as the sculptor.

While **Isotope Ratio Analysis** could differentiate them (strontium excludes Mark), the absence of synthetic fibers (earlier Microscopic Fiber Analysis) and documented provenance (uncommon for Damien) suggest **Mark di Suvero** aligns better with the observed outcomes: industrial steel sculptures often incorporate natural elements (e.g., wood bases) and mineral pigments, consistent with the findings.
