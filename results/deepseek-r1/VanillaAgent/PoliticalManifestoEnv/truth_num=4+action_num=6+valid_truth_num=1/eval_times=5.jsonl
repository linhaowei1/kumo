This excludes **Egalitarianism** (which emphasizes universal equality) and aligns more closely with ideologies favoring selective rights based on identity. **Fascism** and **Ethnocentrism** both prioritize certain groups (national or ethnic), but **Pacifism** focuses on nonviolence and universal peace, making it less likely to align with selective rights. \n\nTo distinguish between **Fascism** and **Ethnocentrism**, **Media Freedom Analysis** is critical.
