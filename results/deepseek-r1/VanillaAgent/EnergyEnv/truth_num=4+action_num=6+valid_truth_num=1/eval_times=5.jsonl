The Radiation Level Measurement of 0.4875 ruled out **Molten Salt Reactors**, leaving Offshore Wind Power, Coal Power, and Biomass Energy. To narrow further, the **Steam Quality Test** is critical. If steam purity is low, it rules out both Coal and Biomass, leaving Offshore Wind Power as the only plausible source. If steam purity is high or absent, other tests would be needed, but this test offers the most decisive elimination potential. \n\n<ANSWER> Steam Quality Test </ANSWER>", "\n\nAfter performing the Steam Quality Test and observing \"No Steam Detected,\" which doesn't rule out any sources, the remaining candidates are **Offshore Wind Power**, **Coal Power**, and **Biomass Energy**.

If it\u2019s high (51\u2013100), Biomass remains a candidate.

To distinguish between them, **Surface Temperature Mapping** is critical. If the temperature is \u226531\u00b0C, Coal Power is ruled out (per the guidebook), leaving Offshore Wind as the only option. If it\u2019s \u226430\u00b0C, Coal remains possible, requiring a follow-up test like Acoustic Vibration Analysis. Surface Temperature Mapping provides a decisive next step.\n\n<ANSWER> Surface Temperature Mapping </ANSWER>", "\n\nThe remaining candidates are **Offshore Wind Power** and **Coal Power**. The **Surface Temperature Mapping** result (16.38\u00b0C) did not rule out Coal Power, as only temperatures \u226531\u00b0C would eliminate it. To distinguish between the two, **Acoustic Vibration Analysis** is critical. Offshore Wind Power typically generates low-frequency vibrations from turbine rotation.
