The \"Assess Magical Stability\" test is suitable because if it returns a result in the range of 0 to 50, it will exclude the *Cloak of Mists*, giving us a clearer path towards identifying the artifact.

According to the guidelines, this result falls into the range of 50 to 100, which means we can exclude the *Ring of Invisibility*. However, we had already ruled that option out in previous tests, so this test does not impact our current selections.\n\nCurrently, we have two remaining artifacts: the *Cape of Flight* and the *Gauntlets of Strength*. To distinguish between these two options, we can now utilize the \"Test for Necromantic Essence\".

The \"Detect Magical Aura\" test can be useful here, as it does not exclude any of the remaining artifacts at outcomes lower than 75, but does exclude both the *Ring of Invisibility* and *Cloak of Mists* at higher outcomes.
