If there isn't a copyleft clause, 'Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)' and 'Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)', which both impose copyleft obligations, can be ruled out.", "<ANSWER> Attribution Requirement Check </ANSWER>\n\nReason: Since the `Copyleft Clause Examination` outcome indicated no copyleft clauses, we can now focus on the `Attribution Requirement Check`. This will help us eliminate licenses that require attribution. Specifically, 'Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)' and 'Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)' both require attribution. Running this check will definitively exclude these two licenses.", "<ANSWER> Anti-DRM Clause Identification </ANSWER>\n\nReason: The `Attribution Requirement Check` outcome indicates that the current preference `Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)` requires attribution, which aligns with all our available options. Since no other licenses in the available list require attribution (CC BY-SA and CC BY-NC-SA do), we need to focus on other criteria that might help in ruling out `Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)`. The `Anti-DRM Clause Identification` method is relevant here as it can potentially rule out `Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)` given its lack of an anti-DRM clause.\n\nAt this point, since `Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)` has been ruled out due to its specific attribute on commercial use and completeness of attribution, we can now infer that the remaining options are:\n- `CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)`\n- `Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)`\n- `Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)`\n\nGiven that all three remain, we need to further assess our initial assumptions or use another analysis method. Since `Anti-DRM Clause Identification` evaluates whether a license includes anti-DRM clauses and here `MS-PL` does not have such a clause, this confirms our preference.
