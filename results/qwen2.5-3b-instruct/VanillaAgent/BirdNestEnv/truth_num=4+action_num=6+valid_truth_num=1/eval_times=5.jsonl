However, since the Parrot Nest typically uses feathers and spider silk for nesting material and often involves intricate designs that could be detected in fragments or materials remaining around the nest, and Bowerbirds use decorations in their nests to indicate potential mates (even if not always visible within the nest itself), let's see if we can gather more definitive information to eliminate these while also keeping an open mind.\n\nWe can move on to either examining the nest material or using the presence of decorations as our next step.\n\n<ANSWER> ${Presence of Decorations} </ANSWER>", "Given the observation that decorations are present, we can rule out the Bowerbird Nest.

Since the stork nest is known for being significantly larger and more substantial, and eagles typically have nests warmer due to the materials they use (mud and saliva), we can infer that the nest is likely an eagle nest or a stork nest.
