It could feature classical column orders and religious motifs.\n- **Gothic Architecture**: Gothic architecture typically features pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses. It's known for its slender columns and often considered symmetrical with vertical emphasis.\n- **Organic Architecture**: This style champions harmonious integration with nature, often using fluid forms and rectilinear planes with organic, flowing curves.\n- **Modernist Architecture**: Modernist buildings tend to have clean lines, rectangular forms and are designed for function and efficiency. They may use steel and glass and feature minimal ornamentation.\n\nGiven the lack of specific outcomes and a need to rule out options based on historical characteristics, let's assess the comparisons:\n\n1. **Inspect Architectural Motifs**: Both Byzantine and Gothic architecture generally include religious symbolism and themes. However, Gothic architecture is specifically known for vertical rhythms and golden ratio proportions, which can be distinct from Byzantine's religious iconography.\n2. **Review Use of Geometric Forms**: Modernist architecture emphasizes rectilinear forms, while Gothic and Byzantine styles tend to be more symmetrical and often feature classical orders with rectilinear elements. However, Orthodox churches in Byzantine style can also feature flying buttresses as a structural element.\n3. **Examine Sustainability Features**: Sustainability was not a primary focus in these architectural movements, so this comparison is less likely to be useful for this initial analysis.\n4. **Calculate Floor Area**: Given that the historic use of floor area correlates with historical period, and considering Gothic structures were designed to be large and enduring, this could help disqualify Gothic in favor of a more modern or Industrial age style.\n5. **Measure Proportions and Symmetry**: Gothic architecture is known for a keen focus on symmetry and proportions.
