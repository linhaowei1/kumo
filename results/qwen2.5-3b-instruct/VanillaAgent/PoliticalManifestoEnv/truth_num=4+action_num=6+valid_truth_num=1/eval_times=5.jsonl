The key outcomes are:\n\n- Secular Policies: Does not exclude any political ideologies.\n- Religious Influence in Governance: Excludes secularism.\n- Moderate Religious Influence: No specific exclusions provided.\n\nSince secularism is already eliminated, the outcomes do not provide any new exclusions.\n\n### Step 8: Criminal Justice Policy Analysis\nCriminal Justice Policy Analysis examines approaches to law enforcement and justice systems.
