Since Wakame thrives in nutrient-rich environments and Tilapia prefer low biofouling, a phytoplankton bloom would likely affect Wakame but not necessarily Tilapia in a direct manner.\n\n2. **Parasite Load Measurement** - This affects Rainbow Trout. If there is a high parasite load, Rainbow Trout should be excluded because they have a high parasite load tolerance.\n\n3. **Currents and Tidal Flow Studies** - This affects Sargassum muticum. Sargassum muticum thrives in strong currents, so weak currents would likely rule it out.\n\n4. **Biofouling Assessment** - This affects Tilapia. Tilapia are excluded in environments with low biofouling rates.\n\n5. **Oxygen Level Measurement** - This affects Tilapia. Tilapia do not survive in very low oxygen levels, so they would be excluded if oxygen levels are very low.\n\n6. **Aerial Drone Survey** - This affects Tilapia. Tilapia are not typically associated with large schools, so this would rule them out as a possibility.\n\nGiven these analyses, we can see that the **Parasite Load Measurement** study immediately rules out Rainbow Trout because of its high parasite load requirement.
