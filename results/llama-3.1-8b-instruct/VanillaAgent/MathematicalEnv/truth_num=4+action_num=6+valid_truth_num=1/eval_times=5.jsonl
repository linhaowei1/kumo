Let's perform the 'Assess Integral Relationships' to see if it does or doesn't apply to our problem.\n\n <ANSWER> Assess integral relationships </ANSWER>", "Given the observation that 'Non-standard integral paths required', let's examine the implications for the Residue Theorem. The Residue Theorem is typically used when the integral is solvable using its method, involving standard paths. If non-standard paths are required, it means the Residue Theorem is not applicable. \n\nThe observation is indicative of a situation where the integral path cannot be represented as a regular contour integral over the real number line. Since the Residue Theorem deals with standard integrals along a particular path, the necessity for non-standard paths does not align well with it. Thus, we should rule out this option.\n\nHowever, since 'non-standard integral' was required, what we should look at now is how other theorems might allow such integrals, and further, to see which theorem is left after such filtering.\n\n\nGiven  these thoughts, and since 'zorns Lemma', 'Cantor’s Theorem', 'Inclusion Exclusion Principle', have not lead us to any of the clues directly as  has this integral idea, In the next round, the suitable selection of an action_name to continue elimination of these less suitable options should logically, focus on operations to have a better insight from Integrals relation with these.\n\n\nSo let’s examine another key item stated to consider when other integrals cannot solve integral problems easily following\nnon-standard paths.\n\n\n\nThe key item in this guidebook to achieve our end goal, seems to evaluate what was said earlier ( EARLIER OUTCOME ={'action': 'Assess integral relationships', 'observation': 'Non-standard integral paths required'}).

Here, the connection is found in their diverse applications across different mathematical disciplines.\n\nInitially, none of these theorems seem to be directly related to either 'Analyze polynomial roots' or another such specific task, which narrows choice significantly.
