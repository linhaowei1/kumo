This can help us understand whether the economy is characterized by perfect competition, monopolistic competition, or even a monopoly.\n\nAdditionally, analyzing market competition is a good starting point because it can be directly related to two of the economic models: Ecological Economics and Monopoly Theory. Ecological Economics focuses on the relationship between economic systems and the ecological environment, but it also considers the impact of competition on the environment.

Investigating public debt sustainability seems like a useful next step, as it can help us understand the relationship between government spending and public debt, which can be influenced by different economic models.\n\nSpecifically, we can use the fact that Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) suggests that countries with their own currencies can manage economy-wide spending without necessarily adhering to traditional budget constraints. This implies that MMT would be more likely to be associated with high public debt levels.
