Chloroform and Octane will not.\n\n<ANSWER> Reaction with dilute acid </ANSWER>\n", "The observation is \"no_effervescence\" after reacting with dilute acid.\n\nBased on the guidebook:\n\n- **Effervescence Observed**: If bubbling or gas release occurs, **Octane** is ruled out.\n- **No Effervescence**: Sodium Bicarbonate is ruled out as it would normally produce effervescence.\n\nSince there was no effervescence, we can rule out Sodium Bicarbonate.\n\nRemaining possibilities: Chloroform, Octane.\n\nTo differentiate between Chloroform and Octane, let's use the \"Reaction with dilute base\" experiment.
