To further investigate the brightness and pinpoint the exact object, Infrared Imaging is a suitable choice to look for infrared emission indicative of Nascent Stars in Star Formation Regions, but since that doesn't fit the mapped surface, it hints toward a surface mapping.

The object's visual confirmation suggests that it's not a Kuiper Belt Object, as its surface mapping doesn't reveal its icy composition. The absence of infrared emission and the lack of a corona during coronagraphy confirm that it's not a Star Formation Region or a Neutrino Burst. Although photometry yielded a similar value, it might be due to other factors or the faintness of the object.
