This comparison will further emphasize differences or similarities among the likely candidates.\n\n<ANSWER> Vocabulary Usage Comparison </ANSWER>", "Since we observed American English terms, we can confirm that Australian English does not exactly fit this observation, as it also contains American English terms in the mentioned experiment.
