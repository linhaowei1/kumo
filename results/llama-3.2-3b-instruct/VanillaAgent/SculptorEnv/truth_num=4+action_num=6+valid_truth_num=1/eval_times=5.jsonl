However, the observation from the previous stylistic comparison pointed towards classical style, which Yayoi Kusama does not lean towards, making her less likely. Raman Spectroscopy seems a suitable next step to rule out other sculptors, while providing a nuanced clue about the physical properties of the artwork.", "<ANSWER> Raman Spectroscopy </ANSWER>\n\nRaman Spectroscopy can provide information about the molecular composition of the phosphorescent material identified in the previous luminescence imaging. This might not directly identify the sculptor, but potentially provide insight into the specific material used in the artwork, helping to narrow down the possibilities.", "<ANSWER> Provenance Documentation Review </ANSWER>\n\nThe Raman Spectroscopy result indicates that the pigment used in the artwork is not recognized, which eliminates many possibilities. Since no provenance records were documented earlier and the specific absence of pigment peaks hints that the sculpture might be a reproduction or an artwork with a novel construction rather than using common art materials, making an educated guess on Yayoi Kusama is viable.", "<ANSWER> Luminescence Imaging </ANSWER>\n\nThe current observations don't suggest Yayoi Kusama, as her works often exhibit luminescence properties, and we've already completed that technique. The Raman spectroscopy didn't reveal any common pigment peaks, and without other physical properties, this analysis might not be conclusive. Furthermore, given that no provenance records were found and the Raman spectroscopy didn't provide any information on material composition, a new technique such as Luminescence Imaging seems to gather more information and provide new insights or confirm existing assumptions about the artwork's luminescence properties.", "<ANSWER> Stylistic Comparison </ANSWER>\n\nMy reasoning is that, despite completing Luminescence Imaging, which revealed phosphorescence, no pigment peaks were identified, and thus, the material properties of the sculpture remain unclear. The classical style was already strongly implied in the initial observation. To further analyze and confirm the sculptor, this technique seems to gather more insights, and a detailed comparison of the artwork's style to known styles will be more definitive.", "<ANSWER> Provenance Documentation Review </ANSWER>\n\nI previously identified 'Classical Style', and now, even though that style aligns with known styles of Edvard Eriksen and Fernando Botero, I wouldn't be able to confirm either sculptor due to the lack of provenance records. While the classical style ties Edvard Eriksen seemingly to the evidence, immeasurable education and provenance that tied Fernando Botero to the classical style as well would provide conclusive evidence. Since both sculptors fit classical style individually, further investigation into documentation during their lifetime is critical to differentiation between sculptors, identifying a process that limited common outside possession choices and should lead us to identify Fernando Botero or Edvard Eriksen of the two sculptors based on limited documentation and only one sculptor seemed to fulfill classic documentation requirements, albeit botero.", "<ANSWER> Luminescence Imaging </ANSWER>\n\nSince we have ruled out provenance records and luminescence imaging had already been used expecting Yayoi Kusama, delaying its use while looking at more assumed identifications may be our next step to consider the influence based on existing observations in classical style that should include recalling similar physical properties.", "<ANSWER> Photogrammetry </ANSWER>\n\nMy reasoning is that luminescence imaging and Raman spectroscopy didn't reveal any new information about the material or provenance of the sculpture, but photogrammetry is a technique that can create a 3D model of the sculpture, allowing us to better understand its physical properties and potentially identifying features that might not be visible on a 2D representation. Furthermore, photogrammetry can be used to rule out the sculpture being Yayoi Kusama, as her typically features are visible in the 3D model, and might disprove any structural assumptions about the sculptor and a plan to compare creations against existing materials using photogrammetry using intersecting planes or edge collections via a computation widely proved.", "<ANSWER> 3D Laser Scanning </ANSWER>\n\nMy reasoning is that the photogrammetry model has severe deviations, which suggests that the sculpture may be carved using unconventional methods or materials, or it may be an inaccurate or incomplete 3D model.
