However, the energetic anomalies and the moderate quantum field disturbances suggest that the entity may be operating at a lower level, potentially not affecting the psychoactive fields directly.\n\nGiven the inconsistent results, I will predict that the entity may not have **Psychoactive Field Emission** as a trait.
