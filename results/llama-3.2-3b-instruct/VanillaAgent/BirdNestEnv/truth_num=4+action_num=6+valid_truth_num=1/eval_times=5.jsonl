However, based on the physical presence and the uncommon characteristics Flamingo nests hold, the decisive clue when given seems to be the 'Presence of Mud' and 'Egg Color Patterns'.

Therefore, I will choose not to perform any further actions with mud-based choices.\n\nHowever, since a specific nest type remains unexcluded and an action choice is still present, I would prefer to use the observation 'Presence of Mud' as the basis to focus further on another characteristic; looking into the egg color patterns as an aid to determine the presence or absence of another possible trait (Egg examination always shows result whether patterned and solid-colored).\n\nHowever with no additional information on whether the nest even contains eggs, the decision is taken on the basis of randomly selecting.

This action will help me eliminate certain nest types based on where the nest is found in the forest. Specifically, if the nest is found in a tree, I can immediately rule out a Blackbird Nest, as Blackbird Nests are typically found in trees.\n\n<ANSWER> ${Location Analysis} </ANSWER>", "Based on the observation that the nest is located in a tree, I will choose 'Observation of Nest Activity'. This action will help me determine if the nest is diurnal (active during the day), which could rule out a Swan Nest (known for diurnal activity).\n\n<ANSWER> ${Observation of Nest Activity} </ANSWER>", "Based on the previous observation of nocturnal activity, I will choose an action that does not rely heavily on activity patterns. I will select 'Nest Material Examination' to examine the materials used in the nest, which may provide clues about the type of bird responsible.\n\n<ANSWER> ${Nest Material Examination} </ANSWER>", "With the observation that the nest consists of feathers and soft materials, I can rule out Falcon Nests (which tend to use mud and saliva in their construction) but cannot directly rule out another type. Since no specific clue is given, I will select a generic action to further narrow down possibilities. Therefore, I choose to perform 'Height Measurement' to determine if the nest's height can be used to rule out any specific nest type.\n\n<ANSWER> ${Height Measurement} </ANSWER>", "Based on the measurement of 0.7281922353731066 meters, the nest is approximately 0.73 meters above the ground. This information suggests that it is not a likely location for a Falcon Nest (which are typically close to the ground) or a Heron Nest (which are often found near water at ground level). Since the nest is higher than 0.5 meters and inspecting other factors provides further guidance, I will choose an action that examines the camera angle of the observer, which is represented by the observation result. \n\n<ANSWER> ${Location Analysis} </ANSWER>", "Since the observation is that the nest is a tree nest, and the previous action 'Height Measurement' already ruled out the Falcon Nest, and Heron Nest can be ruled out if the stable test for heron is attempted, I'm going to choose 'Height Measurement' as the next action. \n\n <ANSWER> ${Height Measurement} </ANSWER>", "Since the height measurement didn't reveal any substantial results that would help us rule out the given possibilities, I'll choose to examine the nest stability. This action has already been performed previously with a partial success.\n\n<ANSWER> ${Nest Stability Test} </ANSWER>", "The observation from the Nest Stability Test suggests that the nest has a stability level of 8.47, which falls within the typical range of Blackbird Nests.

This will allow us to gather initial clues about the nest type.\n\n<ANSWER> ${Nest Material Examination} </ANSWER>", "<ANSWER> ${Nest Entrance Size} </ANSWER>\n\nThe presence of lichens and spider silk in the nest suggests that the nest is of a bird that builds its nest using plant material, which is consistent with the Swift Nest. However, a limited number of entrance sizes eliminates some possibilities, and we still need more information.", "<ANSWER> ${Egg Examination} </ANSWER>\n\nGiven the entrance size of 70.004355779108 cm, this is larger than the typical size of a Swift Nest, which rules out Swift Nest. Since we have a large entrance size, it's more likely to be the Oystercatcher Nest or the Pheasant Nest. By examining the eggs, we can determine if the eggs are striped, which would be a characteristic of the Pheasant Nest. If the eggs are striped, it would likely be a Pheasant Nest.", "<ANSWER> ${Egg Color Patterns} </ANSWER>\n\nSince the eggs are 2.9275217474633557 cm in size, we can't accurately determine the type of bird just yet. However, we know that the eggs are solid colored, which doesn't match the characteristics of the Finch Nest. We can rule out the Finch Nest. Given that the eggs are solid colored, it's more likely that the Pheasant Nest.", "<ANSWER> ${Egg Color Patterns} </ANSWER>\n\nThe eggs are speckled, which doesn't match the characteristics of the Pheasant Nest (solid color) and also doesn't match the characteristics of the Finch Nest (solid color). This new information, combined with the previous observations, suggests that it's unlikely to be the Pheasant Nest or the Finch Nest. The only remaining possibility is the Oystercatcher Nest.", "<ANSWER> ${Observation of Nest Activity} </ANSWER>\n\nConsidering the speckled eggs and the relatively large entrance size, it's likely that the nest is being actively used. Observing the nest activity will help confirm whether it's indeed an Oystercatcher Nest, which is known for its nocturnal behavior, or if it's another bird species.", "<ANSWER> ${Egg Color Patterns} </ANSWER>\n\nAlthough the nest activity is crepuscular (active at twilight hours), the fact that the eggs are speckled suggests that the nest type is unlikely to be the Pheasant Nest. Given the previous observations and the current activity pattern, I'm going to rule out Pheasant Nest. However, without a definitive conclusion, I'll choose to examine the egg color patterns again for further insight.", "<ANSWER> ${Nest Entrance Size} </ANSWER>\n\nAlthough we've already observed the entrance size to be around 70.004355779108 cm, which initially suggested the Oystercatcher Nest, the presence of crepuscular activity and speckled eggs make it less likely. However, re-examining the entrance size might still provide additional insight. Additionally, the mud presence observation might help rule out the Oystercatcher Nest. \n\nThis time, I'll look into the mud presence.", "<ANSWER> ${Presence of Mud} </ANSWER>\n\nConsidering the crepuscular activity and the large entrance size, I'm inclined to rule out the Oystercatcher Nest. However, the presence of mud in the nest is a crucial factor. The Pheasant Nest is known for using mud in its nesting process, which would explain the presence of mud. Therefore, I'll examine the presence of mud to further confirm the nest type.", "<ANSWER> ${Nest Material Examination} </ANSWER>\n\nAlthough we've already determined that the Pheasant Nest is unlikely due to the mud absence, re-examining the nest material might provide additional insight. However, given the absence of mud, the presence of lichens and spider silk, and the crepuscular activity, I believe it's time to make an educated prediction about the nest type. Based on the available information, I predict that the nest type is likely to be the Swift Nest.", "<ANSWER> ${Nest Entrance Size} </ANSWER>\n\nI want to re-examine the entrance size to confirm the result. A size of 70.004355779108 cm seems relatively large for a Swift Nest. Given that we previously ruled out the Swift Nest but the other options seem less likely, I'll take another look at the entrance size to ensure I'm making the correct decision.", "<ANSWER> ${Nest Entrance Size} </ANSWER>\n\nSince the entrance size is 70.004355779108 cm, which corresponds to the Oystercatcher Nest's typical entrance size, I'm going to predict that the nest type is the Oystercatcher Nest. This conclusion is based on the elimination of other possibilities through the previous examination results.", "<ANSWER> ${Nest Material Examination} </ANSWER>\n\nLet's examine the materials used in the nest again to confirm the identification.", "<ANSWER> ${Nest Entrance Size} </ANSWER>\n\nSince we've already confirmed the entrance size to be 70.004355779108 cm, which matches the Oystercatcher

Since the nest is an enclosed spherical nest, located in a tree, and contains mud and saliva, I will select 'Thermal Imaging' as my action.
