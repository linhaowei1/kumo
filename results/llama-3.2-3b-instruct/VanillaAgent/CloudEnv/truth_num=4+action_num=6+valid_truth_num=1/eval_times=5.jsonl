Given that the altitude assessment resulted in a low altitude range (0-2000m), the surface wind direction might be playing a crucial role in determining the type of cloud present. This could influence the classification of clouds, especially **Stratus fractus**, **Stratocumulus castellanus**, and possibly **Altostratus radiatus**, depending on their forms. \n\nHowever, we do not know the wind direction or whether the cloud is straight or fragmented. More information is needed to choose amongst those cloud types according to wind direction.", "<ANSWER> ${Cloud Coverage Measurement} </ANSWER>\n\nSince the observation from the surface wind direction is southerly winds, and considering the altitude assessment result was low altitude (0-2000m), we know that the likely cloud type is one that occupies this altitude range. The fact that we know the surface wind direction and its effect, however, does not rule out the attic stratus type. Given we have the altitude range, one can observe if it is possible to further narrow the category by determining the extent of coverage, and set the conditions to discriminate which type may be occurring at this altitude range.", "<ANSWER> ${Cloud Motion Speed} </ANSWER>\n\nSince the observation from the cloud coverage measurement is overcast, and considering the surface wind direction is southerly winds and the altitude assessment is low altitude (0-2000m), it's crucial to assess the speed of the cloud's movement. This is because **Stratus fractus** is a relatively stationary cloud type, whereas **Altostratus radiatus** and **Stratocumulus castellanus** tend to have slower movement speeds that increase the likelihood of a low altitude cloud, given that wind of 1-15 m/s has a slower and relatively stable speed than in gerest thick stratus. Considering these conditions, and that 'Cloud Motion Speed' can help us narrow down the cloud type, by examining the speed of cloud movement, which can indicate whether it's fast or slow moving", "<ANSWER> ${Cloud Motion Speed} </ANSWER>\n\nThe observation from the cloud motion speed indicates slow movement (0-10 km/h), and since that cloud type tends to be slow-moving or at low depths on low pressure systems locations,  the analysis rounds out a point of strong argument towards the presence of **Stratocumulus castellanus**.", "<ANSWER> ${Cloud Shape and Structure Analysis} </ANSWER>\n\nAt this point, with the slow movement at low altitude and overcast conditions, we need to further analyze the shape and structure of the clouds to confirm our suspicion of **Stratocumulus castellanus**.
