However, because the original goal was to identify the COL1A1 mutation and given the genotype of the sample should be free from it as suggested by both DNA sequence and melting curve analyses, there isn't a substantial reason to defocus on epigenetic aspects. Since COL1A1 mutation is ruled out and HRM did not find any unusual melting curves, it's clear the COL1A1 mutation is not likely, so the GJB2 is confirmed out due to the oligonucleotide hybridization. Considering the sequence data and shaping up the concise chain of evidence to point at COL1A1, let 's also have a closer look at the MTHFR, as the precise details of this, however, will only be solved by methylation-specfic PCR when trying to focus on identifying the ketoacid transporting proteins - sided mutations as spectrorestrias leading conclusions amongst mutantogen levels.", "<ANSWER> ${RNA sequencing} </ANSWER>\n\nReasoning: Although the methylation-specific PCR analysis indicated a normal methylation pattern, which rules out the MECP2 mutation, proving the absence of other mutations such as MTHFR, or GJB2 requires further confirmation that the pattern of RNA transcripts is corresponding to a COL1A1 null genotype. The absence of MECP2 and the recent findings on other mutations can help focus its determination. RNA sequencing analysis provides extensive random sampling across the transcriptome.", "<ANSWER> ${RNA sequencing} </ANSWER>\n\nReasoning: Given the obtained RNA sequencing result's abnormal transcript levels, auxiliary RNA sequencing is possible but ultimately, seems wasteful as the changed expression isn't this time.
