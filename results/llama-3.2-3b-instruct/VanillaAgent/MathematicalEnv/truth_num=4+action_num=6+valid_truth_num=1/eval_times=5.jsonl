This helps to exclude 'Desargues' Theorem from the possible list of theorems.\n\nAlso, considering Euler's Formula (for polyhedra) is associated with polyhedra and connectivity, using 'Analyze connectivity' might be useful.\n\nHowever, Hall's Marriage Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus are not related to the geometric figure in the question.

Additionally, the \"Connectivity\" check results in a connected graph.\n\nConsidering that Hall's Marriage Theorem is more applicable to combinatorics or bipartite graphs, and we have no information about it being used here, we can narrow it down.
