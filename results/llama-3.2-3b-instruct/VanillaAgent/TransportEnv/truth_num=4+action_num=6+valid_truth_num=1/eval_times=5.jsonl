Since human DNA was found, it is possible that the transportation method relied on or utilized human characteristics such as energy and motion produced by a human driver, like horses or athletes. Sonic signature analysis can help identify the types of energy emissions or sounds typically associated with certain transportation methods, which would be important indicators in this context.

The results of the energy emission detection and biological remains analysis suggest that the civilization used a relatively low-energy method, such as horse-drawn carriages.
