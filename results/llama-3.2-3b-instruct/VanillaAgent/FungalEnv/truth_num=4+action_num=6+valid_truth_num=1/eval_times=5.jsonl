Although it's an initial state, the fungal species list and experiments do not directly indicate a specific pathogen or holder for the suspected fungal infection without more details on the observations or test outcomes.\n\nConsidering the lack of initial symptoms and the implications of each experiment, I will take an attempt with an experiment that could potentially provide early insight or foundation into the decision-making process.\n\nI'll choose an experiment to gather more foundational information: `DNA sequencing`.\n\nIn subsequent rounds, as more information or test outcomes become available, more targeted and conclusive decisions can be made about ruling out or identifying fungal species. \n\n<ANSWER> DNA sequencing </ANSWER>", "Based on the observation that the DNA sequencing matches Fusarium spp., this suggests that Fusarium spp. is part of the fungal species group that has been excluded. However, the current mapping only provides a general exclusion and does not directly link the presence of Fusarium spp. or any of the other listed species with a known host or specific growth conditions. \n\nTherefore, with the provided information and given that Fusarium spp. was listed as the match for DNA sequencing, the next step should aim to broaden the analysis by excluding a new set of fungal species.\n\nLet's choose an experiment to **Alayer the identification** in this process, specifically, `Pathogenicity test on host plant`. This approach can potentially help it to acquire more information about a suspected pathogen and relation to known plants, especially when narrowing down based around that host.\n\n<ANSWER> Pathogenicity test on host plant </ANSWER>", "Based on the observation that the fungus causes wilting symptoms, I will try to find a more specific fungal species that typically causes wilting. From the initial fungal species list, I can think of a fungus that typically causes wilting symptoms on plants.\n\nGiven the list of species and the information from previous tests, I'm inclined to lean towards eliminating a few species based on their growth habits.\n\nMy next action is to choose an experiment: `Temperature growth profiling`. This experiment might help narrow down the possibilities further based on the temperature ranges where certain fungal species typically grow and produce spores.\n\n<ANSWER> Temperature growth profiling </ANSWER>", "Based on the observation from the temperature growth profiling experiment, the fungus seems to be growing optimally in temperatures between 0-20°C. Given that this range was previously identified as a potential exclusion criteria for certain species. Based on this observation, I'm inclined to lean towards excluding Erysiphe cichoracearum from consideration since it was previously ruled out due to growth in other temperature ranges. Now after observing a different temperature profile however it cannot be reduced at this point.\n\nMy next action is to choose an experiment: `Microscopic spore identification`. This experiment will help gather more specific information about the shape, size, and other characteristics of the fungus.\n\n<ANSWER> Microscopic spore identification </ANSWER>", "Based on the observation that no chlamydospores were observed during microscopic spore identification, I can start to rule out some fungal species. This is because the absence of chlamydospores is a characteristic shared by many species in the Pneumochaet соглас list, among which some are newly included as fungal residues through  applied fungal analyses.\n\n\nGiven that I had ruled out Erysiphe cichoracearum based on temperature growth profiling, and considering the new information from microscopic spore identification, I would like to choose an experiment to further narrow down the possibilities.\n\n\nI choose: `Fungal culture testing` \n\nAlternatively, I could predict a truth_name, taking into account the new information and the fungi unaffected by temperature ranges.\n\nA good candidate: `Diplocarpon rosae`"], "consumed_tokens": 9837, "observations": [null, {"action": "DNA sequencing", "observation": "Sequence matches Fusarium spp."}, {"action": "Pathogenicity test on host plant", "observation": "Causes wilting symptoms"}, {"action": "Temperature growth profiling", "observation": 29.074555796945965}, {"action": "Microscopic spore identification", "observation": "No chlamydospores observed"}], "successful": false, "parse_error": true}, {"actions": ["DNA sequencing", "Pestalotiopsis spp.", {"predicted_truth": "Pestalotiopsis spp."}], "generated_text": ["At this initial stage, I will perform a DNA sequencing (round 1) to gather information about the fungal species infecting the crop.

Since the list of available fungal species includes some that can cause diseases in plants, using a pathogenicity test on a host plant is a good starting point to observe disease symptoms.\n\n<ANSWER> Pathogenicity test on host plant </ANSWER>", "Based on the observation that the fungal species causes disease symptoms on tomato, it is unlikely to be Cryptococcus neoformans, which typically does not cause plant diseases. Also, it is more likely than Guignardia bidwellii, which generally causes sunflower and grape berry leaf spot.\n\nConsidering the fungal species' potential to cause disease on a host plant, I suggest performing an 'Antifungal Susceptibility Testing' to evaluate the sensitivity of the observed fungal species to different antifungal agents.\n\n<ANSWER> Antifungal susceptibility testing </ANSWER>", "Based on the previous observation that the fungal species is sensitive to fungicide A, I predict a truth name from the list.

This is because Fusarium spp. can cause diseases in plants and humans, and the ELISA test can help identify specific strains, which may have overlapping characteristics with other fungus species.\n\n<ANSWER> ${ELISA test} </ANSWER>", "Based on the previous observation that the DNA sequencing matches Fusarium spp. and the ELISA test is negative for Verticillium spp., it's likely that the fungus is not Verticillium spp. However, since the DNA sequencing matches Fusarium spp. and there's no mention of Fusarium spp. being present in the original list, this might indicate a potential misidentification.\n\nConsidering the negative result for Verticillium spp. and the possible misidentification, I would predict that the truth name is 'Pseudomonas spp.', as it was present in the original list and the DNA sequencing result does not match any of the other known species.\n\n<ANSWER> ${Pseudomonas spp.} </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 3765, "observations": [null, {"action": "DNA sequencing", "observation": "Sequence matches Fusarium spp."}, {"action": "ELISA test", "observation": "Negative for Verticillium spp."}], "successful": true, "parse_error": false}, {"actions": ["DNA sequencing", "DNA sequencing", "Sugar assimilation test", "Urease test", "PCR assay", "Fungal culture testing", "DNA sequencing", "Cryptococcus neoformans", {"predicted_truth": "Cryptococcus neoformans"}], "generated_text": ["I will choose to perform the 'DNA sequencing' action to gather more information about the fungus species.\n\n<ANSWER> DNA sequencing </ANSWER>", "<ANSWER> DNA sequencing </ANSWER>", "<ANSWER> Sugar assimilation test </ANSWER>", "<ANSWER> Urease test </ANSWER>", "<ANSWER> PCR assay </ANSWER>", "<ANSWER> Fungal culture testing </ANSWER>", "<ANSWER> DNA sequencing </ANSWER>", "Based on the previous observations, the fungus species matches Fusarium spp. but did not grow on PDA media, and PCR assay did not amplify the DNA. This suggests that the fungus is not a typical Fusarium species, as they are often easily detectable by PCR assay.

I choose this action_name because it provides a broad and generalizable method for identifying fungal species by analyzing their genetic material. This approach can help eliminate several fungus species from the list: Pseudomonas spp., Acremonium strictum, and Candida albicans, assuming the DNA sequencing results match a known species other than the target fungus, Cryptococcus neoformans.\n\n<ANSWER> ${DNA sequencing} </ANSWER>", "Based on the observation that the DNA sequencing matches Fusarium spp., I cannot find any direct correlation with the given fungal species 'Cryptococcus neoformans'. However, I can still use the available experiments to narrow down the potential fungal species.\n\nGiven the DNA sequencing result, I will select 'Urease test' as my action_name. This test will help eliminate some fungal species that do not produce the urease enzyme. \n\n<ANSWER> ${Urease test} </ANSWER>", "Based on the previous observations, we have established that the DNA sequencing matches Fusarium spp. and the urease test is positive. However, since Fusarium spp. is not in the list of possible fungal species, we can infer that the DNA sequencing result is incorrect or inconclusive.\n\nConsidering the urease positive result, we can rule out 'Candida albicans' since it does not produce urease. We can also rule out 'Pseudomonas spp.' as it is a bacterial genus, not a fungal one.\n\nThe correct action_name would be to perform a 'Sugar assimilation test' to eliminate 'Cryptococcus neoformans' if it were present, but since 'Cryptococcus neoformans' is still a possible species, I will eliminate 'Pseudomonas spp.' from the list.\n\n<ANSWER> ${Sugar assimilation test} </ANSWER>", "Based on the previous observations, we have established that the DNA sequencing result is inconclusive, the urease test is positive, and the sugar assimilation test indicates that the fungus assimilates glucose only.\n\nGiven the results, we can rule out 'Candida albicans' as it typically assimilates multiple sugars. We also cannot confirm the presence of 'Pseudomonas spp.' since it is a bacterial genus, not a fungal one.\n\nThe positive urease test result and the fact that the fungus assimilates glucose only suggest that the most likely fungal species is 'Cryptococcus neoformans'. However, we still have to confirm this with another test.\n\nSince we cannot change the experimental options, we have to choose from the available options. Considering the previous results, we can try to confirm the presence of 'Cryptococcus neoformans' using the 'ELISA test'.\n\n<ANSWER> ${ELISA test} </ANSWER>", "At this point, we have a positive urease test result and a sugar assimilation test result that indicates glucose only. However, the ELISA test result is negative for Verticillium spp., which might not be a crucial information in this case. \n\nGiven the information collected so far, I am going to predict a truth_name.

Therefore, the species list is now limited to {'Pyrenophora teres', 'Puccinia graminis', 'Hymenoscyphus fraxineus'}.\n\nConsidering the association of white fluffy colonies with the species, a potential truth is that *Pyrenophora teres* is the only remaining species with these characteristics.\n\n '<ANSWER> Pyrenophora teres </ANSWER>'"], "consumed_tokens": 4543, "observations": [null, {"action": "Microscopic spore identification", "observation": "Basidiospores observed"}, {"action": "Colony morphology observation", "observation": "White fluffy colonies"}], "successful": false, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 49, "average_actions": 3.2, "average_tokens": 4424.4, "average_correct": 0.0, "average_parse_error": 0.6, "average_successful_action_num": 0, "average_successful_tokens": 0}
