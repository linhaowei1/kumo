However, we still need to evaluate remarketing to fully narrow down the options.\n\nNext, I will perform the 'Assess remarketing campaign results' analysis to determine if remarketing is also being effectively used.\n\n<ANSWER> Assess remarketing campaign results </ANSWER>", "The observation from the 'Assess remarketing campaign results' analysis shows a score of 3.15, which is relatively low. Based on the exclusion criteria, this score suggests that remarketing is not an effective strategy being used.\n\nGiven the current observations:\n- SEO performance score is 4.63, indicating SEO is an effective strategy.\n- Event attendance statistics are 73.37, indicating experiential marketing could be a viable strategy.\n- Remarketing campaign results are 3.15, suggesting remarketing is not an effective strategy.\n\nSince we have ruled out remarketing, we can now focus on distinguishing between SEO and experiential marketing.
