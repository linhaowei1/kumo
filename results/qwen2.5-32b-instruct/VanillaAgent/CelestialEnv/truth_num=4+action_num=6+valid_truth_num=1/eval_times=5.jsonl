'X-ray Detection' seems like a good starting point since it can rule out a 'Lunar Eclipse' if X-ray emissions are detected.\n\n<ANSWER> X-ray Detection </ANSWER>", "Given that X-ray emissions have been detected, we can confidently rule out 'Lunar Eclipse'. The remaining possible events are 'Black Hole Merger', 'X-ray Detection', and 'Neutrino Burst'. \n\nTo further narrow down the possibilities, I will use 'Direct Imaging'. If a clear visual object can be confirmed, it will rule out 'Neutrino Burst' since neutrino bursts do not provide direct visual images.\n\n<ANSWER> Direct Imaging </ANSWER>", "Since an object was visually confirmed through direct imaging, we can rule out 'Neutrino Burst'. The remaining possible events are 'Black Hole Merger' and 'X-ray Detection'. \n\nTo distinguish between these two, we can use 'X-ray Detection' again to see if the detected X-ray emissions are consistent with an X-ray source or if they are indicative of a more complex event like a 'Black Hole Merger'. However, since 'X-ray Detection' has already indicated the presence of X-ray emissions, it may be more effective to use another technique that can provide additional information.\n\nUsing 'Spectral Analysis' could help because it can reveal emission or absorption lines which might indicate the nature of the X-ray source. If spectral analysis shows specific lines associated with high-energy phenomena, it could point towards 'Black Hole Merger'.\n\n<ANSWER> Spectral Analysis </ANSWER>", "Given that the spectral analysis showed dominant absorption lines, this observation does not provide strong evidence for a 'Black Hole Merger', which typically involves high-energy phenomena that would be more likely to show emission lines. This leaves 'X-ray Detection' as the most plausible event, since it can account for the detected X-ray emissions and the presence of absorption lines.\n\nTherefore, I will predict that the celestial event is 'X-ray Detection'.\n\n<ANSWER> X-ray Detection </ANSWER>", "Given the previous observations, we have:\n\n1. X-ray emissions detected, which rules out 'Lunar Eclipse'.\n2. Object visually confirmed, which rules out 'Neutrino Burst'.\n3.

To further distinguish between these two, we can use 'Radio Astronomy'.
