The presence of music and songs is more common in 'Comedy' as a way to enhance the entertainment factor.\n\n<ANSWER> Music and Song Inclusion Check </ANSWER>", "Given that the play has varied emotional tones and no music or songs, we can lean towards 'Melodrama' as it often features heightened emotional situations without the need for musical elements. To further confirm, we can perform the 'Monologue Frequency Analysis'. If the play has several monologues, it might align more with 'Melodrama', which often includes deep character introspection and exposition through monologues.\n\n<ANSWER> Monologue Frequency Analysis </ANSWER>", "The observation from the 'Monologue Frequency Analysis' indicates a high frequency of monologues, which aligns well with 'Melodrama'.
