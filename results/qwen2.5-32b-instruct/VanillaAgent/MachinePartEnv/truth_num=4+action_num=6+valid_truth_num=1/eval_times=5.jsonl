To differentiate between these two, let's perform an 'Exhaust Gas Analysis'. This test measures the composition of the gases emitted from the engine's exhaust and can provide information on the combustion efficiency. If the analysis shows high CO levels, we can rule out the Throttle Body.\n\n<ANSWER> Exhaust Gas Analysis </ANSWER>", "The 'Exhaust Gas Analysis' observed a high CO level, which indicates that the Throttle Body can be ruled out as the failing part. Therefore, we are left with the Timing Belt as the potential failing part.\n\nGiven the remaining information and tests, we can confidently conclude that the Timing Belt is the failing part.\n\n<ANSWER> Timing Belt </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 7513, "observations": [null, {"action": "Cooling System Pressure Test", "observation": 17.730491999696163}, {"action": "Visual Inspection", "observation": "Damaged Components Found"}, {"action": "Crankshaft End Play Measurement", "observation": 0.05453962060097137}, {"action": "Exhaust Gas Analysis", "observation": "High CO Level"}], "successful": true, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 49, "average_actions": 5.8, "average_tokens": 7112.0, "average_correct": 0.8, "average_parse_error": 0.0, "average_successful_action_num": 6.25, "average_successful_tokens": 7962.75}
