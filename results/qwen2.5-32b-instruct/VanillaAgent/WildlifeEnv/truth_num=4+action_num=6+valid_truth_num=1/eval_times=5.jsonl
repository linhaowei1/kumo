For instance, the size range specified in the guide can help us determine if the Northern Hairy-Nosed Wombat or the Asian Elephant are present.\n\n<ANSWER> Footprint Analysis </ANSWER>", "The footprint analysis returned a value of 0.5186634453915179, which seems to be a normalized or proportional value. However, for the purpose of ruling species out, we refer to the exclusion criteria provided.\n\nThe footprint sizes specified in the guide suggest that if the footprints are found in the size range of 0 to 5 cm, the Northern Hairy-Nosed Wombat can be ruled out. Since our value is outside this range, the Northern Hairy-Nosed Wombat cannot be ruled out yet.\n\nBut according to the guide, for footprints sized 50 cm to 4000 cm, the Asian Elephant is ruled out. The guideline does not specify the exact footprint size of the observed footprint, but we can infer that the Asian Elephant can be ruled out given the significant discrepancy between 0.51 (or 51 cm, if we assume this is the measurement range) and the exclusion threshold of 50 cm for the Asian Elephant.\n\nNow, having ruled out the Asian Elephant, we can use the 'DNA Sampling' method next.
