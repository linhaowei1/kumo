This means no algorithms are excluded based on this observation.

Next, I will perform the 'Delay Tolerance Test' to see if we can rule out any more algorithms based on their sensitivity to delays.\n\n<ANSWER> Delay Tolerance Test </ANSWER>", "The 'Delay Tolerance Test' observation indicates 'Delay Tolerant', which means Robust Control should be ruled out. Now we are left with Optimal Control and Deadbeat Control. To further narrow it down, I will perform the 'Overshoot Measurement' test, which can help us identify if there is minimal overshoot and rule out Deadbeat Control if that is the case.\n\n<ANSWER> Overshoot Measurement </ANSWER>", "The 'Overshoot Measurement' observation indicates a high overshoot of 60.34, which falls within the range (20, 100). This rules out both Optimal Control and Robust Control.
