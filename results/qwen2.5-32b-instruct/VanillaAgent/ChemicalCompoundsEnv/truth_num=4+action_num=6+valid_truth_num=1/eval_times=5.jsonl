This test can help us identify whether the compound has unsaturation (double or triple bonds). Hexane is a saturated hydrocarbon and will not react with bromine water, potentially allowing us to eliminate it if no decolorization occurs. However, if decolorization does occur, we can eliminate Paracetamol, Tetrahydrofuran, and Hexane, leaving Phenanthrene as the potential compound.\n\n<ANSWER> Bromine Test </ANSWER>", "Given the observation from the Bromine Test, which showed decolorization of bromine water, we can eliminate Paracetamol, Tetrahydrofuran, and Hexane. This leaves Phenanthrene as the remaining possible compound.\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy and to confirm our deduction, we can perform the Mass Spectrometry to determine the molecular weight of the compound. Phenanthrene has a molecular weight of 178, which falls into the range of 100 to 200. This will help us to further confirm our hypothesis.\n\n<ANSWER> Mass Spectrometry </ANSWER>", "The mass spectrometry result of 72.74104905640516 does not align with the observations we would expect based on our previous Bromine Test outcome. Given the decolorization of bromine water, we should have expected a molecular weight consistent with Phenanthrene.

Hexane, despite being saturated, could show some unexpected reactivity due to contaminants or experimental error, but its molecular weight is much lower than Phenanthrene.\n\nGiven the mass spectrometry result and the initial Bromine Test observation, let's confirm by using the Beilstein Test, which should show no color change for Hexane, further supporting it as the likely compound.\n\n<ANSWER> Beilstein Test </ANSWER>", "The Beilstein Test observation of a green flame indicates that there are no halogens present in the compound, which aligns with Hexane, Tetrahydrofuran, Paracetamol, and Phenanthrene since none of them contain halogens.
