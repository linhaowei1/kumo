The sharp edges and the moderately cold temperature at the cloud top are consistent with this cloud type.\n\n<ANSWER> Cumulonimbus calvus </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 8005, "observations": [null, {"action": "Atmospheric Stability Assessment", "observation": "Unstable Atmosphere"}, {"action": "Turbulence Presence Detection", "observation": "Turbulence Detected"}, {"action": "Cloud Top Temperature", "observation": "Moderately Cold (-50 to -20°C)"}, {"action": "Cloud Edge Sharpness Analysis", "observation": "Sharp Edges"}], "successful": true, "parse_error": false}, {"actions": ["Cloud Top Temperature", "Turbulence Presence Detection", "Atmospheric Stability Assessment", "Cumulonimbus calvus", {"predicted_truth": "Cumulonimbus calvus"}], "generated_text": ["To narrow down the list of possible cloud types, I will start with an observation method that can potentially eliminate multiple options at once.
