This leaves us with Aniline and Heptane.\n\nNext, let's perform a flash point measurement. This will help us distinguish between Aniline and Heptane, as they have different flash points.\n\n<ANSWER> Flash point measurement </ANSWER>", "The flash point measurement of 123.37°C is quite high. Heptane typically has a much lower flash point, around 20-30°C, so we can confidently rule out Heptane. This leaves us with Aniline.\n\nTo confirm, we can perform a UV-Vis absorption test. Aniline is known to absorb light in a specific range, which can help us verify our hypothesis.\n\n<ANSWER> UV-Vis absorption </ANSWER>", "The UV-Vis absorption measurement of 231.52 nm is within the range where Aniline is known to absorb light. This further confirms that the substance is Aniline, as it aligns with the expected absorption characteristics of Aniline and not the other substances.\n\nGiven the observations from the pH test, flash point measurement, and UV-Vis absorption, we can confidently identify the substance as Aniline.\n\n<ANSWER> Aniline </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 5788, "observations": [null, {"action": "pH test", "observation": 8.080448233960173}, {"action": "Flash point measurement", "observation": 123.3744889835985}, {"action": "UV-Vis absorption", "observation": 231.52218593139142}], "successful": false, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 49, "average_actions": 4.8, "average_tokens": 5382.4, "average_correct": 0.4, "average_parse_error": 0.0, "average_successful_action_num": 5.0, "average_successful_tokens": 5664.0}
