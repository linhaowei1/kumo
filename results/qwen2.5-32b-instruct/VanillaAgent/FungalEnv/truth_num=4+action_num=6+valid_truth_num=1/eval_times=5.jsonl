However, we don't know which specific primers to use at this stage.\n- **Pathogenicity Test on Host Plant**: This can rule out three species if it causes disease symptoms on tomato. Knowing the host plant can be useful to rule out species that don't affect tomatoes.\n- **ELISA Test**: This can also rule out three species if it detects a specific antigen.\n- **SDS-PAGE Protein Profiling**: This can rule out one species if the profile matches pattern Y.\n- **Microscopic Spore Identification**: This can rule out one or two species depending on the type of spores observed.\n- **DNA Sequencing**: This can rule out three species if the sequence matches a specific genus or pattern.\n\nSince we don't have specific information about the symptoms or host plant, we should choose an experiment that can provide broad exclusion. The **Pathogenicity Test on Host Plant** or **ELISA Test** would be strong candidates as they can rule out multiple species if the test results are positive for a specific host or antigen.\n\nLet's choose the **Pathogenicity Test on Host Plant** because it can provide immediate results if the fungus causes disease symptoms on tomato, which is a common host used in such tests.\n\n<ANSWER> Pathogenicity test on host plant </ANSWER>", "Given the observation that the fungus causes wilting symptoms on the host plant, we can narrow down the potential species.
