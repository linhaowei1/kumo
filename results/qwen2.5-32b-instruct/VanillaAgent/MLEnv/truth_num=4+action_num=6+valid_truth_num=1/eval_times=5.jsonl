This will help determine if the model is sensitive to outliers, which can be indicative of the type of model we are dealing with. Support Vector Regression can be more sensitive to outliers compared to Multi-label Classification Models, which typically handle a variety of input types.\n\n<ANSWER> Test Robustness to Outliers </ANSWER>", "The observation indicates that the model is robust to outliers, which suggests that it is less likely to be Support Vector Regression. Given that we have already ruled out K-Means Clustering and Ridge Regression, and that the model is robust to outliers, the remaining plausible model is 'Multi-label Classification Models'. \n\n<ANSWER> Multi-label Classification Models </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 9354, "observations": [null, {"action": "Compute R-squared Score", "observation": 0.31815848240388545}, {"action": "Compute Adjusted R-squared", "observation": 0.04383383967846364}, {"action": "Evaluate Silhouette Score", "observation": 0.16382951998176978}, {"action": "Test Robustness to Outliers", "observation": "Robust to Outliers"}], "successful": true, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 49, "average_actions": 4.8, "average_tokens": 6563.4, "average_correct": 1.0, "average_parse_error": 0.0, "average_successful_action_num": 4.8, "average_successful_tokens": 6563.4}
