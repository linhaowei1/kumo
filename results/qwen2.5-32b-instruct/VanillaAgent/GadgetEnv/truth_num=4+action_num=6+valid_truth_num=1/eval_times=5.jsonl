The remaining gadgets are 'Electro-Magnetic Force Field Generator' and 'Ether-Powered Ray Gun'.\n\nTo further narrow down the options, I will perform the 'Analyze Magnetic Field Strength' experiment. This experiment can rule out the 'Electro-Magnetic Force Field Generator' if the magnetic field strength is below 10 Gauss.\n\n<ANSWER> Analyze Magnetic Field Strength </ANSWER>", "The observation of the magnetic field strength being 4.548 Gauss falls within the range of (0, 10) Gauss, which rules out the 'Electro-Magnetic Force Field Generator'. The only remaining gadget is the 'Ether-Powered Ray Gun'.\n\nGiven that we have ruled out all other gadgets, the malfunctioning gadget must be the 'Ether-Powered Ray Gun'.\n\n<ANSWER> Ether-Powered Ray Gun </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 6889, "observations": [null, {"action": "Analyze Gear Alignment", "observation": "Alignment Within Spec"}, {"action": "Measure Energy Consumption", "observation": 637.9637500433241}, {"action": "Analyze Magnetic Field Strength", "observation": 4.548209811281032}], "successful": true, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 49, "average_actions": 5.4, "average_tokens": 7796.4, "average_correct": 1.0, "average_parse_error": 0.0, "average_successful_action_num": 5.4, "average_successful_tokens": 7796.4}
