This will help us narrow down the possibilities right from the start.\n\n<ANSWER> Detail Observation Task </ANSWER>", "Given the observation from the 'Detail Observation Task' where the student missed many details, we can confirm that 'Attention to Detail' is likely the lacked ability. However, to ensure accuracy and rule out other potential abilities, we can proceed with another test that can provide more information.\n\nThe 'Concentration Exercise' can help us determine if the student lacks 'Attention to Detail' or if there are other underlying issues with concentration. If the student scores poorly on this test as well, it will further support the hypothesis that 'Attention to Detail' is the lacked ability.\n\n<ANSWER> Concentration Exercise </ANSWER>", "The student scored very high (97.70701467059847) on the 'Concentration Exercise', which rules out the lack of 'Attention to Detail' based on this test. However, the previous 'Detail Observation Task' indicated that the student missed many details, suggesting a discrepancy.\n\nGiven this, it would be prudent to perform another test that can help rule out other abilities. The 'Research Project' can help us determine if the student lacks 'Research Skills'. If the student performs well on this project, we can rule out the lack of 'Research Skills' and narrow down further.\n\n<ANSWER> Research Project </ANSWER>", "The 'Research Project' observation indicates that the student's performance was 'Adequate', which rules out the lack of 'Research Skills'.
