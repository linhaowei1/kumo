If the observation does not match the expectations of the Law of Cosines (for example, if trigonometric identities do not hold as expected), this could potentially rule out the Law of Cosines.\n\nTherefore, the most informative next step, given our goal to eliminate possibilities, would be to evaluate trigonometric identities, as this directly relates to one of the remaining theorems.\n\n<ANSWER> Evaluate trigonometric identities </ANSWER>", "Given the observation that the trigonometric identity holds only at specific points, this suggests that the Law of Cosines might not be universally applicable in this context, as it is typically expected to hold for all points that satisfy its conditions (i.e., for any triangle).

Given that we have observations that suggest limitations or specific conditions under which the Law of Cosines might apply, and without direct evidence to rule out the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, the most cautious approach would be to continue gathering information.\n\nSince the question prompts for either an action or a prediction and considering the analysis above, the next step should aim at directly addressing the remaining uncertainty around the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.\n\n<ANSWER> Analyze polynomial roots </ANSWER>", "Given the observation that the number of real roots is less than the degree of the polynomial, this directly relates to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that a polynomial of degree n has exactly n complex roots, which may be real or non-real.
