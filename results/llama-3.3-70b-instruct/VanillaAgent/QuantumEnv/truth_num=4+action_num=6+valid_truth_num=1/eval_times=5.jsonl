However, since the Coherent State typically does not exhibit quantum squeezing beyond classical limits and the observed value does not immediately rule it out based on the provided ranges, we need to consider the next best experiment to gather more information.\n\nThe next logical step is to choose an experiment that can potentially rule out one or more states directly.
