According to the guidebook, this would rule out Scepter of Power, Ring of Water, and Necklace of Healing, which contradicts our initial interpretation. Since all remaining artifacts were ruled out by the outcome of 'Necromantic Essence Present', it appears there was a misunderstanding. Given we are left with no artifacts, let's reassess considering the 'Necromantic Essence Present' condition.\n\nSince none of the remaining artifacts have necromantic essence (as identified in the guidebook), and we ruled out Mirror of Truth by the first test, and now we have a situation suggesting the presence of necromantic essence which shouldn't apply to any of our remaining artifacts, it points to there not being any artifacts left fitting under the rules presented.\n\nThis suggests possibly a reevaluation is needed based on the outcomes. Since the Mirror of Truth should not have sentient magic and was already ruled out, and the current artifacts remaining are ruled out by necromantic presence, a contradiction occurs indicating we need to predict based on remaining plausible artifacts given tests.\n\nGiven 'Scepter of Power', 'Ring of Water', and 'Necklace of Healing' should inherently not have necromantic presence and were ruled out by sentient magic test earlier, this points to possible misinterpretation again, but leads us to logically predict the only non-ruled out artifact in step due to initial tests.\n\n<ANSWER> Scepter of Power </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 4409, "observations": [null, {"action": "Detect Sentient Magic", "observation": "Sentient Magic Detected"}, {"action": "Test for Necromantic Essence", "observation": "Necromantic Essence Present"}], "successful": false, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 13, "average_actions": 3.8, "average_tokens": 3933.2, "average_correct": 0.4, "average_parse_error": 0.0, "average_successful_action_num": 3.0, "average_successful_tokens": 2577.0}
