rule out Neutral Aquifers since they consistently maintain neutral pH levels.\n- **Magnetic Susceptibility Measurement**: A low susceptibility reading would rule out Organic Shales because of their characteristically low magnetic susceptibility.\n- **X-Ray Diffraction Analysis**: The presence of olivine would exclude Glacial Striations, as they typically lack this mineral.\n- **Visible and
