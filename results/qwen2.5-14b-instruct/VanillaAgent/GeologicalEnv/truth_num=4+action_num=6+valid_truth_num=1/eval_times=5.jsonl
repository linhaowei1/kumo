Analysis**: Observing normal oxygen ratios will allow us to rule out Global Average Rocks, as they conform to standard isotopic ratios.\n- **Electrochemical Analysis**: A neutral pH measurement can rule out Neutral Aquifers since they consistently maintain neutral pH levels.\n- **Magnetic Susceptibility Measurement**: A low susceptibility reading would rule out Organic Shales because of their characteristically low magnetic susceptibility.\n- **X-Ray Diffraction Analysis**: The presence of olivine would exclude Glacial Striations, as they typically lack this mineral.\n- **Visible and
