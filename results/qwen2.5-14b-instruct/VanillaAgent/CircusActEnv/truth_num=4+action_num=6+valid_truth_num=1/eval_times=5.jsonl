Given that 'Human Cannonball' is indeed a high-risk performance, this method would be useful to rule it out if we observe a high-risk assessment. However, if we observe a low-risk assessment, we cannot rule out any of the remaining techniques.\n\n2. **Timing and Motion Studies**: This method can directly rule out 'Fire Dancing' if the timing durations are between 0 to 30 seconds, 'Hand Balancing' for durations between 30 to 60 seconds, and does not exclude any techniques for durations between 60 to 120 seconds. This would give us a clear way to narrow down the techniques based on the observed timing.\n\n3. **Grip Strength Test**: This test can rule out 'Foot Juggling' if the grip strength readings are between 50.0 to 100.0. This test is more focused on the grip strength rather than the overall body position or movement.\n\n4. **Weight Measurement**: This method can rule out 'Hand Balancing' if the weight measurements are between 50.0 to 150.0. This is another way to narrow down the techniques based on the weight the performer handles or bears.\n\n5. **Balance Assessment**: This method can rule out both 'Hand Balancing' and 'Foot Juggling' if dynamic balance is required. If static balance is required, this does not exclude any of the techniques.\n\n6. **Muscle Usage Profiling**: This method can rule out 'Hand Balancing' if lower body dominance is observed. If upper body dominance is observed, this does not exclude any techniques.\n\nGiven these considerations, the 'Timing and motion studies' method seems to be the most straightforward to start with, as it can directly rule out 'Fire Dancing' and 'Hand Balancing' based on observed timing durations.\n\n<ANSWER> Timing and motion studies </ANSWER>", "Based on the observation from the timing and motion studies, the duration is 23.852481637567116 seconds, which falls within the range of 0 to 30 seconds.
