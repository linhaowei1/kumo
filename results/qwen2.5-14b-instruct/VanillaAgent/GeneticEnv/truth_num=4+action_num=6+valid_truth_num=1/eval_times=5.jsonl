This leaves us with only the MTHFR mutation as a possible candidate.\n\n<ANSWER> MTHFR mutation </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 5204, "observations": [null, {"action": "Southern blot", "observation": "Normal-sized fragment"}, {"action": "Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)", "observation": "Normal copy number"}, {"action": "ELISA", "observation": 10.001982567918777}], "successful": true, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 49, "average_actions": 5.0, "average_tokens": 5353.6, "average_correct": 1.0, "average_parse_error": 0.0, "average_successful_action_num": 5.0, "average_successful_tokens": 5353.6}
