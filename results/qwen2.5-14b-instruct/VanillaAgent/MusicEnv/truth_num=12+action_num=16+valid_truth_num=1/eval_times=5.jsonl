Evaluating the historical context can potentially rule out large groups of genres based on their historical relevance. Since 'Metal', 'Hip Hop', 'Electronic', 'Indie', and 'Trance' are modern genres while 'Latin', 'R&B', 'New Age', 'Waltz', 'Medieval', and 'Baroque' span a wider range of historical periods, it can help us split the modern genres from the traditional ones.\n\n<ANSWER> Evaluate Historical Context </ANSWER>", "From the evaluation of historical context, we ruled out 'Baroque' and 'Medieval' as they are not modern genres.
