This rules out the 'Lean Burn Engine', 'Supercharged Petrol Engine', 'Turbocharged Diesel Engine', and leaves us with only 'Diesel-Electric Hybrid' as an impossible option since the battery capacity for a Diesel-Electric Hybrid would not be in this high range. Therefore, we can confidently rule out the 'Diesel-Electric Hybrid'.\n\nNext, we need to further narrow down between 'Lean Burn Engine', 'Supercharged Petrol Engine', and 'Turbocharged Diesel Engine'. The next logical step would be to perform a 'Turbo Lag Measurement' to differentiate between these three engine types since a 'Turbocharged Diesel Engine' typically has noticeable turbo lag, while a 'Supercharged Petrol Engine' would have minimal turbo lag.\n\n<ANSWER> Turbo Lag Measurement </ANSWER>", "The observation from the Turbo Lag Measurement is 4.181584685375766, which falls outside the ranges specified for ruling out specific engines.

Since 4.181584685375766 is greater than 2.0, it does not help us directly rule out any engines based on the provided ranges. Nonetheless, given the high value, it suggests the engine is likely not a 'Turbocharged Diesel Engine' or 'Supercharged Petrol Engine', which are more likely to have measurable turbo lag values within the specified ranges.\n\nSince the 'Turbo Lag Measurement' did not provide a clear cut-off, we can now focus on another test to rule out the remaining engines.

According to the guidebook:\n\n- \"High Emissions\" rules out the Hydrogen Fuel Cell.\n- \"Zero Emissions\" rules out the Bi-Fuel Engine.\n\nSince we observed \"Low Emissions,\" it strongly indicates that the engine is not a Hydrogen Fuel Cell, which would have \"Zero Emissions.\" Additionally, \"Low Emissions\" does not rule out the Rotary Engine (Wankel) or the Petrol Turbocharged Engine, but it significantly reduces the likelihood of it being a Hydrogen Fuel Cell.\n\nWe now have the following engine types left:\n- Rotary Engine (Wankel)\n- Bi-Fuel Engine\n- Petrol Turbocharged Engine\n\nTo further narrow it down, we should now perform the Alternative Fuel Compatibility Test to see if the engine can run on alternative fuels, which will help us rule out or confirm the Bi-Fuel Engine.\n\n<ANSWER> Alternative Fuel Compatibility Test </ANSWER>", "The outcome of the Alternative Fuel Compatibility Test was \"Not Compatible\". According to the guidebook:\n\n- \"Compatible\" rules out the Bi-Fuel Engine.\n- \"Not Compatible\" does not rule out the Rotary Engine (Wankel) or the Petrol Turbocharged Engine, but it definitively rules out the Bi-Fuel Engine.\n\nGiven this information, the remaining possible engine types are:\n- Rotary Engine (Wankel)\n- Petrol Turbocharged Engine\n\nTo distinguish between these two, we can perform another test.
