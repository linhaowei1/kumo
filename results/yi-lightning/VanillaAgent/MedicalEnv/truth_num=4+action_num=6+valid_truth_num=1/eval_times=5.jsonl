However, it doesn't confirm Stroke either, since brain lesions could be due to various conditions. We still need to consider other diseases, but we can now focus on ruling out conditions not related to the brain.\n\nSince **Stroke** remains a possibility, we should now target tests that help differentiate between **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)**, **Heart Failure**, and **Colon Cancer**. \n\nGiven that we need to rule out conditions systematically, a **Chest X-Ray** is a good next step because:\n- If the **Chest X-Ray** is normal, we can rule out **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)**.\n- If the **Chest X-Ray** shows abnormalities, it won't specifically confirm ILD but will keep it in the differential diagnosis.\n\nThis approach helps us efficiently narrow down the possibilities.\n\n<ANSWER> Chest X-Ray </ANSWER>", "Based on the observation that the **Chest X-Ray** was normal, we can confidently **rule out Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)**.
