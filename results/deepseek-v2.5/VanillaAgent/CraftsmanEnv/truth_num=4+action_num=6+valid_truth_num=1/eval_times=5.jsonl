We have four tools: Paintbrush, Circular Saw, Air Compressor, and Grinder. The tests we can perform are Speed Test, Temperature Measurement, Air Pressure Test, Magnetic Property Test, Material Compatibility Test, and Durability Test.\n\nGiven that we have multiple tools and tests, the most efficient way to narrow down the options is to perform a test that can eliminate the most tools at once.
