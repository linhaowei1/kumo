Random frequencies do not directly rule out RSA, but it does not provide any evidence in favor of RSA either.\n\n- **DES Cipher**: DES is a symmetric block cipher and its output can appear random, especially with a strong key. However, DES typically does not produce perfectly random frequencies due to its block structure.\n\n- **One-Time Pad**: A one-time pad uses a unique, random key that is as long as the message, resulting in ciphertext that appears completely random.

However, the observed avalanche effect of 60.32% is slightly higher than expected for DES, which might suggest that DES is less likely.\n\n- **One-Time Pad**: A one-time pad should theoretically produce a perfect avalanche effect of 50% because each bit of the ciphertext is completely independent of the others.
