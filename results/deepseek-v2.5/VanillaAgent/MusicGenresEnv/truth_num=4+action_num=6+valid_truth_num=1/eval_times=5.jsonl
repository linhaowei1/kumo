The remaining genres are Easy Listening and Punk.\n\nTo further narrow down the possibilities, let's use another analysis method that can provide distinct characteristics between Easy Listening and Punk. **Live Performance Energy Evaluation** can be useful here, as it assesses the energy level of live performances, which can vary significantly between these two genres.\n\n<ANSWER> Live Performance Energy Evaluation </ANSWER>", "Given the observation from the Live Performance Energy Evaluation that the music has \"High Energy,\" we can refer to the guide to see which genres are typically associated with high-energy performances. According to the guide:\n\n- **High Energy**: No high-energy exclusion rule is present, though genres like Punk naturally have high performance energy.\n\nSince Easy Listening is known for its calm and mellow atmosphere, it is unlikely to have high-energy live performances. Therefore, we can eliminate Easy Listening from the list of possible genres.\n\nAt this point, the only remaining genre is Punk.
