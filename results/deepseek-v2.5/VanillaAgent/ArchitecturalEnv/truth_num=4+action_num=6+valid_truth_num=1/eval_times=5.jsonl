According to the guidebook:\n\n- **Window-to-Wall Ratio (0.5, 1.0)**\n  - Rule Out: Minimalist, as this high window-to-wall ratio is often avoided.\n\nSince the observed window-to-wall ratio is much lower than 0.5, it aligns with the characteristics of Skyscraper Styles, which often have a lower window-to-wall ratio due to their focus on verticality and structural integrity.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently identify the architectural style as Skyscraper Styles.\n\n<ANSWER> Skyscraper Styles </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 6101, "observations": [null, {"action": "Investigate Use of Color", "observation": "Monochromatic"}, {"action": "Study Historical References", "observation": "No Historical References"}, {"action": "Measure Window-to-Wall Ratio", "observation": 0.009079241201942723}], "successful": false, "parse_error": false}, {"actions": ["Investigate Use of Color", "Study Historical References", "Assess Building Height", "Minimalist", {"predicted_truth": "Minimalist"}], "generated_text": ["To narrow down the architectural style, I will start by investigating the use of color, as this comparison can help eliminate styles based on their typical color usage.\n\n<ANSWER> Investigate Use of Color </ANSWER>", "Given the observation that the use of color is monochromatic, we can eliminate Art Nouveau from the list of possible architectural styles.
