This technique can help narrow down the options quickly.\n\n<ANSWER> Resolution Mapping </ANSWER>", "Given the observation from the previous action, which is a 'Happy Ending', we can refer to the exclusion guidelines provided in the guidebook. A happy ending excludes \"Ill-fated Love\" because ill-fated love narratives typically do not have a happy resolution.\n\nNarrative Arcs Remaining: ['Rescue', 'Comedy', 'Survival']\n\nNext, we can use **Thematic Analysis** to further narrow down the options. This technique focuses on identifying and exploring the central themes within the narrative, which can help exclude arcs based on dominant themes.\n\n<ANSWER> Thematic Analysis </ANSWER>", "Given the observation from the previous action, which indicates a theme of 'Power', we can consider how this theme relates to the remaining narrative arcs: 'Rescue', 'Comedy', and 'Survival'.\n\n- **Rescue**: The theme of power could be relevant if the rescue involves overcoming powerful adversaries or using power to achieve the rescue.\n- **Comedy**: While power could be a theme in a comedic narrative, it is less central to the typical comedic structure, which often focuses on humor and wit rather than power dynamics.\n- **Survival**: The theme of power could be significant in a survival narrative, where characters might need to assert power over their environment or other characters to survive.\n\nGiven this analysis, **Comedy** seems less likely to be the central narrative arc if the dominant theme is power. Therefore, we can consider excluding 'Comedy' based on this observation.\n\nNarrative Arcs Remaining: ['Rescue', 'Survival']\n\nTo further narrow down the options, we can use **Climax Evaluation**, which analyzes how the story's most intense point unfolds and its role in the narrative.

A climax intensity in the range of (71, 100) excludes \"Ill-fated Love\" because such a high intensity is less typical of ill-fated love scenarios, which may have more subtle or emotional climaxes.\n\nHowever, since \"Ill-fated Love\" has already been excluded in a previous step, we are left with the remaining narrative arcs: 'Rescue' and 'Survival'.\n\nTo further distinguish between 'Rescue' and 'Survival', we can use **Suspense Identification**, which identifies the presence and degree of suspense throughout the narrative.
