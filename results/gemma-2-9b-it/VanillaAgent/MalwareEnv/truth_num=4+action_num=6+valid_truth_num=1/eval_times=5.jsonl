While behavioral analysis provides insights into overall system behavior, process monitoring allows for a more granular examination of running processes.\n\nHere's why Process Monitoring is the next logical step:\n\n* **Keylogger Detection:** Keyloggers often install themselves as background processes to capture keystrokes without user awareness. Process monitoring can reveal unfamiliar or suspicious processes that might be indicative of a keylogger. \n* **Malware Behavior:** Many malware types, including keyloggers, can manipulate system processes to further their malicious activities.
