The outcome of these experiments will help rule out possible soil types based on observed results. The guide is structured to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.\n\n## Soil Types\n\n1. **Acidic Soil**: This type of soil has a lower pH and can affect plant growth due to the solubility of minerals and nutrients. It often requires liming to neutralize acidity.\n\n2. **Solonchak**: Characterized by high salinity, Solonchaks are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions. These soils often appear white or grey due to the concentration of salts.\n\n3. **Ultisol**: These soils are rich in iron and aluminum oxides and are usually found in humid climates. They are typically highly leached and have a lower fertility level without proper management and fertilization.\n\n4. **Desert Soil**: Found in arid regions, these soils are typically coarse-textured and have low organic matter. They can have high mineral content but often lack sufficient moisture for plant growth.\n\n## Experiments and Interpretations\n\n### 1. Electrical Conductivity Test\nThe Electrical Conductivity (EC) Test measures the soil’s ability to conduct electricity, which correlates with the soil's salinity levels.\n\n- **Outcome Range (0.0 - 2.0)**: This outcome **excludes Solonchak**. Other soil types remain possible.\n  \n- **Outcome Range (2.0 - 4.0)**: No specific soil type is indicated or ruled out.\n  \n- **Outcome Range (4.0 - 16.0)**: No specific soil type is indicated or ruled out.\n\n### 2. Soil Nitrogen Test\nThis test measures the nitrogen content in the soil – a vital nutrient for plant growth.\n\n- **High Nitrogen Level**: If observed, this rules out Desert Soil, which typically has low organic matter and nitrogen content.\n  \n- **Low Nitrogen Level**: No specific soil type is directly ruled out.\n\n### 3. Soil Calcium Test\nCalcium is essential for cellular functions in plants, and this test identifies its concentration in the soil.\n\n- **High Calcium Level**: When observed, rules out Acidic Soil, which usually has low calcium levels.\n  \n- **Low Calcium Level**: No soil types are directly ruled out based on this result.\n\n### 4. Soil Sulfur Test\nSulfur is another important nutrient for plants, and this test helps determine its availability in the soil.\n\n- **High Sulfur Level**: No direct soil type exclusions occur with this outcome.\n  \n- **Low Sulfur Level**: Rules out Acidic Soil, as these soils potentially may lack sulfur.\n\n### 5. Soil Respiration Test\nThis test measures the rate of carbon dioxide release from the soil, indicating microbial activity and organic matter decomposition.\n\n- **High Respiration Rate**: Observing this rate rules out Desert Soil, which typically has low microbial activity due to a lack of organic matter.\n  \n- **Moderate Respiration Rate and Low Respiration Rate**: No specific soil type is ruled out.\n\n### 6. Soil Porosity Measurement\nPorosity indicates the void spaces in soil, affecting water and air movement.\n\n- **Outcome Range (0.0 - 35.0)**: No specific soil type is ruled out.\n  \n- **Outcome Range (35.0 - 55.0)**: No specific soil type is ruled out.\n  \n- **Outcome Range (55.0 - 100.0)**: Rules out Ultisol, which typically has lower porosity.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis guide is designed to assist in systematically identifying soil types by exclusion based on experimental outcomes. Through correct execution and interpretation of the above tests, one can confidently narrow down possible soil types and better understand the characteristic properties of a given soil sample.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\n    def simulate_experiment(experiment_name):  \n        outcome = experiment_outcomes[experiment_name]()\n        return outcome\n\n    def analyze_outcome(experiment_name, outcome):\n        print(f\"Outcome of {experiment_name}: {outcome}\")\n        if experiment_name == \"Electrical Conductivity Test\":\n            if outcome < 2.0 :\n                return \"Solonchak is ruled out\"\n        elif experiment_name == \"Soil Nitrogen Test\":\n            if outcome == \"High Nitrogen Level\":\n                return \"Desert Soil is ruled out\"\n        elif experiment_name == \"Soil Calcium Test\":\n            if outcome == \"High Calcium Level\":\n                return \"Acidic Soil is ruled out\"     \n        \n        return \"Other soil types remain possible\"      \n\n \n  \n\n    \n\n    # Game starts here\n\n\n   \n\n    current_soil_types = soil_types.copy()\n     \n    print(f\"Current Possible Soil Types: {current_soil_types}\")\n    while len(current_soil_types) > 1:\n        print(\"Available Experiments:\", experiment_outcomes.keys())\n        action = input(\"Choose an experiment: \")\n        outcome = simulate_experiment(action)\n        print(analyze_outcome(action, outcome))\n        current_soil_types = [soil for soil in current_soil_types if soil not in ruled_out_soils]\n        print(f\"Current Possible Soil Types: {current_soil_types}\")\n    \n    print(f\"The soil type is: {current_soil_types[0]}\")\n\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n", "**Reasoning:**\n\nWe know the following:\n\n* **Soil is NOT Solonchak:** (Ruled out by the EC test)\n* **Soil is NOT Desert Soil:** (Ruled out by the Nitrogen test)\n* **Soil IS NOT Acidic Soil:** (Ruled out by the Calcium test)\n\nThis leaves us with **Ultisol** as the only remaining possibility. \n\n   \n\n\n\n<ANSWER> Ultisol </ANSWER> \n"], "consumed_tokens": 8397, "observations": [null, {"action": "Electrical Conductivity Test", "observation": 0.6560772846186653}, {"action": "Soil Nitrogen Test", "observation": "High Nitrogen Level"}, {"action": "Soil Calcium Test", "observation": "High Calcium Level"}], "successful": true, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 38, "average_actions": 6.2, "average_tokens": 8485.8, "average_correct": 0.6, "average_parse_error": 0.0, "average_successful_action_num": 6.0, "average_successful_tokens": 8337.666666666666}
