philosophies. \n\n1. **Foucault's Power/Knowledge**: This argument is more aligned with Continental Philosophy, which has a significant influence on contemporary debates in critical theory, post-structuralism, and social sciences. It does not align closely with Analytic Philosophy, which emphasizes clarity and precision in language and logical structure.\n\n2. **Dewey's Pragmatism**: Contemporary pragmatism is still relevant in fields like cognitive science and philosophy of science. Dewey's emphasis on experience and practical consequences resonates with modern philosophical discussions, especially in the philosophy of science and ethics.\n\n3. **Heraclitus' Flux Doctrine**: While Heraclitus' concept of constant change is still relevant in discussions about dynamism and complexity in modern philosophy, it is less directly comparable to contemporary philosophies than others on the list.\n\n4. **Hegel's Absolute Idealism**: Hegel's philosophy, while influential, is more associated with 19th-century philosophy and has less direct relevance to contemporary philosophical discussions.\n\nBy comparing the arguments with contemporary philosophies, we can start to rule out options.

Let's start by evaluating the logical coherence of each argument:\n\n1. **Kierkegaard's Knight of Faith**: This argument involves a leap of faith beyond rationality, which might not be easily coherent within a strict logical framework.\n2. **Sartre's Existentialism**: This argument emphasizes individual freedom and subjective creation of meaning, which can be more flexible and less rigidly logical.\n3. **Frege's Sense and Reference**: This argument is deeply rooted in the logical analysis of language and meaning, making it highly coherent in a logical context.\n4. **Heraclitus' Flux Doctrine**: This argument posits constant change and the unity of opposites, which can also be logically coherent but might require a different type of logical analysis.\n\nGiven that Frege's argument is specifically about the logical analysis of language, it is highly likely to be coherent in a logical structure.
