A settling time of 6.2 seconds is plausible for Proportional Control.\n- **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**: LQR systems generally have shorter settling times because they aim to minimize the cost function, including the control effort, which can lead to more efficient and faster responses.\n- **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: MPC can also achieve relatively fast settling times, especially if the problem formulation includes rapid adjustments. However, it generally results in a slightly longer settling time compared to LQR.\n- **Extended Kalman Filter Control (EKF)**: EKF is primarily used for state estimation and works well in uncertain or nonlinear systems. The settling time is generally influenced more by the system dynamics than the filtering aspect, so it can vary but is often similar to LQR or slightly longer.\n\nBased on the settling time observation, we can rule out Proportional Control as it typically results in longer settling times.
