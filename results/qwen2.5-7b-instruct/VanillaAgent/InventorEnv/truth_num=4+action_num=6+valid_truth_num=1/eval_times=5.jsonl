Specifically, this rules out Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, and Wilbur Wright. \n\nNow, we need to determine if the technological analysis aligns with the work of Niels Bohr, who was active primarily in the early to mid-20th century.

However, to further narrow down the possibilities, we can use Geographic Verification to check if the location associated with the prototype matches any known locations where inventors like Wilbur Wright or Niels Bohr were active.\n\nSince the prototype is from the 17th or 18th century, and Niels Bohr was primarily active in the early to mid-20th century, the location verification will most likely rule out Niels Bohr.
