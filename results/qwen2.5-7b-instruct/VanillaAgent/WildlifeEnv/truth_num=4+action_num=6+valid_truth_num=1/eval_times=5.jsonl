This will help us narrow down the possible species. For instance, if the scat size is between 100 and 5000 grams, we can rule out Red Wolves and Asian Elephants. If the scat size is between 5 and 20 grams, we can rule out Red Wolves. This method provides a clear way to eliminate some species and move closer to identifying the correct one.", "Since the scat size observed is 7.3152462156289415 grams, which falls between 5 and 20 grams, we can rule out Red Wolves.
