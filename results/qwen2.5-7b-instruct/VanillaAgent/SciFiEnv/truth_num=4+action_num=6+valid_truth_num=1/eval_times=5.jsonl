The weak magnetic field is a clear criterion that can help us rule out one of the planets. Since Zephyria is characterized by a particularly weak magnetic field, performing this scan will help us eliminate it from the list of potential life-supporting planets.", "<ANSWER> Liquid Water Detection </ANSWER>\n\nRationale: Since Zephyria has been ruled out due to its weak magnetic field, we now have three planets left: Borealis, Aurelia, and Helios. The next step is to perform a Liquid Water Detection scan.

Conducting this scan will help us narrow down the list further.", "<ANSWER> Surface Temperature Measurement </ANSWER>\n\nRationale: Since the Liquid Water Detection scan showed that liquid water is present, we now know that Borealis can be ruled out because it is known for potentially extreme temperatures, which would make it unlikely to have liquid water. This leaves us with Aurelia and Helios. The next step is to perform a Surface Temperature Measurement to further narrow down the possibilities. If the temperature range is within a habitable zone, it increases the likelihood of life-supporting conditions.", "<ANSWER> Oxygen Level Test </ANSWER>\n\nRationale: The Surface Temperature Measurement result of -95.97346078528429 degrees indicates that Borealis can be ruled out as it is characterized by potentially extreme temperatures. We are left with Aurelia and Helios. The next logical step is to perform an Oxygen Level Test to further eliminate one of these planets.

Conducting the Oxygen Level Test will help us determine which of these two planets is more likely to support life.", "<ANSWER> Magnetic Field Assessment </ANSWER>\n\nRationale: The Oxygen Level Test result of 56.48985997862967% indicates that Aurelia is not a planet with extremely low oxygen levels, which aligns with its known characteristics. Since Aurelia is still a possibility, we should perform a Magnetic Field Assessment to rule it out, as Helios is the only remaining planet and is known to have a strong magnetic field. Conducting this scan will help us confirm whether Helios supports life by eliminating Aurelia.", "<ANSWER> Atmospheric Composition Analysis </ANSWER>\n\nRationale: The Magnetic Field Assessment has ruled out Aurelia, leaving us with Helios. To confirm that Helios is the planet that supports life, we can perform an Atmospheric Composition Analysis. Since Helios is known to have high oxygen levels, this scan should confirm its suitability for life. Conducting the Atmospheric Composition Analysis will help us verify that Helios has a nitrogen-rich atmosphere, which is more consistent with known life-supporting conditions.", "<ANSWER> Helios </ANSWER>\n\nRationale: All the scans have been performed, and the results consistently point to Helios as the planet that supports life.
