The weak magnetic field is a clear criterion that can help us rule out one of the planets. Since Zephyria is characterized by a particularly weak magnetic field, performing this scan will help us eliminate it from the list of potential life-supporting planets.", "<ANSWER> Liquid Water Detection </ANSWER>\n\nRationale: Since Zephyria has been ruled out due to its weak magnetic field, we now have three planets left: Borealis, Aurelia, and Helios. The next step is to perform a Liquid Water Detection scan.

Conducting this scan will help us narrow down the list further.", "<ANSWER> Surface Temperature Measurement </ANSWER>\n\nRationale: Since the Liquid Water Detection scan showed that liquid water is present, we now know that Borealis can be ruled out because it is known for potentially extreme temperatures, which would make it unlikely to have liquid water.

We are left with Aurelia and Helios. The next logical step is to perform an Oxygen Level Test to further eliminate one of these planets.

Conducting the Atmospheric Composition Analysis will help us verify that Helios has a nitrogen-rich atmosphere, which is more consistent with known life-supporting conditions.", "<ANSWER> Helios </ANSWER>\n\nRationale: All the scans have been performed, and the results consistently point to Helios as the planet that supports life.
