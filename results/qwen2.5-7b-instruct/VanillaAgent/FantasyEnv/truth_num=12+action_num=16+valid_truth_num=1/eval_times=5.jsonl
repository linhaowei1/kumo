Now, let's use the \"Probe for Divine Magic\" test to further narrow down the possibilities. The \"Sword of Justice\" and \"Wand of Illusions\" are associated with divine magic, but we have already ruled out \"Sword of Justice\". Therefore, we will test \"Wand of Illusions\".\n\n<ANSWER> Probe for Divine Magic </ANSWER>", "Given that the \"Probe for Divine Magic\" test returned \"No Divine Magic,\" we can rule out the \"Wand of Illusions.\" Now, let's use the \"Analyze Symbolic Inscriptions\" test.

The **Belt of Giants** might be more resistant to other elements compared to the others. Therefore, we can test for resistance to ice or lightning, but first, let's use the **Evaluate Heat Signature** to see if any of these artifacts emit a significant heat signature, which would rule out **Orb of Fire** and **Sword of Flames** again but already did so.\n\n<ANSWER> Evaluate Heat Signature </ANSWER>", "Given that the **Evaluate Heat Signature** test scored 91.14851083729647, which is above the threshold for excluding **Orb of Fire** and **Sword of Flames** (values between 70 and 100 exclude them), we can conclude that the artifact is not the **Orb of Fire** or **Sword of Flames**.
