Now, we need to further narrow down the possibilities between Ethylamine, Bases, and Aniline. The Solubility in Water test will help us do this. \n\n- Ethylamine and Aniline are both polar and will be soluble in water.\n- Bases, which are typically ionic or derived from ionic compounds, can also be soluble in water.\n\nSince both Ethylamine and Aniline are polar amines and can dissolve in water, and Bases are generally soluble in water, this test will not definitively rule out any of these three. However, it will help us eliminate Methanol, which is a key step in moving forward. \n\n<ANSWER> Solubility in Water </ANSWER>", "<ANSWER> Melting Point Determination </ANSWER>\n\nGiven that the compound is insoluble in water, we can rule out Methanol. The next step is to use the Melting Point Determination to further narrow down the possibilities between Ethylamine, Bases, and Aniline. \n\n- Ethylamine has a melting point range of -114.1°C to -113.5°C.\n- Aniline has a melting point range of 51.2°C to 51.5°C.\n- Bases generally do not have a specific melting point as they are broad categories of substances.\n\nBy determining the melting point, we can definitively eliminate one of these options.", "<ANSWER> Refractive Index Measurement </ANSWER>\n\nThe observed melting point is 164.4740506346109°C, which matches the melting point of Aniline. This strongly suggests that the compound is Aniline. To further confirm, we can perform the Refractive Index Measurement.\n\n- Aniline has a refractive index range of approximately 1.52 - 1.53.\n- Ethylamine and Bases do not have a specific refractive index range that matches the observed melting point.\n- Methanol has a refractive index range of approximately 1.33 - 1.36, which does not match the observed melting point.\n\nPerforming the Refractive Index Measurement will help us confirm if the compound is indeed Aniline.", "<ANSWER> Bases </ANSWER>\n\nGiven the refractive index observation of 1.4347074848492334, which does not match the refractive index range of Aniline (1.52 - 1.53), we can rule out Aniline. The remaining options are Ethylamine, Bases, and Methanol. Since the melting point of 164.4740506346109°C is characteristic of Aniline, and we have already ruled it out, the compound is most likely Ethylamine or Bases. \n\nTo further confirm, we can perform the Ninhydrin Test, which should show a color change if the compound is Ethylamine or Aniline. Since Aniline has already been ruled out, a color change would indicate Ethylamine.
