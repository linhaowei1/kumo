This comparison will help us rule out Gothic architecture, as it is known for having large window spaces, which would result in a higher Window-to-Wall Ratio. We'll choose a Window-to-Wall Ratio in the range of (0.2, 0.5) to see if it helps us eliminate Gothic and further narrow down the possibilities.", "<ANSWER> Review Use of Geometric Forms </ANSWER>\n\nGiven the Window-to-Wall Ratio is 0.3975880429677513, which falls within the range (0.2, 0.5), we can confirm that Gothic architecture is not a possibility. Now, let's review the use of geometric forms. Art Nouveau often uses geometric forms, particularly rectilinear structures, which would help us distinguish it from the Blobitecture style, which typically does not use rectilinear forms. \n\nBy reviewing the use of geometric forms, we can further narrow down our options. If the structure exhibits rectilinear forms, it is more likely to be Art Nouveau rather than Blobitecture. \n\n<ANSWER> Review Use of Geometric Forms </ANSWER>", "<ANSWER> Inspect Architectural Motifs </ANSWER>\n\nSince the structure exhibits rectilinear forms, we can now inspect the architectural motifs to further narrow down the possibilities. Art Nouveau is known for its ornamental detailing and natural forms, while Skyscraper Styles and Blobitecture do not typically align with these motifs. By inspecting the architectural motifs, we can determine if the style is Art Nouveau, Skyscraper Styles, or Blobitecture. \n\n<ANSWER> Inspect Architectural Motifs </ANSWER>", "<ANSWER> Skyscraper Styles </ANSWER>\n\nGiven that the structure exhibits rectilinear forms and secular motifs, the most plausible architectural style is Skyscraper Styles.
