This examination will help determine if the artwork uses a limited color palette (indicative of Minimalism) or a more varied and expressive palette (indicative of Impasto or Surrealism).\n\n<ANSWER> Color Palette Analysis </ANSWER>", "From the **Color Palette Analysis**, the observation is that **earth tones are prevalent**. This provides additional insight into the artwork's style:\n\n1. **Minimalism**: Minimalism often uses a limited color palette, but it is not necessarily restricted to earth tones. This observation does not rule out Minimalism but also does not strongly confirm it.\n2. **Impasto**: Impasto is more about the texture and application of paint rather than the specific color palette. Earth tones could be used in Impasto, but this observation alone does not confirm or rule out the style.\n3. **Surrealism**: Surrealism often employs a wide range of colors, including earth tones, to create dream-like and symbolic imagery. This observation is consistent with Surrealism but does not definitively confirm it.\n\nTo further narrow down the options, I will perform **3D Surface Profilometry**. This examination will help determine the texture of the artwork, which is particularly relevant for distinguishing between **Impasto** (which has a thick, textured surface) and **Minimalism** or **Surrealism** (which typically have smoother surfaces).\n\n<ANSWER> 3D Surface Profilometry </ANSWER>", "From the **3D Surface Profilometry**, the observation is a surface texture measurement of **0.17286890834787047**.

This leaves us with **Minimalism** and **Surrealism** as the remaining possibilities.\n\nTo further narrow down the options, I will perform **Provenance Research**.

This does not provide conclusive evidence to rule out either **Minimalism** or **Surrealism**, as both styles emerged in the 20th century and could potentially lack documented provenance.\n\nGiven the remaining possibilities (**Minimalism** and **Surrealism**), I will perform **Signature Authentication**.
