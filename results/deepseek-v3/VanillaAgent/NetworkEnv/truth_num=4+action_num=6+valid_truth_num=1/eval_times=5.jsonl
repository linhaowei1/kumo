This is a foundational step because it can immediately rule out protocols that are incompatible with the detected network layer (e.g., IPv4 vs. IPv6). For example, if the network layer is IPv6, we can rule out EIGRP for IPv4, as it does not support IPv6.\n\n<ANSWER> Examining Network Layer Protocol </ANSWER>", "From the observation, we know that the network layer protocol is IPv6.
