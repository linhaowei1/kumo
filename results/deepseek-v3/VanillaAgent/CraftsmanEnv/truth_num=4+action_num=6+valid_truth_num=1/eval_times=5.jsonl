According to the guidebook, no tools are ruled out based on this outcome. This means we still have two remaining tools: **Vise** and **Lathe**.\n\nTo further narrow down the options, I will choose the **Grip Strength Test** next. This test evaluates how effectively a tool can maintain a firm hold or grip on materials or workpieces. If the grip strength is observed to be in the range (0, 5), the **Vise** will be ruled out. This will help us identify the correct tool.\n\n<ANSWER> Grip Strength Test </ANSWER>", "The **Grip Strength Test** result of **3.178099135710764** falls within the range (0, 5). According to the guidebook, this outcome rules out the **Vise**.

This test can help narrow down the options by ruling out tools based on their weight. For example, if the tool weighs between 0 to 2 kg, we can rule out Sandpaper, which is typically lightweight. This will help reduce the number of possible tools to consider in subsequent steps.\n\n<ANSWER> Weight Measurement </ANSWER>", "The weight measurement result is **3.5350343619853586 kg**, which falls within the **2 to 5 kg** range. According to the guidebook, this outcome does not rule out any tools. Therefore, we need to proceed with another test to further narrow down the possibilities.\n\nNext, I will select the **Tool Function Trial** test. This test can help determine whether the tool is capable of performing its intended function, such as fastening or cutting. For example, if the tool is incapable of fastening, we can rule out the Wrench. This will help eliminate one or more tools from the list.\n\n<ANSWER> Tool Function Trial </ANSWER>", "The **Tool Function Trial** result indicates that the tool is **Incapable of Cutting**. According to the guidebook, this outcome allows us to rule out the **Plane**, as planes are designed for cutting and shaping wood. The remaining possible tools are **Sandpaper**, **Cordless Nail Gun**, and **Wrench**.\n\nTo further narrow down the options, I will select the **Chemical Resistance Test**. This test can help determine whether the tool is resistant to chemicals, which could rule out either the **Sandpaper** or the **Wrench** depending on the outcome.\n\n<ANSWER> Chemical Resistance Test </ANSWER>", "The **Chemical Resistance Test** result indicates that the tool is **Not Chemical Resistant**. According to the guidebook, this outcome allows us to rule out **Sandpaper**, as sandpaper is typically not chemical resistant. The remaining possible tools are **Cordless Nail Gun** and **Wrench**.\n\nTo further narrow down the options, I will select the **Cutting Ability Test**. This test can help determine whether the tool has cutting ability, which could rule out the **Wrench** if the outcome is **Poor**.\n\n<ANSWER> Cutting Ability Test </ANSWER>", "The **Cutting Ability Test** result indicates that the tool has **Poor** cutting ability.

Now, the remaining possible tools are: **Cordless Nail Gun**, **Hammer**, and **Clamp**.\n\nTo further narrow down the possibilities, I will perform the **Grip Strength Test**, as it can help eliminate the **Clamp** if the grip strength is found to be in the \"0 to 5\" range.\n\n<ANSWER> Grip Strength Test </ANSWER>", "The **Grip Strength Test** result (0.22698103004856807) falls into the \"0 to 5\" range, which means the **Clamp** should be ruled out for insufficient grip strength. Now, the remaining possible tools are: **Cordless Nail Gun** and **Hammer**.\n\nTo determine the correct tool between these two, I will perform the **Material Compatibility Test**, as it can help eliminate the **Hammer** if the tool is found to be not compatible with wood.\n\n<ANSWER> Material Compatibility Test </ANSWER>", "The **Material Compatibility Test** result is \"Not compatible with Wood,\" which means the **Tile Cutter** should be ruled out. However, the **Tile Cutter** was already ruled out earlier based on the **Sharpness Test**. The remaining tools are **Cordless Nail Gun** and **Hammer**.\n\nTo determine the correct tool between these two, I will perform the **Electrical Conductivity Test** again, as it can help eliminate the **Hammer** if the tool is found to be conductive.\n\n<ANSWER> Electrical Conductivity Test </ANSWER>", "Since the **Electrical Conductivity Test** result is \"Non-Conductive,\" no tools are ruled out based on this test. The remaining tools are **Cordless Nail Gun** and **Hammer**.\n\nTo determine the correct tool between these two, I will perform the **Cutting Ability Test**, as it can help eliminate the **Hammer** if the tool is found to have poor cutting ability.\n\n<ANSWER> Cutting Ability Test </ANSWER>", "The **Cutting Ability Test** result is \"Average,\" which means no tools are ruled out based on this test. The remaining tools are **Cordless Nail Gun** and **Hammer**.\n\nTo determine the correct tool between these two, I will perform the **Sharpness Test**, as it can help eliminate the **Hammer** if the tool's sharpness falls into the \"7 to 10\" range.\n\n<ANSWER> Sharpness Test </ANSWER>", "The **Sharpness Test** result (1.6382951998176978) falls into the \"0 to 3\" range, which does not eliminate any of the remaining tools (**Cordless Nail Gun** and **Hammer**). Since all tests have been performed and no further eliminations are possible, I will now predict the correct tool based on the remaining possibilities.\n\nBetween the **Cordless Nail Gun** and the **Hammer**, the **Cordless Nail Gun** is the more specialized tool, and the **Hammer** is a general-purpose tool.
