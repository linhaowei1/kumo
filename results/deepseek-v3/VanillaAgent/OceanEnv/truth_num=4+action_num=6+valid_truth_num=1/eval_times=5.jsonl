Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me double-check the guidebook.\n\nUpon reviewing the guidebook, I realize there is an error in my earlier reasoning. The guidebook states:\n\n- **Presence of Sea Ice**: If observed, rule out the East Greenland Current.\n- **No Sea Ice**: If observed, rule out the Agulhas Current.\n\nHowever, this seems counterintuitive because the East Greenland Current is known for its association with sea ice.
