Based on the outcome, I can rule out certain soil types, such as Clay Loam if the result shows high sand content. This is a logical first step because it provides foundational information about the soil's composition, which is crucial for further analysis.\n\n<ANSWER> Particle Size Analysis </ANSWER>", "Based on the **Particle Size Analysis** outcome of **High Sand Content**, I can rule out **Clay Loam** because Clay Loam is characterized by higher clay content rather than high sand content. This leaves us with three possible soil types: **Loamy Soil**, **Humus-rich Soil**, and **Gypsisol**.\n\nNext, I will perform the **Moisture Content Test** to further narrow down the possibilities. This test will help determine the water content in the soil, which can differentiate between soil types like Gypsisol (which typically has low moisture content) and others. This is a logical next step because moisture content is a key characteristic that varies significantly among the remaining soil types.\n\n<ANSWER> Moisture Content Test </ANSWER>", "Based on the **Moisture Content Test** outcome of **97.178%**, I can rule out **Gypsisol** because Gypsisol typically has low moisture content, especially in arid or semi-arid regions. This leaves us with two possible soil types: **Loamy Soil** and **Humus-rich Soil**.\n\nNext, I will perform the **pH Measurement** test to further narrow down the possibilities. This test will help determine the acidity or alkalinity of the soil, which can differentiate between Loamy Soil and Humus-rich Soil. Humus-rich Soil is typically more acidic due to its high organic content, while Loamy Soil tends to have a more neutral pH. This is a logical next step because pH is a key characteristic that varies significantly between the remaining soil types.\n\n<ANSWER> pH Measurement </ANSWER>", "Based on the **pH Measurement** outcome of **6.102**, which falls within the range of **5.5 - 7.5**, no soil types are ruled out. This means both **Loamy Soil** and **Humus-rich Soil** remain as possible soil types.\n\nNext, I will perform the **Soil Redox Potential Test** to further narrow down the possibilities. This test measures the soil's oxidation-reduction potential, which can help differentiate between Loamy Soil and Humus-rich Soil. Loamy Soil typically has a higher redox potential, while Humus-rich Soil, with its high organic content, tends to have a lower redox potential. This is a logical next step because the redox potential is a key characteristic that varies significantly between the remaining soil types.\n\n<ANSWER> Soil Redox Potential Test </ANSWER>", "Based on the **Soil Redox Potential Test** outcome of **123.703**, which falls within the range of **0.0 - 400.0**, no soil types are ruled out. This means both **Loamy Soil** and **Humus-rich Soil** remain as possible soil types.\n\nNext, I will perform the **Soil Magnesium Test** to further narrow down the possibilities. This test evaluates the magnesium level in the soil, which can help differentiate between Loamy Soil and Humus-rich Soil. Loamy Soil typically has a lower magnesium level compared to Humus-rich Soil, which is rich in nutrients, including magnesium. This is a logical next step because the magnesium level is a key characteristic that varies significantly between the remaining soil types.\n\n<ANSWER> Soil Magnesium Test </ANSWER>", "Based on the **Soil Magnesium Test** outcome of **High Magnesium Level**, I can rule out **Loamy Soil** because Loamy Soil typically has a lower magnesium level.
