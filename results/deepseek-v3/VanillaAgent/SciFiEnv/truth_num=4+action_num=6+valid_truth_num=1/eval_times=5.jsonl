According to the guidebook, this outcome excludes **Solaris** due to hazardous radiation levels. This leaves **Umbra** as the only remaining candidate.\n\nTo confirm that **Umbra** is the planet that supports life, I will perform the **Tectonic Plate Activity Check**. This scan will help us determine if **Umbra** has active tectonic plates, which are necessary for a dynamic and potentially habitable environment.\n\n<ANSWER> Tectonic Plate Activity Check </ANSWER>", "The **Tectonic Plate Activity Check** result is **Active Tectonic Plates**, which does not exclude **Umbra**. Since **Umbra** is the only remaining candidate after excluding **Gaia**, **Elysium**, and **Solaris**, and it meets the criteria for tectonic activity, we can confidently conclude that **Umbra** is the planet that supports life.\n\n<ANSWER> Umbra </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 5815, "observations": [null, {"action": "Liquid Water Detection", "observation": "No Liquid Water Detected"}, {"action": "Radiation Level Measurement", "observation": 591.4885599453094}, {"action": "Tectonic Plate Activity Check", "observation": "Active Tectonic Plates"}], "successful": true, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 49, "average_actions": 4.8, "average_tokens": 5557.0, "average_correct": 1.0, "average_parse_error": 0.0, "average_successful_action_num": 4.8, "average_successful_tokens": 5557.0}
