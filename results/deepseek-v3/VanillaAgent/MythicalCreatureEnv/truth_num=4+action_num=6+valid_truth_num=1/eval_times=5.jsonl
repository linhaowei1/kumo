Let's evaluate the remaining methods:\n\n- **Nest Investigation**: This could help determine the habitat, but it might not eliminate many creatures at this stage.\n- **Ethereal Presence Detection**: This is useful for identifying Ghosts, so it could be a good choice if we suspect a Ghost.\n- **Oceanic Current Tracking**: This is relevant for Leviathans, so it could help rule out or confirm Leviathan.\n- **Aura Examination**: This provides insights into energy fields but might not eliminate specific creatures immediately.\n- **Magical Residue Detection**: This could help identify magical energies, but it might not be the most efficient next step.\n\nGiven that **Ethereal Presence Detection** can directly rule out or confirm the presence of a Ghost, it seems like a strategic next step.
