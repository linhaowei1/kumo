High renewal rates suggest a segment that is loyal and satisfied with the subscription services, which is less characteristic of Retirees.\n\nTo proceed, I will select the \"Promotional Offer Redemption\" technique.

This will help me understand how consumer demand fluctuates with seasons and related trends. Steady demand might rule out Retirees, whose consumption patterns tend to vary with seasons, often influenced by travel and leisure activities.\n\n<ANSWER> Seasonality Trend Analysis </ANSWER>", "Given the observation of \"Steady Demand\" from the \"Seasonality Trend Analysis,\" I can use this information to further narrow down the demographic segments.
