Since the only remaining artifacts are the Ring of Water and Bow of the Moon, and this test does not provide additional information to exclude either of them, I need to choose another test to further narrow down the possibilities.\n\nNext, I will choose the test \"Analyze Symbolic Inscriptions\" because it can help differentiate between the Ring of Water and Bow of the Moon.
