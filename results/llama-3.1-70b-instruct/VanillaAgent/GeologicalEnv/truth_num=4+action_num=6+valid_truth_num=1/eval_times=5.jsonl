We have no initial information, so we need to choose a test that could potentially rule out the most formations based on its outcomes.\n\nAmong the available tests, the **Chloride Detection Test** seems to be a good starting point. This is because the presence or absence of chloride ions can be a clear indicator of certain geological formations. Specifically, if chloride ions are detected, it could indicate the presence of **Freshwater Lakes**, but if no chloride ions are detected, it would rule out **Freshwater Lakes**.\n\nHowever, considering the broader implications, **Viscosity Measurement of Melts** might not be the best first choice without knowing if we're dealing with a melt. Similarly, seismic and thermal analyses might require more context to be most effective.\n\nReflecting on the guidebook, the **Chloride Detection Test** seems less discriminatory in terms of ruling out multiple formations simultaneously compared to other tests like **Thermal Inertia Measurement** or **Reflectance Spectroscopy**, which could potentially rule out **Volcanic Ash Deposits** directly. However, given the initial state and the simplicity of starting with a straightforward yes/no type of test regarding water bodies, the **Chloride Detection Test** could be a reasonable starting point to gather initial information.\n\nStill, the best initial test to maximize the exclusion of formations based on a single result is likely to be one that can more broadly distinguish between the types of formations listed, such as testing for characteristics unique to specific formations.\n\nConsidering the need to rule out as many formations as possible with the first test and upon further reflection, **Reflectance Spectroscopy** is a more inclusive test that can help differentiate between various geological formations, especially since it can be used to identify the presence of certain minerals or characteristics that are unique to specific formations. \n\nGiven the analysis, **Reflectance Spectroscopy** stands out as a potentially more useful first test because it could provide information that directly relates to the mineral and textural characteristics of the geological formations, potentially ruling out **Volcanic Ash Deposits** if certain spectral signatures are not present.\n\n<ANSWER> Reflectance Spectroscopy </ANSWER>", "Given the observation from the previous action, **Reflectance Spectroscopy** yielded a **High Albedo** result. This outcome is indicative of surfaces with high reflectivity, which can be characteristic of certain geological materials.\n\nConsidering the geological formations in question:\n\n- **High Albedo** is less likely to be associated with **Volcanic Ash Deposits**, which typically have lower reflectivity due to their darker color and finer texture. However, we already used **Reflectance Spectroscopy**, and the guidebook's specific exclusion criteria for **Volcanic Ash Deposits** based on this test require a **Spectral Red Slope** observation, not just high albedo.\n\n- **Granitic Terrain** and **Komatiite Flows** can have varying reflectivity, but high albedo might lean more towards lighter-colored granitic terrains. However, without specific spectral signatures or further information, it's difficult to make a definitive exclusion based solely on this.\n\n- **Freshwater Lakes**, being bodies of water, would typically have variable reflectivity depending on factors like the presence of algae, depth, and the angle of the sun. The high albedo observation doesn't directly rule in or out **Freshwater Lakes** without further context.\n\nGiven the **High Albedo** observation and the need to gather more discriminative information, the next logical step is to perform a test that could potentially rule out or confirm the presence of specific formations based on physical properties not directly related to reflectivity or spectral signatures.\n\n**Thermal Inertia Measurement** could be a useful next step. This test can help differentiate between formations based on their thermal properties, which could provide a clearer indication of the formation's composition and structure. Specifically, certain ranges of thermal inertia can rule out **Volcanic Ash Deposits** (though the guidebook specifies a range of 400.0 to 800.0 units for exclusion, which might not directly apply here without further context) or provide insights into the nature of the other formations.\n\n<ANSWER> Thermal Inertia Measurement </ANSWER>", "Given the observation from the previous action, **Thermal Inertia Measurement** yielded a value of 164.26836709877432.
