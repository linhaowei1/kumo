The information suggests that Ancient Indus Valley (which was not directly ruled out by previous methods) no longer seems like a fit given the 'Carbon Dating' result (1749 CE) which indicates the year 1749. Ancient Indus Valley is known to have flourished until around 1300 BCE, making it a very unlikely option based on this new dating.\n\nDespite our initial dismissals, none provided information directly tied to Ancient Indus Valley and its peer historical periods.
