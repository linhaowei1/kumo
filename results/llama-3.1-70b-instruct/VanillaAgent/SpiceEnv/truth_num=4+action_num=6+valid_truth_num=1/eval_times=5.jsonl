'Moisture Content Testing' does not seem to offer a wide range of exclusion possibilities based on a single result. 'Chemical Composition Analysis' might provide a specific clue, but each outcome is limited to excluding one spice based on the presence of certain compounds.\n\nLooking through our list of spices and experiments again, it appears 'Heat Level Measurement' could provide a good starting point.
