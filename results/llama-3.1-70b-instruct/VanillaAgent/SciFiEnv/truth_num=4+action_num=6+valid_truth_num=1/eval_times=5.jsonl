Given that **Solaris** has hazardous radiation levels, we should exclude it.\n\nHowever, we still haven't found a conclusive match. At this point, we should consider the possibility that one of the excluded planets might actually be a better match than initially thought.\n\nGiven our previous observations and exclusions, the most likely candidate, based on a re-evaluation of our process, should be **Solaris**. However, this contradicts our initial conclusion. We must remember that we are considering a hypothetical scenario where life-supporting conditions might be different from Earth's.\n\nConsidering our previous conclusions and the fact that we excluded **Solaris** based on radiation levels, we should actually consider **Solaris** or one of the other initially excluded planets as the correct answer. Given the exclusions and our process, I will take a chance and predict a planet.\n\n<ANSWER> Solaris </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 6602, "observations": [null, {"action": "Liquid Water Detection", "observation": "No Liquid Water Detected"}, {"action": "Stellar Flux Analysis", "observation": 2.182231471692155}, {"action": "Radiation Level Measurement", "observation": 591.4885599453094}], "successful": false, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 49, "average_actions": 4.6, "average_tokens": 5549.6, "average_correct": 0.8, "average_parse_error": 0.0, "average_successful_action_num": 4.5, "average_successful_tokens": 5286.5}
