The 'Chemical Contaminant Testing' analysis offers exclusion ranges that can potentially separate these authors, as 'American Lobster' is excluded in a specific concentration range.\n\nHowever, considering the available options, a more definitive step might be to use the 'Acoustic Monitoring' analysis. If 'No Unusual Acoustic Signals' are detected, according to the guidebook, 'Red Drum' would be excluded, leaving 'American Lobster' as the only possibility.\n\nBut since there is a chance to guess, we can take a leap based on available analysis and eliminate possibilities directly. \n\nHowever, considering there are no bases for specific guessing after the elimination of Pacific Oyster, we can proceed to use \"Chemical Contaminant Testing\" for survey purposes instead of guessing \"American Lobster\".\n\nTherefore, the next action we will take is:\n\n<ANSWER> Chemical Contaminant Testing </ANSWER>", "The observation from the 'Chemical Contaminant Testing' shows a concentration of approximately 2.20.
