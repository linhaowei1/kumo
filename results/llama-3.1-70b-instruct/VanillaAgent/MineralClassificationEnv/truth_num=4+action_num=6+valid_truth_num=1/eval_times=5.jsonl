Instead, we now have \"Supply-Side Economics\", \"Neoclassical Economics\", and \"Efficient Market Hypothesis\" still in consideration.\n\nConsidering these remaining mineral types, \"Investigate changes in GDP growth\" seems like a useful next step. GDP growth is a significant indicator that can give insights into the effectiveness of supply-side policies (ruling out \"Supply-Side Economics\" if the growth is outside certain ranges) and the predictions of Neoclassical equilibrium models (potentially challenging \"Neoclassical Economics\" with rapid growth). Meanwhile, it doesn't directly affect \"Efficient Market Hypothesis\" as that's more related to asset price efficiency rather than GDP growth directly, but if GDP growth doesn't reflect market expectations, it could indirectly influence considerations of market efficiency.\n\nTherefore, investigating changes in GDP growth could potentially help narrow down the mineral types by providing more specific, quantifiable results.\n\n<ANSWER> Investigate changes in GDP growth </ANSWER>", "Given the observation that the change in GDP growth is 1.5392931354437267, which falls within the range (0.0, 5.0), none of the mineral types can be ruled out directly based on this result alone according to the guidebook.\n\nHowever, since the task is to systematically reduce the number of possible mineral types, the next step should aim to gather more information that can potentially rule out one or more of the remaining mineral types: \"Supply-Side Economics\", \"Efficient Market Hypothesis\", and \"Neoclassical Economics\".\n\nOne of the less explored avenues is government expenditure's impact on the economy.

If there's no crowding out, it could potentially rule out \"Neoclassical Economics\", as it suggests government spending does not impede private sector activity.\n\nThis experiment does not directly interact with the outcomes that would affect \"Supply-Side Economics\" or \"Efficient Market Hypothesis\" in terms of their respective core assumptions but provides the potential to clarify the applicability of \"Neoclassical Economics\".\n\n<ANSWER> Study government expenditure impacts </ANSWER>", "Given the observation that there is \"No crowding out\" from the government expenditure impacts study, we can rule out \"Neoclassical Economics\" since government spending does not impede private sector activity, challenging Neoclassical views.\n\nNow, we are left with \"Supply-Side Economics\" and \"Efficient Market Hypothesis\".
