Thus, it's best to use another analysis method to narrow down further.\n\nSince the guide does not provide clear distinctions based on tempo alone for the remaining genres, moving to analyze 'Lyrical Content Review' might provide more insight into narrowing down the genres.

However, it might not provide immediate distinctions between Rock, Swing, and Afrobeat without additional context.\n\nConsidering the remaining options, 'Instrumentation Examination' could be particularly useful, as it has the potential to quickly distinguish between genres based on their characteristic instrumentation (e.g., brass instruments for Swing, electric instruments for Rock, jazz and samba elements for Bossa Nova, and a blend of Western and Latin American instruments for Afrobeat).\n\nTherefore, my chosen action for this round would be 'Instrumentation Examination', which could help eliminate at least one or two genres from the list based on observed instrumentation styles.\n\n<ANSWER> Instrumentation Examination </ANSWER>", "The observation from the 'Instrumentation Examination' indicates that the instrumentation used in the song is 'Acoustic'.
