This can potentially differentiate the Crescent from the other irregular patterns or Sphere given its specific 'convex' nature. It's a good technique for finding minimal lines of symmetry.\n\n<ANSWER> Symmetry Tests </ANSWER>", "Given the observation of 'Multiple Lines of Symmetry', this tells us a lot about the potential shape and structure of the constellation. Based on our initial constellation list:\n\n- Irregular Quadrilaterals do not typically exhibit multiple lines of symmetry due to their irregular nature.\n- Crescent can have one line of symmetry but not multiple, due to its curved and convex shape.\n- Circle and Sphere both exhibit perfect symmetry with multiple lines of symmetry.\n\nThe presence of 'Multiple Lines of Symmetry' significantly narrows down our options. Since Circle and Sphere are the most likely candidates given this observation, the next step is to differentiate between these two.\n\nConsidering the techniques available, 'Number of Sides Test' has already been performed, and 'Symmetry Tests' has given us useful information. The 'Convexity Test' could be useful in distinguishing between Circle and Sphere, as a sphere would be convex from all angles.\n\nHowever, a more direct approach to distinguishing between Circle and Sphere is the 'Curvature Test'. This test can help identify whether the constellation is curved but flat (Circle) or fully three-dimensional (Sphere).\n\n<ANSWER> Curvature Test </ANSWER>", "Given the observation of 'No curvature' from the 'Curvature Test', this result seems contradictory to our previous conclusions based on the presence of 'Multiple Lines of Symmetry'.
