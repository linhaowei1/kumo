'Handwriting Analysis' is more straightforward and can quickly eliminate the 'Handwriting' ability from the list if the results are 'Legible and Neat' or 'Legible'.\n\nIf 'Handwriting' is not neat, this could give us clues that the 'Insufficient' rating came from time limits and problems getting ideas to the paper; ultimately resulting in less substance written down and therefore ranked as Insufficient.\n\n<ANSWER> Handwriting Analysis </ANSWER>", "Based on the observation from the 'Handwriting Analysis', which was 'Legible and Neat', we can rule out the lack of 'Handwriting' ability. \n\nHowever, we still need to determine which ability is lacking.
