Deadbeat Control generally aims for minimal overshoot, while Optimal Control may exhibit some overshoot depending on the specific optimization criteria.\n\n<ANSWER> Overshoot Measurement </ANSWER> \n\n", "Reason: The observed overshoot of 60.34 falls within the \"Overshoot (20, 100)\" range. According to the guide, both Optimal Control and Robust Control should be ruled out for this range. Since we already ruled out Robust Control, this leaves us with Deadbeat Control as the only plausible option.\n\n<ANSWER> Deadbeat Control </ANSWER> \n"], "consumed_tokens": 7504, "observations": [null, {"action": "Control Effort Analysis", "observation": 6.3044371862782835}, {"action": "Delay Tolerance Test", "observation": "Delay Tolerant"}, {"action": "Zero Dynamics Analysis", "observation": "Non-minimum Phase"}, {"action": "Overshoot Measurement", "observation": 60.3423310632522}], "successful": true, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 49, "average_actions": 4.0, "average_tokens": 4246.2, "average_correct": 0.6, "average_parse_error": 0.0, "average_successful_action_num": 4.0, "average_successful_tokens": 4259.333333333333}
