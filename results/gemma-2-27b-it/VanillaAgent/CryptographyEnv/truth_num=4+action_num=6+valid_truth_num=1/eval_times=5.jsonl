The Caesar cipher is eliminated as it exhibits a simple shift, not substitution patterns. \n\nLet's further investigate using Key Pattern Testing to see if there are discernible patterns related to key usage.\n\n<ANSWER> Key pattern testing </ANSWER> \n\n\n\n", "A key pattern score of 86.59 indicates a substantial pattern in the key usage. This strongly suggests the cipher is not the ElGamal cipher (which generally has scores from 51 to 100).\n\nLet's eliminate ElGamal cipher and proceed with Key Length Estimation to further distinguish between the remaining ciphers.\n\n<ANSWER> Key length estimation </ANSWER> \n\n", "A key length of 330.41 is not typical for either the Caesar Cipher or the Columnar Transposition cipher, which often use much shorter keys. Considering the previous observations about substitution patterns and key pattern presence, the McEliece cipher is a strong contender. \n\nLet's proceed with Error Analysis to confirm if the characteristics we've observed align with McEliece.\n\n<ANSWER> Error analysis </ANSWER> \n\n\n", "The observation that \"Error propagates significantly\" is consistent with the McEliece cipher, which is designed to resist error introduction. \n\nLet's solidify our analysis.\n\n<ANSWER> McEliece cipher </ANSWER> \n"], "consumed_tokens": 7938, "observations": [null, {"action": "Frequency analysis", "observation": "Frequencies indicate substitution patterns"}, {"action": "Key pattern testing", "observation": 86.59703119666436}, {"action": "Key length estimation", "observation": 330.4144712733438}, {"action": "Error analysis", "observation": "Error propagates significantly"}], "successful": false, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 49, "average_actions": 4.0, "average_tokens": 4420.0, "average_correct": 0.0, "average_parse_error": 0.0, "average_successful_action_num": 0, "average_successful_tokens": 0}
