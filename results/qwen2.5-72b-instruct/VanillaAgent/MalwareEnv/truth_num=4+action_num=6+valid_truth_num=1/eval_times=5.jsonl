'Email Header Analysis' is a good initial choice because it can quickly identify if the malware is an Email Worm by looking for malicious emails or spoofed senders.\n\n<ANSWER> Email Header Analysis </ANSWER>", "Since the Email Header Analysis did not detect any malicious emails, we can rule out the Email Worm. Now, we need to further narrow down the remaining possibilities: Keylogger, Adware, and Rootkit.\n\nNext, let's use 'Machine Learning Classification' to see if we can get a risk score that might help us eliminate more options.\n\n<ANSWER> Machine Learning Classification </ANSWER>", "The high risk score from the Machine Learning Classification suggests that the malware is likely to be either a Keylogger or a Rootkit, as it excludes Adware.\n\nTo further narrow it down, let's perform 'Hook Detection' to see if there are any system or API hooks, which can help us distinguish between Keylogger and Rootkit.\n\n<ANSWER> Hook Detection </ANSWER>", "The detection of system hooks further confirms that the malware is not a Rootkit, as Rootkit was excluded by the high risk score from the Machine Learning Classification.
