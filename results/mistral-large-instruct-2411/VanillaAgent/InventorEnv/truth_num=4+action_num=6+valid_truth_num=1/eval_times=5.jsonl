If the prototype faced peer rejection, it could indicate that Nikola Tesla, who often faced such challenges, might be the inventor. However, if there is no evidence of peer rejection, it won't exclude any inventors but might provide additional context.\n\nAnother useful step could be Data Mining. If the data is poor or insufficient, it could suggest that the prototype is not well-documented, which might be more characteristic of Tesla's later, less funded projects.\n\nAlternatively, Social Media Analysis could help determine if there is any modern discourse about the prototype, which might be more likely if the inventor is someone from the more recent past.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's proceed with Data Mining to see if the available data can provide more insights.\n\n<ANSWER> Data Mining </ANSWER>", " Based on the observations so far:\n\n1.

Data Mining revealed that the data is rich, suggesting comprehensive documentation, which might be less typical of Tesla's later projects but also possible if the prototype was well-documented.\n\nGiven these points, we need to distinguish between Nikola Tesla and Nikolaus Otto. Since the data is rich, it suggests that the prototype might be well-documented, which could be indicative of a more systematic approach typical of Otto's work. Additionally, Tesla's later projects often faced funding issues and might not have such comprehensive documentation.\n\nTherefore, a reasonable next step would be to perform Reverse Engineering to understand the prototype's mechanics.
