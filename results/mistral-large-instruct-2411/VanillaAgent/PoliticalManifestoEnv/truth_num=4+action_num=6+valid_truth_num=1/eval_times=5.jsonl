Here's why:\n\n- Futurism is typically not opposed to globalization, as it sees it as a means to spread technological advancements and innovation.\n- Isolationism, on the other hand, advocates for self-sufficiency, minimal foreign influence, and often restricts global trade and international relations to preserve national interests.\n\nTherefore, based on the promotions of technological progress and the anti-globalization stance observed, the political ideology underpinning the manifesto is Isolationism.\n\n<ANSWER> Isolationism </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 5056, "observations": [null, {"action": "Technological Advancement Analysis", "observation": "Promotion of Tech Progress"}, {"action": "Globalization Stance Analysis", "observation": "Anti-Globalization"}], "successful": true, "parse_error": false}, {"actions": ["Technological Advancement Analysis", "International Cooperation Analysis", "Immigration Policy Analysis", "Isolationism", {"predicted_truth": "Isolationism"}], "generated_text": [" To narrow down the possible political ideologies efficiently, let's consider which methodologies might provide the most immediate and clear exclusions.\n\nGiven the initial list of political ideologies:\n1.
