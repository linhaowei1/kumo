However, since the Sporesheet Test cannot rule out any plants, the Luminescence Test looks more promising. A result of Bright Glow would eliminate Spirit Bloom; any other result would leave two possibilities. Similarly, the Solubility Test could eliminate Earthroot, leaving two possibilities. Given the lack of elimination from the pH Test or the Sporesheet Test and that the Spectral Imaging and Arcane Resonance Frequency have already been utilized, the most sensible next step appears to be a toss-up between Luminescence and Solubility. If the Luminescence test yields a non-bright Glow, two options will remain.\n\nThus the most optimal between these choices is:\n\n<ANSWER> Solubility Test </ANSWER>", " Based on the observation from the Solubility Test, which yielded a solubility of 23.02981085866311%, we can rule out Earthroot.
