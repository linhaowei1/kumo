However, the Cooling System Efficiency Test can specifically target the Rotary (Wankel) Engine, which is a unique engine type among the options.

This result does not exclude any engine types based on the cooling system efficiency alone. Therefore, we need to proceed with another test to gather more information.\n\nGiven the current options, let's consider the next most informative test. The **Fuel Consumption Testing** can provide a wide range of exclusions based on the consumption levels. This test can help exclude the Rotary (Wankel) Engine and/or the Petrol Engine, making it a good choice for our next step.\n\n<ANSWER> Fuel Consumption Testing </ANSWER>", " The observed fuel consumption is approximately 79.1 L/100km, which falls within the range of 15.0 to 100.0 L/100km.

To determine the exact engine type, we can perform one more test that differentiates between these two engines. The **Start-Stop System Test** can be informative, but it might not definitively exclude one of these engines.\n\nInstead, let's consider the **Electric Range Test**. If the vehicle has an electric drivetrain, this test can provide useful information:\n\n- If the electric range is between 0.0 km and 50.0 km, it would exclude the Rotary (Wankel) Engine.\n- If the electric range is between 50.0 km and 100.0 km, it would not exclude any engine types.\n- If the electric range is between 100.0 km and 1000.0 km, it would not exclude any engine types.\n\nGiven that the Rotary (Wankel) Engine is known for higher emissions and lower thermal efficiency, it is less likely to be used in a hybrid or electric vehicle setup.

If the detected fuel type is Petrol, - we still cannot differentiate between the two petrol engine types. If the outcome is not petrol, we can make a definitive prediction.\n\n<ANSWER> Fuel Type Detection </ANSWER>", "  Given the observation from the **Fuel Type Detection** test, the detected fuel type is **Petrol**. This outcome does not rule out any of the remaining engine types (**Petrol Engine**, **Petrol Engine - Inline 4-cylinder**, **Bi-Fuel Engine**) since all of them can operate on petrol. However, it confirms that the engine must be one of these three types.\n\nTo differentiate between the remaining engine types, we need to select a test that can provide more specific information.\n\n1. **Alternative Fuel Compatibility Test**: This test can rule out **Petrol Engine** and **Bi-Fuel Engine** if the engine is compatible with alternative fuels. However, it does not definitively exclude the bi-fuel engine if incompatible, and would not help differentiate between the Petrol variants.\n\n2. **Torque Measurement**: This test can rule out **Petrol Engine** if the torque is between 150.0 and 300.0 or 300.0 and 1000.0. While useful, it does not provide as broad exclusions as some other tests.\n\n3. **Electric Consumption Test**: This test can potentially rule out **Petrol Engine** if the consumption is between 0.0 and 15.0 or 15.0 and 30.0. But, it will not help us differentiate between the inline-4 variant.\n\n4. **Cylinder Deactivation Test**: This test can rule out **Petrol Engine** if cylinder deactivation is inactive. However, it does not provide as broad exclusions as some other tests.\n\n5. **Alternative Fuel Compatibility Test**: I previously excluded this test, but, it occurs to me that the car is known to use Petrol. As a general rule, we should always keep Bi-Fuel engines as an option when we encounter a Petrol Fuel-Type until disproven. Therefore, we should check the Alternative Fuel possibilities before proceeding further.\n\nThe most definitive test at this point would be the **Alternative Fuel Compatibility Test**. If the engine is compatible with alternative fuels, we can rule out the **Petrol Engine** and **Petrol Engine - Inline 4-cylinder**, leaving only the **Bi-Fuel Engine**. If the engine is not compatible with alternative fuels, we can rule out the **Bi-Fuel Engine**, leaving only the Petrol variants remaining.\n\nWe should also keep in mind that earlier we only excluded the Diesel-Electric hybrid and must still differentiate between the Inline 4-Cylinder and Standard Petrol Options.\n\n<ANSWER> Alternative Fuel Compatibility Test </ANSWER>", " Based on the observation from the **Alternative Fuel Compatibility Test**, the engine is compatible with alternative fuels.
