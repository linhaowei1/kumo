A useful method at this stage is \"Thermal pollution measurement.\" This method can help us determine if thermal pollution from power plants is the source by measuring temperature changes in water bodies. If the temperature increase is between 0 to 5 degrees Celsius, we can rule out thermal pollution from power plants. If the temperature increase is between 5 to 30 degrees Celsius, it suggests that thermal pollution from power plants could be a source, but it doesn't rule out other sources.\n\n<ANSWER>Thermal pollution measurement</ANSWER>", " The observation from the \"Thermal pollution measurement\" shows a temperature increase of approximately 0.77 degrees Celsius, which is within the range of 0 to 5 degrees Celsius. This finding allows us to rule out \"Thermal pollution from power plants\" as the source of pollution. We are now left with the following potential sources:\n\n- Pesticide overuse\n- Urban stormwater runoff\n\nTo differentiate between these two sources, we can use the \"Vegetation health assessment\" method. This method can provide insights into the health of vegetation, which can be affected differently by pesticide overuse and urban stormwater runoff.
