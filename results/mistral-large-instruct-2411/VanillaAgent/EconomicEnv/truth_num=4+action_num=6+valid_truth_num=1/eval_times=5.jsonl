More reliable options exist on the list.\n\n4. **Study Trade Balance Changes**: It may be a more viable and clear-cut method to rule out Keynesian Economics given that the range (-10.0,-1.0) is a clearer case for elimination.\n\n5. **Examine Velocity of Money**: As with other simulations, certain outcomes signify only which other models could be ruled out by more reliable tests so this would be a back choice.\n\nConsidering our next logical step after eliminating the Efficient Market Hypothesis,\n\nAmong the above options,\n\n- **Study Effects on Healthcare Systems** and **Study Trade Balance Changes** emerge as the more prominent choices.
