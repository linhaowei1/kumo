This rules out the \"Isosceles Triangle\" constellation, as it does not have all angles equal.\n\n### Remaining Constellations:\n- ['Large Cube', 'Regular Polygon']\n\n### Next Step:\n\nTo distinguish between 'Large Cube' and 'Regular Polygon', we can use two clear tests:\n- The **Number of Sides Test** (Polygons will have a definitive number of sides whereas a cube would have faces instead)\n- or the **Side Length Measurement** (Polygon will have equal sides, but a cube won’t have “sides” in the traditional 2-D geometric sense).\n\nGiven the geometric distinction and the observational possibilities, the **Number of Sides Test** is likely the more reliable method to effectively narrow down our options and eliminate ambiguity. Let's verify this.\n\n <ANSWER> Number of Sides Test </ANSWER>", " Given the observation from the **Number of Sides Test**, the constellation has 1 side. This observation is unusual because typical geometric shapes (like polygons or cubes) would not have just one side. However, given the context and the remaining options, we can infer the following:\n\n- A 'Regular Polygon' would have multiple sides.\n- A 'Large Cube' does not have \"sides\" in the traditional 2D geometric sense; it has faces.\n\nGiven this observation, it's clear that neither a 'Regular Polygon' nor a 'Large Cube' fits the description of having just one side. However, the observation might be indicative of a misunderstanding or a unique interpretation of the shape.\n\n### Logical Conclusion:\n\nSince the observation of having just one side does not fit the traditional definitions of the remaining constellations, and considering the previous exclusions, the most plausible interpretation is that the observation might be a misinterpretation or a unique aspect of the 'Large Cube'.
