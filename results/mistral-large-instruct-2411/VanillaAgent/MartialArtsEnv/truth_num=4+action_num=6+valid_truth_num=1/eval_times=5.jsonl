This leaves us with Silat and Sumo.\n\nTo differentiate between Silat and Sumo, we can use the **Weapon Usage Observation**. Silat is known for its use of weapons, while Sumo does not use weapons. This should give us a clear indication of which style we are observing.\n\n<ANSWER> Weapon Usage Observation </ANSWER>", " Given the observation of \"Weaponless Techniques,\" we can exclude Silat, as it is known for its use of weapons. This leaves us with Sumo.\n\nTo confirm if the style is Sumo, we can use the **Balance Stability Test**. Sumo is known for its exceptional balance and stability. A high score in this test would strongly indicate Sumo.\n\n<ANSWER> Balance Stability Test </ANSWER>", " Based on the observations so far:\n\n- **Occasional Vocalization**: This excludes Taekwondo and Karate.\n- **Weaponless Techniques**: This excludes Silat.\n- **Balance Stability Test**: The score of 68.91331155883485 is relatively high but not exceptionally high (80-100), which aligns with Sumo, as Sumo focuses on balance but might not score as high as styles purely focused on agility and precision.\n\nGiven these observations, the remaining style that fits all the criteria is Sumo. Therefore, we can confidently predict that the martial arts style is Sumo.\n\n<ANSWER> Sumo </ANSWER>"], "consumed_tokens": 6968, "observations": [null, {"action": "Vocalization Usage Observation", "observation": "Occasional Vocalization"}, {"action": "Weapon Usage Observation", "observation": "Weaponless Techniques"}, {"action": "Balance Stability Test", "observation": 68.91331155883485}], "successful": false, "parse_error": false}], "seed": 49, "average_actions": 4.2, "average_tokens": 5686.4, "average_correct": 0.0, "average_parse_error": 0.0, "average_successful_action_num": 0, "average_successful_tokens": 0}
