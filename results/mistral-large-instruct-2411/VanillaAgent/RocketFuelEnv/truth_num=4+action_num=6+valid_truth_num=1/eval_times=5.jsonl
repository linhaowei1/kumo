However, to be certain, we should perform another experiment to confirm our findings.\n\nThe **Emission of Toxic Gases Measurement** could be a good next step.

Let's consider the available experiments and their outcomes:\n\n1. **Exhaust Plume Spectroscopy**:\n   - High water vapor detected: Rule out Hydrogen Fluoride (HF).\n   - Metallic particles detected: Rule out Liquid Ethanol, Liquid Propane (LPG), and Liquid Ethane.\n\n2. **Density Measurement of Fuel**:\n   - Density between 800 and 1000: Rule out Liquid Ethanol and Liquid Ethane.\n   - Density between 70 and 80: Rule out Liquid Propane (LPG).\n\n3. **Soot Particle Detection**:\n   - No soot detected: Rule out Liquid Propane (LPG) and Liquid Ethane.\n\n4. **Fuel Freezing Point Measurement**:\n   - Freezing point between 50 and 100: Rule out Liquid Propane (LPG).\n   - Freezing point between 250 and 300: No fuels to rule out.\n\n5. **Fuel Odor Analysis**:\n   - Pungent odor: Rule out Liquid Propane (LPG).\n   - Odorless: No fuels to rule out.\n\n6. **Flame Color Observation**:\n   - Green flame: Rule out Liquid Propane (LPG).\n\nGiven these options, **Exhaust Plume Spectroscopy** and **Soot Particle Detection** seem promising as they can eliminate multiple fuels depending on the outcome.
