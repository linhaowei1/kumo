It's a useful method but only rules out one specific author.\n\n4. **Plankton Net Sampling**: This method can rule out \"Warty Comb Jelly\" if normal plankton levels are observed. It's a straightforward method to eliminate one author.\n\n5. **Temperature Anomaly Detection**: This method can rule out \"Sea Lamprey\" if the anomaly range is between 2.0 and 5.0.
