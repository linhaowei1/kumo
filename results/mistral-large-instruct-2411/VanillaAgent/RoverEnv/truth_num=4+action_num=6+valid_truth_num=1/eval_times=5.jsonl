This result does not rule out any rover prototypes, as all rovers remain potential candidates when the instruments are calibrated.\n\nNext, we should consider another test that can rule out multiple prototypes or provide clear distinctions. The \"Environmental Sensor Test\" can rule out Rover Meteor if the sensors are malfunctioning. However, if the sensors are functional, no rovers are ruled out.\n\nAnother effective test is the \"Camera Resolution Test,\" which can rule out specific rovers based on the resolution observed:\n\n- **Medium Resolution**: Rules out Rover Endeavor.\n- **High Resolution**: Rules out Rover Zenith.\n\nGiven that the \"Camera Resolution Test\" can provide clear distinctions, it is a strategic choice at this stage.\n\n<ANSWER> Camera Resolution Test </ANSWER>", " The observation from the \"Camera Resolution Test\" indicates high resolution, which rules out Rover Zenith. This leaves us with the following potential rovers:\n\n- Rover Endeavor\n- Rover Meteor\n- Rover Neptune III\n\nNext, we should select a test that can further narrow down our options. The \"Wheel Traction Test\" can rule out Rover Endeavor if the traction falls within the 40-70 range. However, if the traction is outside this range, no rovers are ruled out.\n\nAnother effective test is the \"Lidar Calibration Test,\" which can rule out Rover Meteor if calibration is needed.
