Below is a review of each:\n\n**Phoenix Fire Trial** - This method would rule out one option but has two potential outcomes that would not reduce the remaining items in any way, meaning it would leave you with a 66% chance of non-elimination.\n\n**Time-Lost Archive Reading** - More promising since it would rule out an artefact of a similar number of items closer but with it has arguably a 33% chance to rule out as opposed to the sureshot *previous* suggestion.\n\n### Plan of Action:\n\nThe **Portal Snapshot** has a couple of potential answers, one of which confirms no outcomes, while the other would knock off an option, therefore leaving you with a 66% chance to end up knocking off another item altogether.
