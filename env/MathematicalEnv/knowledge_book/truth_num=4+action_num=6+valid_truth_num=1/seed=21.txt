# Mathematical Guidebook: Theorems and Deduction Methods

This guidebook aims to introduce you to a selection of mathematical theorems and the logical deduction processes we can use to understand and analyze various mathematical situations. We'll explore the following theorems and outline how specific observations during analysis can rule out these theorems. 

## Mathematical Theorems Explained

### 1. Jordan Curve Theorem
The Jordan Curve Theorem tells us that a simple closed curve (like a loop) in a plane divides the plane into an "inside" and "outside" region, each connected. This theorem is crucial when considering the properties and connectivity of planar graphs and closed loops.

### 2. Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem
The Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem states that for any continuous function from a convex compact set to itself in an Euclidean space, there exists a point which remains unchanged under the function. This theorem has implications in various fields, including economics and game theory, in understanding equilibrium states.

### 3. Law of Cosines
The Law of Cosines establishes a relation between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the cosine of one of its angles. It's an extension of the Pythagorean theorem and is particularly useful for solving oblique triangles.

### 4. Fermat's Little Theorem
Fermat's Little Theorem is a fundamental idea in number theory stating that if *p* is a prime number, then for any integer *a* not divisible by *p*, *a* raised to the power of *p-1* is congruent to 1 modulo *p*. This theorem is essential in fields like cryptography.

## Logical Deductions and Theorem-Matching Checks

Logical deductions help us analyze various mathematical properties and ascertain whether specific theorems apply. By observation, particular outcomes can rule out the application of certain theorems. Let's explore these deductions:

### 1. Analyze Geometric Figures
- **No right angles detected**: If no right angles are detected in the analysis of a geometric figure, the **Law of Cosines** can be ruled out as it deals with triangles, often requiring angle analysis to apply fully.
- **Non-planar graph observed**: When observing non-planar graphs, the **Jordan Curve Theorem** can be ruled out since it specifically applies to planar curves.

### 2. Evaluate Trigonometric Identities
- **Trigonometric identity mismatch**: If a trigonometric identity does not hold, we may rule out the **Law of Cosines**, which depends on precise trigonometric relationships in a triangle.

### 3. Assess Number Theoretic Properties
- **Number is not prime**: When dealing with a number that isn't prime, **Fermat's Little Theorem** can be ruled out since its implications hinge on the primality of numbers involved.

### 4. Examine Fixed Points
- **No fixed point exists**: If observing that no fixed point exists for a given function analysis, then the **Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem** is ruled out, as it specifically confirms the existence of such points.

### 5. Analyze Connectivity
This deduction method allows you to analyze whether a graph is connected or disconnected; however, it does not specifically rule out any of the given theorems based on connectivity alone.

### 6. Examine Logical Consistency
- **Proof leads to contradiction**: Identifying inconsistencies or contradictions in proofs can inform deductions broadly but doesn't directly rule out any particular theorems in this context.

By understanding these deduction methods and their related observable outcomes, you'll be able to effectively determine which mathematical theorems are not applicable in a given situation, adding clarity to your analytical processes.
