## Mathematical Guidebook: Understanding Theorems through Natural Language

Welcome to a journey through some intriguing mathematical theorems and logical deduction methods! This guide will introduce you to four mathematically significant theorems, how they can be checked using certain logical processes, and what outcomes can tell us what these theorems aren't applicable to a given situation. Let's dive in!

## Mathematical Theorems

Here are the four key theorems you'll be encountering in this guide:

1. **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**: This theorem states that every non-constant polynomial equation with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. In simpler terms, every polynomial equation has at least one solution in the realm of complex numbers.

2. **Wilson's Theorem**: A famous result in number theory, Wilson’s Theorem asserts that a natural number \(n > 1\) is a prime if and only if \((n-1)! \equiv -1 \ (\text{mod} \ n)\). This theorem provides a condition to identify prime numbers.

3. **Borsuk-Ulam Theorem**: Stemming from topology, it indicates that for any continuous function mapping a sphere to the plane, there are at least two opposite points on the sphere that map to the same point in the plane. It’s a fascinating exploration in bi-dimensional symmetry.

4. **Zorn's Lemma**: A proposition that is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice in set theory. It claims that if every chain (a totally ordered subset) in a set has an upper bound, then the entire set contains at least one maximal element. It’s frequently used in proofs where existence needs to be shown rather than construction.

## Logical Deductions and Theorem Matching Checks

Next, we explore various logical deduction methods and how they help in assessing the relevance or exclusion of the above theorems.

### 1. Analyze Polynomial Roots
- **Number of real roots less than degree**: When analyzing the roots of a polynomial, if we find that the number of real roots is less than its degree, the **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra** must be ruled out as irrelevant to this specific scenario.
  
- **Non-rational roots found**: The analysis here doesn't rule out any of our theorems from the scenario right away.
  
- **Complex roots found**: Similar to non-rational roots, the presence of complex roots does not exclude any theorem directly.

### 2. Examine Fixed Points
- **Fixed point exists**: No ruling out happens here as no specific theorems are explicitly excluded based on a fixed point's existence.
  
- **No fixed point exists**: Should no fixed point exist, we can be certain that the **Borsuk-Ulam Theorem** cannot be applicable to this scenario.

### 3. Examine Logical Consistency
- **Proof leads to contradiction**: If a logical proof leads to a contradiction, then **Zorn's Lemma** is not relevant to the consideration of this proof.
  
- **No contradiction found**: With the absence of contradiction, no theorems are specifically ruled out.

### 4. Assess Number Theoretic Properties
- **Number is not prime**: When a number is assessed and found not to be prime, **Wilson's Theorem** is automatically deemed irrelevant.
  
- **Number is prime**: In a prime number scenario, there's no immediate exclusion of theorems.

### 5. Test for Homeomorphism
- **Space not homeomorphic to sphere**: In this investigation, discovering a space that isn’t homeomorphic to a sphere eliminates the applicability of the **Borsuk-Ulam Theorem**.
  
- **Space is homeomorphic to sphere**: A homeomorphic space does not directly exclude any theorems from consideration.

### 6. Analyze Connectivity
- **Graph is disconnected**: This deduction check does not exclude any specific theorems from relevance.
  
- **Graph is connected**: Similarly, a connected graph doesn't specifically rule out any theorems.

## Conclusion

This guide illustrates how examining mathematical situations using logical deduction can assist in identifying when certain theorems are not applicable. These deduction checks serve as filters, ruling out specific theorems based on the evidence presented by logical outcomes. Thus, understanding and applying these methodologies allows mathematicians to focus on what's applicable, thereby speeding up problem-solving and encouraging deeper mathematical insights.
