# Mathematical Theorem Guidebook

This guidebook aims to introduce several fundamental mathematical theorems and logical deduction methods. By understanding how specific outcomes from deduction checks can exclude certain theorems, you can gain deeper insights into the underlying mathematical concepts. This approach does not confirm the applicability of the theorems but helps in ruling out those that are not relevant.

## Mathematical Theorems

### 1. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects the concept of differentiation with that of integration. It states that if a function is continuous over an interval, the integral of its derivative over that interval is equal to the difference in values of the function at the boundaries of the interval. This theorem helps in calculating definite integrals and understanding the accumulation of quantities.

### 2. Rank-Nullity Theorem
The Rank-Nullity Theorem is a fundamental result in linear algebra that relates the dimensions of a linear transformation's domain to its rank and nullity. The theorem states that for a linear transformation mapping from one vector space to another, the dimension of the domain is the sum of the rank of the transformation and the nullity. This provides insight into the structure of linear maps.

### 3. Spectral Theorem
The Spectral Theorem pertains to linear operators in a vector space. It states that any linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space has an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors. The operator can be represented as a diagonal matrix relative to this basis. This theorem is instrumental in the fields of quantum mechanics and linear algebra.

### 4. Law of Sines
The Law of Sines is a relationship in trigonometry that relates the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides. Specifically, it states that the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of its opposite angle is constant across all three sides and angles of the triangle. This is particularly useful in solving for unknown parts of a triangle when certain other parts are known.

## Logical Deductions / Theorem-Matching Checks

### 1. Assess Integral Relationships
This deduction method involves analyzing the integration properties of functions to understand their applicability with respect to specific theorems.

- **Function not integrable**: When a function is determined to be not integrable, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is ruled out as the theorem relies on the integrability of the function.

### 2. Evaluate Trigonometric Identities
This check involves verifying whether given trigonometric relationships hold true.

- **Trigonometric identity mismatch**: If a particular trigonometric identity does not hold, the Law of Sines is ruled out as it depends on accurate trigonometric relationships.

### 3. Analyze Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
This deduction involves exploring the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a given linear operator.

- **All eigenvalues zero**: When all eigenvalues of a matrix or operator are zero, the Spectral Theorem is ruled out, as the theorem typically involves non-zero eigenvalues for a meaningful spectral decomposition.

### 4. Evaluate Operator Properties
This method involves assessing the linearity or non-linearity of operators.

- **Operator is not linear**: If an operator is shown to be non-linear, the Rank-Nullity Theorem is ruled out as it applies specifically to linear transformations.

### 5. Evaluate Function Continuity
Evaluating the continuity of functions helps to determine the applicability of theorems involving continuous functions.

- **Discontinuities detected**: If discontinuities are detected in a function, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is ruled out as it requires the function to be continuous over the integration interval.

### 6. Evaluate Algebraic Identities
This is the assessment of algebraic identities and their validity.

- **Identity does not hold**: While no specific theorems are ruled out under this deduction in the provided outcomes, this check typically excludes those theorems that depend on the specific identity being verified.

By systematically performing these deductions and interpreting the outcomes, you can effectively rule out theorems that are not applicable, thereby narrowing down the set of possible relevant theorems for further consideration.
