# A Guide to Connecting Theorems with Logical Deductions

This guide explores several significant mathematical theorems and how they can be logically sorted or ruled out through different deduction methods. The deduction process involves analyzing certain aspects or properties of mathematical objects, such as geometric figures, equations, numbers, graphs, and others. By identifying which theorems cannot apply under certain conditions, we are left with a clearer pathway to understanding which theorems might be relevant. Below we outline each theorem and the corresponding logical deductions that aid in ruling out irrelevant theorems.

## Mathematical Theorems

### 1. Wilson's Theorem

Wilson’s Theorem is a statement in number theory which asserts that a natural number \( n > 1 \) is a prime if and only if \((n-1)! \equiv -1 \mod n\). The theorem provides a deep insight into the properties of prime numbers.

### 2. Spectral Theorem

The Spectral Theorem is fundamental in linear algebra and functional analysis. It states that a normal operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space can be diagonalized. For real symmetric matrices, it indicates that they can be orthogonally diagonalized using their eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### 3. Noether's Theorem

Noether’s Theorem reveals the relationship between symmetries and conservation laws in physics. It states that every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system corresponds to a conservation law.

### 4. Kuratowski’s Theorem

Kuratowski’s Theorem addresses graph theory and states that a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of either \( K_5 \) (the complete graph on five vertices) or \( K_{3,3} \) (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices with three vertices in each partition set).

## Logical Deductions and Theorem-Matching Checks

### 1. Analyze Geometric Figures

- **No right angles detected**: No theorems are excluded.
- **No symmetry observed**: No theorems are excluded.
- **Non-planar graph observed**: Kuratowski's Theorem is ruled out.

### 2. Check for Symmetry in Equations

- **Symmetry observed**: No theorems are excluded.
- **No symmetry observed**: Noether's Theorem is ruled out.

### 3. Assess Number Theoretic Properties

- **Number is not prime**: Wilson's Theorem is ruled out.
- **Number is prime**: No theorems are excluded.

### 4. Analyze Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

- **All eigenvalues zero**: The Spectral Theorem is ruled out.
- **Eigenvalues are complex**: No theorems are excluded.

### 5. Analyze Connectivity

- **Graph is disconnected**: Kuratowski's Theorem is ruled out.
- **Graph is connected**: No theorems are excluded.

### 6. Examine Conservation Laws

- **No conserved quantities found**: Noether's Theorem is ruled out.
- **Conserved quantities observed**: No theorems are excluded.

## Application Guidance

By observing the properties or outcomes associated with each deduction method, one can rule out the non-applicable theorems efficiently. This structured approach allows students and researchers to narrow down theorems that are likely applicable in a given mathematical context, facilitating deeper insights and solutions. Use this guide as a reference to quickly assess which theorems can be excluded and thereby focusing attention on the most relevant mathematical concepts in a given analysis.
