# Mathematical Theorem and Deduction Guidebook

In this guidebook, we will explore four key mathematical theorems and six logical deduction methods. We will explain each theorem in simple terms and describe how the outcomes of logical deductions can exclude these theorems as possible explanations or solutions. The goal is to provide clarity on how each deduction method leads to specific exclusions based on observed outcomes.

## Mathematical Theorems

1. **Fermat's Little Theorem**
   - **Description**: Fermat's Little Theorem is a fundamental principle in number theory. It states that if \( p \) is a prime number and \( a \) is an integer not divisible by \( p \), then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \). This theorem is used primarily to assess properties of prime numbers.

2. **Euler's Formula (e^(iπ) + 1 = 0)**
   - **Description**: Euler's Formula is a stunning equation in mathematics, linking five fundamental constants: \( e \), \( i \), \( π \), 1, and 0. It is notable for its beauty and simplicity in connecting exponential growth and trigonometric identities.

3. **Law of Cosines**
   - **Description**: The Law of Cosines generalizes the Pythagorean theorem for any triangle. It expresses the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the cosine of one of its angles: \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cdot \cos(C) \), where \( C \) is the angle opposite side \( c \).

4. **Fubini's Theorem**
   - **Description**: Fubini's Theorem is a key result in calculus, asserting that under certain conditions, the integral of a function over a rectangular region can be computed by iterated integrals. This theorem applies to functions of multiple variables and aids in simplifying complex integrations.

## Logical Deductions and Outcomes

Here, we describe how various logical deductions yield specific outcomes and which theorems are excluded based on these outcomes.

### 1. Assess Integral Relationships

- **Function not integrable**: If a function is determined to be non-integrable, **Fubini's Theorem** is excluded as it presupposes integrability.

- **Non-standard integral paths required**: No exclusions occur under this outcome.

- **Integration yields constant result**: No exclusions occur under this outcome.

### 2. Evaluate Trigonometric Identities

- **Trigonometric identity mismatch**: Here, both the **Law of Cosines** and **Euler's Formula** are excluded due to their reliance on particular trigonometric relationships which might not hold.

- **Identity holds only at specific points**: **Euler's Formula** is excluded, as its identity strictly applies only to particular identities in the complex plane.

- **No trigonometric functions present**: No exclusions occur under this outcome.

### 3. Assess Number Theoretic Properties

- **Number is not prime**: In this case, **Fermat's Little Theorem** is excluded as it specifically applies to prime number scenarios.

- **Number is prime**: No exclusions occur under this outcome.

### 4. Evaluate Algebraic Identities

- **Identity does not hold**: **Euler's Formula** is excluded if the observed identity invalidates the connection the formula makes.

- **Identity holds**: No exclusions occur under this outcome.

### 5. Analyze Measure Properties

- **Set is not measurable**: Here, **Fubini's Theorem** is excluded as it assumes the existence of measurable sets.

- **Set is measurable**: No exclusions occur under this outcome.

### 6. Analyze Geometric Figures

- **No right angles detected**: **Law of Cosines** is excluded if evaluation reveals no right angles, as the theorem helps in assessing non-right angled triangles.

- **No symmetry observed**: No exclusions occur under this outcome.

- **Non-planar graph observed**: No exclusions occur under this outcome.

By understanding these logical deductions and outcomes, you will be better equipped to rule out inapplicable theorems, allowing you to zero in on the most appropriate mathematical principle to apply in your analysis.
