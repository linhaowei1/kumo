## Mathematical Guidebook: Understanding Theorems through Logical Deduction

This guidebook serves to introduce some fundamental theorems in mathematics and the methods of logical deduction that can help us rule out certain theroems based on observed outcomes. Understanding how these theorems can be analyzed through different mathematical properties assists in isolating or excluding possibilities, allowing for deeper insights into mathematical problems.

## Theorems Overview

### 1. Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry, asserting that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse's length equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This relationship is strictly applicable only to right-angled triangles.

### 2. Kuratowski's Theorem
Kuratowski's Theorem addresses the properties of graph structures, specifically non-planar graphs and their ability to be expressed as a subdivision of either K₅ or K₃,₃, which are basic non-planar graphs.

### 3. Fubini's Theorem
Fubini's Theorem is integral in the analysis of multi-dimensional measure and integrability, mainly concerning the exchange of integration order in multiple integrals under certain conditions. It’s applicable where the functions are integrable and the set of integration is measurable.

### 4. Borsuk-Ulam Theorem
The Borsuk-Ulam Theorem states that any continuous function mapping an n-dimensional sphere to n-dimensional space must have a pair of antipodal points mapped to the same point. This theorem highlights properties of spheres and fixed points in topological spaces.

## Deduction Methods and Rule-Out Outcomes

### Analyze Geometric Figures
By analyzing geometric figures, deductions can be made as follows:
- **No right angles detected**: The Pythagorean Theorem is ruled out because it applies specifically to right-angled triangles.
- **Non-planar graph observed**: Kuratowski's Theorem is ruled out since the observation suggests configurations that eliminate the applicability of Kuratowski's criteria for non-planarity.

### Assess Integral Relationships
This involves evaluating functions and integral relationships:
- **Function not integrable**: Any reliance on Fubini's Theorem is excluded since integrability is a prerequisite for its application.
- **Set is not measurable**: Similarly, Fubini's Theorem is ruled out due to non-measurability of the integration set, which is critical.

### Analyze Connectivity
In graph theory, connectivity insights can exclude relevant properties:
- **Graph is disconnected**: Kuratowski's Theorem is ruled out as the graph's disconnection excludes the applicability of Kuratowski's criteria for non-planarity.
- **Graph is connected**: This outcome doesn't specifically result in any exclusions but sets the stage for further analysis.

### Test for Homeomorphism
Topology and related spatial properties can be deduced through homeomorphism testing:
- **Space not homeomorphic to sphere**: Borsuk-Ulam Theorem is ruled out since it relies on the premise of spherical topology.

### Examine Fixed Points
Analyzing potential fixed points can guide theorem exclusions:
- **No fixed point exists**: Borsuk-Ulam Theorem is ruled out as its governing principle is the existence of such fixed (antipodal) points.

### Analyze Measure Properties
Understanding the properties of mathematical measures assists in theorem evaluation:
- **Set is not measurable**: This excludes Fubini's Theorem since measurability is necessary for applying integrability transitions.

By using the methods outlined above, strategic deductive analysis allows us to systematically rule out (exclude) certain theorems under observed conditions. This exclusion path aids in focusing on viable mathematical theories and enhances problem-solving efficiency.
