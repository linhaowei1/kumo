# A Guide to Theorems and Deductions

In the realm of mathematics, understanding the foundational theorems and the logical deduction methods is crucial. This guide aims to provide clear explanations of several fundamental theorems and the logical deductions used to evaluate these theorems. Furthermore, we'll outline the conditions under which certain theorems can be excluded from consideration when specific outcomes are observed.

## Mathematical Theorems

### 1. Residue Theorem
The Residue Theorem is essential in complex analysis and provides a powerful tool for evaluating line integrals of analytic functions over closed curves. This theorem takes advantage of singularities (poles) inside a given curve, allowing the computation of integrals by evaluating the residues at these poles.

### 2. Cantor's Theorem
Cantor's Theorem deals with the concept of cardinality, which is the measure of the "size" of a set. The theorem states that the set of all subsets of a given set (the power set) has a strictly greater cardinality than the set itself, demonstrating that there are different sizes of infinity.

### 3. Stokes' Theorem
Stokes' Theorem provides a relationship between the surface integral of a vector field over a surface and the line integral over its boundary. This theorem is a generalization of several fundamental theorems in calculus, including Green's Theorem and the Divergence Theorem.

### 4. Green's Theorem
Green's Theorem establishes a relationship between a line integral around a simple, closed curve and a double integral over the plane region bounded by the curve. It is a special case of Stokes' Theorem applied to two-dimensional vector fields.

## Logical Deductions / Theorem-Matching Checks

### 1. Assess Integral Relationships
This check involves examining the integrability of functions and the paths along which integration is performed. It can lead to excluding:
- **Green's Theorem** and **Stokes' Theorem** if the function is not integrable.
- **Residue Theorem** if non-standard integral paths are required (the theorem typically handles standard closed paths).

### 2. Check for Integration Paths
The path of integration can influence the applicability of certain theorems:
- Exclude **Green's Theorem** and **Stokes' Theorem** if the integration path is not closed.

### 3. Examine Cardinality
By assessing the cardinality of sets, one can determine the applicability of certain set-related theorems:
- Exclude **Cantor's Theorem** if the set is countable.

### 4. Examine Limit Behaviors
This deduction involves analyzing the behavior of functions as they approach a limit:
- No exclusions are explicitly defined here based on the provided outcomes.

### 5. Analyze Polynomial Roots
Evaluating the roots of polynomials helps in understanding their structure and solutions:
- No exclusions are explicitly defined here based on the provided outcomes.

### 6. Evaluate Function Continuity
This check involves evaluating whether a function is continuous over its domain:
- No exclusions are explicitly defined here based on the provided outcomes.

## Conclusion

This guide serves as an introduction to understanding the relationship between key mathematical theorems and various deduction methods. By observing the outcomes of these deductions, we can determine which theorems are applicable or need to be ruled out under given conditions. These logical checks ensure a structured approach to applying the appropriate mathematical tools to different problems.
