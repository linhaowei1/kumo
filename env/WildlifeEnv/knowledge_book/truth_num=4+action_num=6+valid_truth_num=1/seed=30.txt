### Wildlife Conservation Strategy Guide

**Introduction to Endangered Species**

In the world of wildlife conservation, some species demand our attention because of their endangered status. Among these are:

1. **Grevy's Zebra**: Known for their striking narrow stripes and large size, Grevyâ€™s Zebras are native to Kenya and Ethiopia. They are the most threatened of the three species of zebra, primarily due to habitat loss and competition with livestock for resources.

2. **Black-Footed Ferret**: This small, carnivorous mammal native to North America was once considered extinct in the wild. Black-footed ferrets depend on prairie dog colonies for food and shelter, which have drastically diminished.

3. **Bornean Orangutan**: Native to the island of Borneo, these great apes have experienced severe population declines due to deforestation and hunting. The Bornean orangutan has distinct facial features and a shaggy red coat.

4. **Saola**: Often referred to as the "Asian unicorn" due to its rarity and elusiveness, the Saola is found in the Annamite Range of Vietnam and Laos. Little is known about this species, which faces threats from habitat loss and poaching.

**Wildlife Survey Methods**

When conserving wildlife, it's essential to understand how to effectively monitor and study these animals. Several survey methods are widely used, each applicable in specific contexts:

1. **Aerial Surveys**: This method involves observing wildlife from an aircraft to cover large areas quickly. However, aerial surveys are not effective for all species:
   - If no large herds are observed during aerial surveys, exclude Grevy's Zebra and Saola as possibilities because they tend to form noticeable groups.

2. **Baited Hair Traps**: These traps collect hair samples from wildlife, providing DNA for species identification.
   - If there is no primate hair found in these traps, the Bornean Orangutan would be ruled out, as DNA samples would not indicate their presence.

3. **Line Transects**: This manual survey method involves observers walking along a line and recording sightings of animals.
   - If no ungulates (hoofed animals) are detected during such surveys, Saola should be excluded since they fall into this category.

4. **Footprint Analysis**: By studying footprints in their natural habitats, we can deduce animal presence and population.
   - If footprint sizes are between 5 and 15 cm, Black-Footed Ferrets should be excluded due to their much smaller paw size.

5. **Scat Analysis**: This involves the study of animal feces to infer diet and health and confirm species.
   - If scat density is between 1 and 5 pieces per unit area, it could mean ruling out Black-Footed Ferret sightings, as their scat is less commonly encountered this way.

6. **Remote Sensing**: Satellite technology and aerial imagery help monitor environmental changes.
   - If no deforestation is detected in a particular area, this might mean Bornean Orangutans are not present, considering their reliance on forested habitats.

**Conclusion**

In wildlife conservation, understanding which species must be considered or excluded based on the findings of various surveys is crucial for planning and executing effective conservation strategies. The above survey methods allow researchers to narrow down possibilities and understand the habitats and presence of endangered species like Grevy's Zebra, Black-Footed Ferret, Bornean Orangutan, and Saola. By effectively applying these exclusion criteria, conservationists can better allocate resources to safeguard these remarkable yet vulnerable species.
