# Wildlife Conservation Strategy Guide

## Introduction

This guide focuses on the conservation of certain endangered species and describes wildlife survey methods that help monitor their populations. Here, we concentrate on four critically endangered animal species: the Island Fox, Bornean Orangutan, Black Spider Monkey, and Bonobo. We will also outline several wildlife survey methods used to track these species, highlighting specific criteria that allow for the exclusion, or ruling out, of these animals based on particular observations.

## Endangered Animal Species

1. **Island Fox**
   - A small fox native to the Channel Islands of California, they are known for their distinctive characteristics and are critically endangered due to factors like diseases and habitat loss.

2. **Bornean Orangutan**
   - Found in the forests of Borneo, these great apes are arboreal and face severe threats from deforestation and habitat destruction.

3. **Black Spider Monkey**
   - Native to the tropical forests of South America, this primate species is heavily reliant on tree canopies and is endangered due to habitat fragmentation.

4. **Bonobo**
   - Found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, bonobos are our closest relatives along with the chimpanzees and face threats from hunting and habitat loss.

## Wildlife Survey Methods and Exclusion Criteria

Each survey method has specific exclusion criteria which help in eliminating potential species based on observations made.

### 1. Footprint Analysis

- **Method Overview**: This involves identifying and analyzing animal footprints left in their habitat to determine presence and population sizes.

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - **Distance (0 to 5 km)**: No species are excluded.
  - **Distance (5 to 15 km)**: The Island Fox is excluded.
  - **Distance (15 to 50 km)**: No species are excluded.
  - **Distance (50 to 4000 km)**: No species are excluded.

### 2. Remote Sensing

- **Method Overview**: Use of satellite imagery and aerial photography to monitor habitat changes and land use.

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - **No Deforestation Detected**: Bornean Orangutan is excluded due to their reliance on forest environments.
  - **No Habitat Loss Observed**: No species are excluded.

### 3. Line Transects

- **Method Overview**: Involves observers walking along a line in the habitat to record sightings of animals, which helps estimate population density.

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - **No Ungulates Detected**: No species are excluded.
  - **No Primates Observed**: Bonobo is excluded as it is a primate.

### 4. Roadkill Surveys

- **Method Overview**: Identifying and analyzing roadkill to determine affected species and estimate population impacts. 

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - **No Roadkills Found**: Island Fox is excluded if no roadkill is detected.
  - **No Mammalian Carcasses**: No species are excluded.

### 5. Scat Analysis

- **Method Overview**: Collecting and examining animal feces to identify presence, diet, and health of species.

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - **Quantity (0 to 1 scat)**: No species are excluded.
  - **Quantity (1 to 5 scats)**: Island Fox is excluded.
  - **Quantity (5 to 20 scats)**: No species are excluded.
  - **Quantity (20 to 100 scats)**: No species are excluded.
  - **Quantity (100 to 5000 scats)**: No species are excluded.

### 6. Baited Hair Traps

- **Method Overview**: Traps are used to collect hair samples from animals, which, when analyzed, help identify individual species presence.

- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - **No Primate Hair Found**: Black Spider Monkey and Bornean Orangutan are excluded when no primate hair is detected.
  - **No Bear Hair Detected**: No species are excluded.

## Conclusion

The effective conservation of these endangered species depends on accurate monitoring and data collection through various survey methods. Understanding and applying the exclusion criteria correctly ensures that conservation efforts are focused where they are most needed, helping us to protect and preserve these invaluable species for future generations.
