# Wildlife Conservation Strategy Guide for Endangered Species

The aim of this guide is to provide a comprehensive approach to wildlife conservation by detailing the endangered species we're focusing on and the methods used to survey them. In addition, we highlight specific scenarios under which certain species are ruled out from being identified or tracked using particular survey methods, based on predefined exclusion criteria.

## Endangered Animal Species

1. **African Wild Dog**  
   The African Wild Dog is recognized for its unique coat pattern and social structure. It faces threats from habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.

2. **Philippine Eagle**  
   Known as one of the largest and most powerful birds of prey, this eagle is native to the Philippines and is threatened by deforestation and severe habitat loss.

3. **Rhinos**  
   Rhinos, including black, white, and Javan species, are primarily threatened by poaching for their horns and habitat destruction.

4. **Amur Leopard**  
   With its beautiful spotted coat, the Amur Leopard is one of the rarest big cats in the world, mainly found in Russia and China, suffering from poaching and habitat loss.

## Wildlife Survey Methods

1. **Thermal Imaging**  
   This method uses heat signatures to detect animals. It is effective in locating creatures at night or in dense foliage.

   - **Exclusion Rule**: If no large heat signatures are observed, **Rhinos** are ruled out from detection.

2. **Radio Telemetry**  
   This involves using radio signals to track animals fitted with collars or tags.

   - **Exclusion Rule**: If no signals are received, it rules out **Amur Leopard**. Additionally, if no bird frequencies are detected, the **Philippine Eagle** is excluded.

3. **Nest Surveillance**  
   This method involves monitoring nests to study and conserve bird populations.

   - **Exclusion Rule**: Absence of bird nests leads to ruling out the **Philippine Eagle**.

4. **DNA Sampling**  
   Collecting and analyzing DNA from the environment (e.g., footprints, feces) to identify species.

   - **Exclusion Rule**: If there’s no felidae DNA detected, **Amur Leopard** is ruled out.

5. **Lure Cameras**  
   Cameras deployed with bait to attract and photograph elusive wildlife.

   - **Exclusion Rule**: No carnivores being lured results in **Amur Leopard** being ruled out from presence in the area.

6. **Satellite Tracking**  
   Using satellite technology to monitor wide-ranging or migratory species.

   - **Exclusion Rule**: In the absence of observed migration patterns, **African Wild Dog** is ruled out from the study area.

## Effective Use of Survey Methods

By understanding and applying the exclusion criteria linked with each survey method, conservationists can more effectively deduce the presence of particular species. The ability to rule out certain animals allows researchers to refine their focus and resources, ultimately enhancing conservation tactics and outcomes.

Whether through direct or indirect observation, employing these diverse survey techniques helps build a clearer picture of species’ habits and habitats, guiding effective conservation actions. By keeping these rules in mind, researchers can contribute significantly to the protection of these endangered species.
