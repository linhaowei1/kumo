### Wildlife Conservation Strategy Guide

#### Introduction to Endangered Animal Species

Our mission is to conserve and protect some of the world's most endangered animal species. This guide focuses on four specific species that are in critical need of conservation efforts:

1. **Giant Panda**: Native to the mountain ranges in central China, the giant panda is a global symbol of wildlife conservation. Their population has been threatened due to habitat loss, primarily from deforestation.

2. **Grevy's Zebra**: Found mostly in Kenya and Ethiopia, Grevy's zebra is the largest and most threatened among zebra species. Major threats include loss of habitat and competition with livestock for resources.

3. **African Wild Dog**: These highly social carnivores are native to sub-Saharan Africa. The African wild dog faces threats from habitat fragmentation, human-wildlife conflict, and infectious diseases.

4. **Red Wolf**: Once widespread throughout the southeastern United States, the red wolf is one of the world's most endangered canids. The primary threats to their existence include habitat degradation and hybridization with coyotes.

#### Wildlife Survey Methods

To better understand and protect these endangered species, researchers employ various survey methods. Each method provides valuable data but comes with specific criteria for determining which species may be ruled out based on certain observations.

1. **Footprint Analysis**
   - This technique involves analyzing footprints left by animals. By understanding the size and shape of footprints, researchers can identify or rule out certain species.
   - **Exclusion Criteria:**
     - If footprints are analyzed in areas spanning 15 to 50 units (e.g., cm, meters), both the African wild dog and the red wolf must be excluded.
     - In any other size range, no species are ruled out.

2. **Aerial Surveys**
   - Conducted from aircraft, these surveys allow for large-scale observation, particularly beneficial in open landscapes.
   - **Exclusion Criteria:**
     - If no large herds are observed, Grevy's zebra must be excluded.
     - This method does not rule out marine mammals in this context, as we are focusing on terrestrial species.

3. **Baited Hair Traps**
   - This method uses bait to attract animals that leave behind hair samples, which can be analyzed for DNA.
   - **Exclusion Criteria:**
     - In cases where no bear hair is detected, the giant panda is ruled out.

4. **eDNA Sampling**
   - This involves collecting environmental DNA from soil, water, or air samples to identify the presence of species without seeing them.
   - **Exclusion Criteria:**
     - If no canid DNA is found, the African wild dog is excluded.

5. **Pheromone Traps**
   - Use pheromones to attract specific animals, useful in studying behavior and presence.
   - **Exclusion Criteria:**
     - If there are no responses from canids, the African wild dog is ruled out.

6. **Scat Analysis**
   - By analyzing feces, researchers can gather information on diet, health, and even the exact species.
   - **Exclusion Criteria:**
     - For scat sizes between 5 and 20 units, both the African wild dog and the red wolf are ruled out.

#### Conclusion

By employing these survey methods strategically, researchers can gather essential data about the presence and health of endangered species, helping inform conservation actions. It's crucial to apply the exclusion criteria correctly to focus efforts on the relevant species within a given area, maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of conservation strategies. This guide provides a foundational understanding to approach wildlife surveys with critical insight into the unique characteristics and needs of the featured endangered species.
