# Wildlife Conservation Strategy Guide

This guide provides an overview of the endangered animal species we are focusing on and the methods used for wildlife surveys. We aim to help you understand how each survey method works and how it helps us either confirm or exclude the presence of specific species. Here are the key points regarding our target species and the methods employed.

## Endangered Animal Species

### 1. Mountain Pygmy Possum
The Mountain Pygmy Possum is a small marsupial found in the alpine regions of Australia. It is threatened by climate change and habitat loss.

### 2. Red Panda
The Red Panda is a small mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. Its population is declining due to habitat destruction and poaching.

### 3. Dolphins
Dolphins are marine mammals found in oceans worldwide. They face threats from fishing nets, habitat degradation, and pollution.

### 4. African Wild Dog
The African Wild Dog, also known as the Painted Wolf, is a social predator found in sub-Saharan Africa. It is endangered due to human-wildlife conflict and habitat fragmentation.

## Wildlife Survey Methods

### 1. Acoustic Monitoring
Acoustic monitoring involves recording and analyzing sounds to identify animal presence. However, different frequency observations allow us to exclude certain species from additional consideration:
- **0-20 Hz** and **20-20000 Hz** recordings do not rule out any specific species.
- **20000-100000 Hz** recordings exclude Dolphins.

### 2. Scat Analysis
This method analyzes animal droppings to identify presence and diet. Observations lead to the following exclusions:
- **0-1 items**: No species are excluded.
- **1-5 items**: Red Panda is excluded.
- **5-20 items**: African Wild Dog is excluded.
- **20-100 items** and **100-5000 items**: No exclusions.

### 3. Thermal Imaging
Using heat signatures to detect animals can be particularly effective at night. Specific exclusions based on findings are:
- **No Large Heat Signatures**: No species are excluded.
- **No Small Mammals Detected**: Mountain Pygmy Possum is excluded.

### 4. Pitfall Traps
These are physical traps used to capture small creatures, helping to exclude species by absence:
- **No Small Mammals Captured**: Mountain Pygmy Possum is excluded.
- **No Amphibians Found**: No species are excluded.

### 5. eDNA Sampling
This involves collecting environmental DNA from soil, water, or air to detect species presence. Its exclusions are defined as follows:
- **No Aquatic DNA Detected**: No species are excluded.
- **No Canid DNA Found**: African Wild Dog is excluded.

### 6. Footprint Analysis
Footprint analysis involves identifying species based on their tracks. Here are the exclusions:
- **0-5 footprints**: Mountain Pygmy Possum is excluded.
- **5-15 footprints**: Red Panda is excluded.
- **15-50 footprints**: African Wild Dog is excluded.
- **50-4000 footprints**: No exclusions.

## Conclusion

By understanding the specific conditions under which different species are ruled out using these survey methods, conservationists can more accurately focus their efforts on the presence or absence of endangered species in a given region. This strategic approach helps optimize resources and implement targeted protective measures to ensure the survival and wellbeing of these endangered animals.
