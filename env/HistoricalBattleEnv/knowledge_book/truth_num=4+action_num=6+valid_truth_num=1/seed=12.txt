## Artifact Analysis Methods and Historical Record Comparisons

To understand each battle's context, it is important to apply various analysis methods which help to identify or exclude certain battles based on their specific outcomes:

### 1. Historical Record Analysis

- **Extensive Documentation**:
  - If extensive documentation is observed, the battles of Agincourt, Hastings, and Manzikert can be ruled out as they are known for having extensive documentation.

- **Minimal Documentation**:
  - A minimal documentation outcome suggests ruling out the Battle of Marathon.

### 2. Topographical Survey

- **Altered Terrain**:
  - Outcomes revealing altered terrain suggest ruling out the Battles of Agincourt and Manzikert.

- **Unchanged Terrain**:
  - If the terrain is unchanged, eliminate the Battles of Hastings and Marathon.

### 3. Climate Analysis

- **No Relevant Climate Data**:
  - Absence of relevant climate data may rule out the Battles of Manzikert and Marathon.

- **Relevant Climate Data**:
  - If relevant climate data exists, eliminate the Battles of Agincourt and Hastings due to their lack of climate impact.

### 4. Artifact Excavation

- **Significant Artifacts Found**:
  - If significant artifacts are discovered, this rules out the Battles of Agincourt and Hastings, known for having no artifacts found.

- **No Artifacts Found**:
  - Absence of artifacts points towards ruling out the Battles of Manzikert and Marathon.

### 5. Weapon Material Analysis

- **Bronze / Gunpowder-based Materials**:
  - Discoveries of these materials would suggest excluding the Battle of Marathon, typically associated with iron, steel, or modern alloys.

- **Iron / Steel / Modern Alloys**:
  - If iron, steel, or modern alloys are identified, rule out battles associated with different materials as per the mapping.

### 6. Inscription Translation

- **Greek Translations**:
  - Observations of Greek inscriptions necessitate ruling out the Battles of Agincourt and Hastings.

- **Latin / Old English**:
  - The presence of these languages suggests ruling out the Battle of Marathon.

## Conclusion

By carefully applying the analysis methods and understanding their exclusionary results, historians can narrow down the possible events being analyzed. This guide serves as a foundational tool for understanding the relationships between historical battles and the evidence used to support or rule out their occurrences. Whether itâ€™s through documentation, terrain, climate, artifacts, weapon materials, or language, each method provides critical clues that aid in deciphering historical truths.
