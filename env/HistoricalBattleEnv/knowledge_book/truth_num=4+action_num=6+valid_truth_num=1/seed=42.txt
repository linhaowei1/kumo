1. **Artifact Excavation**
    - **Significant Artifacts Found**: Rule out Battles of Thermopylae, Manzikert, and Marathon.
    - **No Artifacts Found**: Rule out Battle of Hastings.

2. **Historical Record Analysis**
    - **Minimal Documentation**: Rule out Battles of Thermopylae and Marathon.
    - **Extensive Documentation**: Rule out Battles of Hastings and Manzikert.

3. **Carbon Dating**
    - **Time Range: -500 to 500 AD**: Rule out Battles of Hastings and Manzikert.
    - **Time Range: 500 to 1000 AD**: Rule out Battles of Thermopylae and Marathon.
    - **Time Range: 1000 to 1500 AD**: Rule out Battles of Thermopylae and Marathon.
    - **Time Range: 1500 to 2000 AD**: Rule out Battles of Thermopylae and Marathon.

4. **Weapon Material Analysis**

    - **Unchanged Terrain**: Rule out Battles of Hastings, Thermopylae, and Marathon.

6. **Battle Tactics Study**
    - **Simple Tactics**: No battles are ruled out.
    - **Complex Tactics**: Rule out Battles of Hastings, Thermopylae, Manzikert, and Marathon.

## Conclusion

This guidebook aims to assist historians and researchers in identifying which battles can be potentially ruled out or maintained as possible based on the outcomes derived from various artifact analysis methods. Understanding these methods and outcomes provides a clearer, more objective lens through which we can examine and interpret historical events. By considering what is ruled out, historians can narrow down their focus to more likely scenarios, advancing our understanding of these pivotal moments in history.
