# Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook. This resource is designed to help you understand various cryptographic ciphers and the analysis techniques that can be applied to assess and differentiate them. By the end of this guidebook, you should have a foundational understanding of how these ciphers work and how to identify them using specific crypt-analysis techniques.

## Cryptographic Ciphers Overview

### Triple DES Cipher
- **Description**: Triple DES (3DES) is an enhancement of the Data Encryption Standard (DES). It applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to each data block.
- **Key Features**: It uses a key bundle comprising three DES keys, totaling 168 bits. It operates with a block size of 64 bits.

### Serpent Cipher
- **Description**: Serpent is a symmetric key block cipher notable for its high security and resistance against linear and differential attacks.
- **Key Features**: It uses a block size of 128 bits and can accommodate key sizes up to 256 bits.

### RC4 Cipher
- **Description**: RC4 is a stream cipher known for its simplicity and speed, especially popular in protocols like SSL and WEP.
- **Key Features**: It operates byte by byte using a variable key size typically up to 256 bits.

### Goldbach Cipher
- **Description**: Note that the Goldbach cipher as a term is unconventional in cryptography and could refer to a substitution cipher based on number theory principles.
- **Key Features**: Generally involves substitution patterns based on arithmetic properties.

## Cryptographic Analysis Techniques

### Frequency Analysis
- **Purpose**: To identify patterns in the frequency of characters or data elements which can give clues about substitution schemes.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Frequencies similar to natural language**: Rules out `Serpent cipher`, `RC4 cipher` as they are expected to display message frequencies akin to typical linguistic texts.
  - **Frequencies indicate substitution patterns**: If observed, the `Goldbach cipher` can be ruled out due to predictable substitution distributions.
  - **Frequencies appear random**: No rule-outs; this result requires further analysis based on ciphertext characteristics.

### Linear Cryptanalysis
- **Purpose**: To detect linear approximations within the cipher that might lead to vulnerabilities.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **High linear probability**: No current rule-outs; more analysis is needed for other characteristics.

  - **Low linear probability**: Rules out `Serpent cipher` as it is designed to present low linear probabilities.

### Block Size Analysis
- **Purpose**: To determine the size of the blocks used in encryption, which can assist in identifying the cipher type.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Block Size (0, 64 bits)**: Rules out `Triple DES cipher` due to its 64-bit block nature.
  - **Block Size (65, 256 bits)**: Rules out `Serpent cipher`, usually employing a 128-bit block size.

### Avalanche Effect Measurement
- **Purpose**: To measure the sensitivity of the output to changes in the input.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Avalanche (0, 50)**: No exclusion.
  - **Avalanche (51, 100)**: Rules out `RC4 cipher`, as stream ciphers typically display less pronounced avalanche effects compared to block ciphers.

### Key Length Estimation
- **Purpose**: To estimate the length of the cryptographic key being used.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Key (0, 128 bits)**: Rules out `RC4 cipher` as it generally employs longer keys.
  - **No exclusion for key lengths 129-256, 257-1024**: Further detailed key analysis is needed.

### Timing Attack
- **Purpose**: To assess vulnerabilities based on the time taken to execute cryptographic operations.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Timing leak detected**: No current rule-outs.
  - **No timing leak detected**: Rules out `RC4 cipher`, usually unaffected by timing attacks given its operational simplicity.

## Conclusion

By understanding these cryptographic ciphers and techniques, you can effectively rule out certain algorithms based on observed outcomes. This exclusionary method focuses your analysis, helping you focus on ciphers that fit the observed behavior while ruling out those that do not. Always approach cryptanalysis methodically, using a combination of techniques for robust and reliable results.
