# Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook

Cryptography is the art and science of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format for unauthorized users. Understanding different cryptographic ciphers and analytical techniques is essential for deciphering encrypted messages. This guidebook will introduce you to some commonly used ciphers and analysis techniques, assisting you in identifying and excluding possibilities during cryptographic analysis.

## Chapter 1: Cryptographic Ciphers

### 1.1 Salsa20 Cipher
Salsa20 is a stream cipher known for its speed and simplicity. It converts plaintext into ciphertext using a symmetric key. Designed for efficiency in software, it doesn't alter frequency distributions, meaning its encrypted outputs do not resemble natural language frequencies.

### 1.2 Columnar Transposition Cipher
A classical transposition cipher rearranges characters based on a defined geometric pattern. The readability is preserved at the character level but reordered so that typical frequencies remain recognizable but misaligned.

### 1.3 Gronsfeld Cipher
This is a variant of the Vigenère cipher that uses digits for its key. The frequencies of the ciphertext appear random, similar to those of a Vigenère cipher because both involve shifting letters from the alphabet.

### 1.4 ROT13 Cipher
ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that rotates each character by 13 places in the alphabet. Despite transforming message content, it results in a frequency distribution that still mirrors natural languages due to its straightforward reversible nature.

## Chapter 2: Cryptographic Techniques

### 2.1 Frequency Analysis
This technique examines how often characters appear in the ciphertext. It helps determine whether a cipher uses transposition or substitution:

- **Frequencies similar to natural language**: Excludes Salsa20
- **Frequencies indicate substitution patterns**: Excludes Columnar Transposition
- **Frequencies appear random**: Excludes ROT13 and Gronsfeld

### 2.2 Known Plaintext Attack
In this strategy, the attacker has access to both plaintext and its ciphertext. It is effective against:

- **Successful attack**: Excludes Columnar Transposition
- **Unsuccessful attack**: Does not exclude any ciphers

### 2.3 Entropy Measurement
Entropy measures randomness. Different ciphers have distinct entropy levels based on their complexity:

- **Low entropy (0-3)**: Excludes ROT13
- **Medium entropy (3-8)**: No exclusions
- **High entropy (8-10)**: No exclusions

### 2.4 Ciphertext Length Analysis
This technique assesses the relationship between plaintext and ciphertext lengths:

- **Length equals plaintext length**: Excludes Columnar Transposition, ROT13, and Gronsfeld
- **Length greater than plaintext length**: No exclusions, but note that length increase could indicate block ciphers with padding

### 2.5 Avalanche Effect Measurement
This evaluates how slight changes in plaintext affect ciphertext:

- **Minimal change (0-50%)**: Excludes ROT13
- **Significant change (51-100%)**: No exclusions

### 2.6 Key Pattern Testing
Cipher resilience to key pattern analysis:

- **Susceptible (0-50%)**: Excludes ROT13 and Gronsfeld
- **Resilient (51-100%)**: No exclusions

## Chapter 3: Analyzing Cipher Outcomes

When applying these techniques, remember:

- Use **Frequency Analysis** to exclude ciphers that do not match observed distributions.
- A **Known Plaintext Attack** excludes Columnar Transposition when the attack is successful.
- **Entropy Measurement** helps filter out ciphers with simplicity lower than a specified threshold.
- **Ciphertext Length Analysis** will rule out ciphers that do not match the observed ciphertext length relationship.
- The **Avalanche Effect Measurement** and **Key Pattern Testing** help exclude ciphers that exhibit little sensitivity to key or input modifications.

By systematically applying these cryptographic techniques and understanding the resulting outcomes, you'll be better equipped to determine which ciphers can be excluded after each step of analysis. This structured approach ensures clarity and helps refine your potential target ciphers in the decryption task.
