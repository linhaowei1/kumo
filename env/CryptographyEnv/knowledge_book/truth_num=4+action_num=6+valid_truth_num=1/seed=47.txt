# Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook, designed to introduce you to some fundamental ciphers and analysis techniques. This guide will help you understand specific cryptographic ciphers and how to analyze them using various techniques. It's essential to grasp not just the basics of each cipher and technique, but also how to interpret the outcomes of these techniques to rule out certain ciphers.

## Cryptographic Ciphers

### Twofish Cipher
Twofish is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key lengths up to 256 bits. It uses a complex key schedule and supports various key lengths, making it versatile and secure against many types of attacks. The design focuses on speed, flexibility, and resilience.

### RC6 Cipher
RC6 is a symmetric key block cipher derived from RC5. It includes integer multiplication among its primitive operations, which aids in diffusion. Like Twofish, it works with a block size of 128 bits and supports variable key lengths, typically up to 256 bits. It's known for its simplicity and strength against brute-force attacks.

### CAST5 Cipher
CAST5 (also known as CAST-128) is a block cipher that's well-regarded for its usability in network protocols. It uses a block size of 64 bits and key sizes ranging from 40 to 128 bits. CAST5 emphasizes security through a series of rounds that introduce complex operations for data mixing.

### Transposition Cipher
A Transposition cipher is a simple method of encryption where the positions of characters in the plaintext are shifted according to some system, without altering the characters themselves. It's often used in classic cryptography and is vulnerable to a variety of attacks due to its simplicity.

## Techniques

### Frequency Analysis
Frequency analysis involves studying how frequently certain symbols or combinations of symbols occur in a ciphertext. It is useful in identifying the types of ciphers used based on the patterns they exhibit.

- **Frequencies similar to natural language:** If the frequencies of letters or symbols in the ciphertext resemble those found in natural language, rule out CAST5, RC6, and Twofish ciphers, as they typically don't show this pattern.
  
- **Frequencies indicate substitution patterns:** If there are consistent substitution patterns, rule out the Transposition cipher, as it doesn't change symbol frequencies.
  
- **Frequencies appear random:** If no discernible pattern emerges, no specific ciphers can be ruled out based solely on frequency.

### Error Analysis
Error analysis studies how small errors in the input affect the output in different cryptographic systems.

- **Error propagation minimal:** If errors in plaintext minimally affect the ciphertext, rule out the Transposition cipher, as it's designed to do exactly that.
  
- **Error propagates significantly:** If small errors cause significant changes, no specific ciphers can be ruled out based solely on this parameter.

### Key Length Estimation
Key length estimation refers to the process of determining potential key sizes used in encryption, crucial for assessing the security of a cipher.

- **Key lengths between 129 and 256 bits:** Rule out the Twofish cipher if this specific range is detected, as it supports wider ranges.

### Brute Force Attack
Brute force attacks attempt to crack cipher keys by trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found.

- **82 to 100 bits deemed weak:** If efficiency in less than this range is found, rule out the Twofish cipher, as it often requires key lengths beyond 128 bits.

### Ciphertext Length Analysis
Ciphertext length analysis compares the length of the ciphertext to the original plaintext, revealing certain characteristics of the encryption method.

- **Ciphertext length equals plaintext length:** If these lengths are equal, rule out the Transposition cipher.
  
- **Ciphertext length greater than plaintext length:** If this condition is observed, rule out the Twofish cipher, as compression techniques or hash functions may alter lengths.

### Known Plaintext Attack
In known plaintext attacks, attackers have access to both the plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext and seek to deduce the secret key.

- **Attack successful:** If this type of attack is successful, rule out the Transposition cipher.

- **Attack unsuccessful:** If attempts fail, no specific ciphers can be ruled out merely by this method.

### Conclusion

Using this guidebook, you can determine which ciphers can be ruled out when employing each analysis technique. Remember, the key to cryptographic analysis is not just in recognizing patterns, but in understanding how these patterns help you exclude impossibilities to narrow down your focus to potential viable ciphers. By carefully applying each technique, you'll become adept at deciphering encrypted messages while considering their strengths and weaknesses.
