# Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to this introduction to cryptographic ciphers and techniques, where we will explore some classic and contemporary methods used in the field of cryptography. Our objective is to provide a clear understanding of four ciphers and six analytical techniques, and how these techniques help in ruling out certain ciphers based on their observed outcomes.

## Cryptographic Ciphers Explained

### 1. **3DES Cipher (Triple DES)**
The 3DES cipher is an enhancement of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which encrypts data using three successive DES operations: Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt. It offers improved security compared to DES by effectively increasing the key length.

### 2. **Polybius Square Cipher**
This is a simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with coordinates on a 5x5 grid. It is mainly used for encrypting letters using numbers and is known for its straightforward application in symbology and steganography.

### 3. **Diffie-Hellman Cipher**
Diffie-Hellman is not actually a cipher but a method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. It allows two parties to generate a shared secret unobtainable by an eavesdropper.

### 4. **Autokey Cipher**
The Autokey cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses plaintext as a key. Once the initial key is exhausted, the plaintext itself becomes the key, creating a self-reciprocal cipher.

## Cryptographic Techniques

### 1. **Frequency Analysis**
This technique involves studying the frequency of appearance of elements (like letters) in a ciphertext. Patterns that emerge can give clues about the underlying structure of the cipher.

**Outcomes:**
- Frequencies similar to natural language: rules out **3DES Cipher**
- Frequencies indicating substitution patterns: rules out **Diffie-Hellman Cipher**
- Frequencies appearing random: rules out **Polybius Square Cipher, Autokey Cipher**

### 2. **Key Pattern Testing**
Key pattern testing involves evaluating the possible patterns in encryption keys used by a cipher.

**Outcomes:**
- Key complexity measurement between 0-50: Excludes no specific ciphers
- Key complexity measurement between 51-100: rules out **3DES Cipher**

### 3. **Brute Force Attack**
This technique tries all possible keys until the correct one is found. It's often computationally expensive.

**Outcomes:**
- Feasibility index between 0-80: Excludes no specific ciphers
- Feasibility index between 81-100: rules out **3DES Cipher**

### 4. **Ciphertext Length Analysis**
This involves comparing the length of the ciphertext to the plaintext.

**Outcomes:**
- Ciphertext length equals plaintext length: Excludes no specific ciphers
- Ciphertext length greater than plaintext length: rules out **3DES Cipher**

### 5. **Linear Cryptanalysis**
This statistical attack exploits linear approximations of a cipher.

**Outcomes:**
- High linear probability: Excludes no specific ciphers
- Low linear probability: Excludes no specific ciphers

### 6. **Avalanche Effect Measurement**
This measures the extent of change in the output when a single bit of the input is varied, fundamental to evaluating the strength of a cipher.

**Outcomes:**
- Avalanche effect between 0-50: Excludes no specific ciphers
- Avalanche effect between 51-100: Excludes no specific ciphers

## Applying Techniques and Understanding Outcomes

When applying these techniques, use the analyzed outcomes to narrow down the possible encryption methods. Remember, the aim of each technique is to exclude possibles rather than to confirm a cipher. For instance:
- If frequency analysis shows natural language frequency patterns, you would exclude 3DES from consideration.
- If key pattern testing shows high complexity, it's likely not 3DES in play.
- If ciphertext length is greater than the plaintext length during analysis, rule out 3DES.

Through methodical exclusion based on these results, you will be better equipped to deduce the most plausible cipher used in a given scenario. 

Remember, cryptanalysis is as much about eliminating improbabilities as it is about discovering strengths and weaknesses. Use this guide to enhance your cryptographic skill set and appreciate the intricate art of code-breaking!
