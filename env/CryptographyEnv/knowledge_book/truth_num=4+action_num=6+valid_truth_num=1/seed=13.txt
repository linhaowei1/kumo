# Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

Cryptography is the science of securing information through transformation into unreadable formats, except to those possessing a critical piece of information known as a key. In this guidebook, we will delve into four specific cryptographic ciphers and analyze them using various cryptographic techniques. Understanding these relationships helps determine how different ciphers behave under specific analytical techniques by ruling them out based on observed outcomes.

### Cryptographic Ciphers Explained

1. **Diffie-Hellman Cipher**
   - This cipher is primarily a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. It allows two parties to establish a shared secret key, which can be used for encrypted communication.

2. **CAST5 Cipher**
   - CAST5 is a symmetric key block cipher known for encryption with a key size ranging from 40 to 128 bits. It is used for secure data encryption and supports variable block sizes.

3. **Vernam Cipher**
   - Also known as the one-time pad, this cipher achieves perfect secrecy by combining plaintext with a random key or pad that is as long as the message itself.

4. **Rail Fence Cipher**
   - This is a type of transposition cipher that encrypts by writing the message in a zigzag pattern and then reading it off line by line.

### Cryptographic Techniques

1. **Frequency Analysis**
   - This technique examines the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a cipher to detect patterns similar to natural language or substitution patterns.
   
   - **Rule-Out Information:**
     - **Frequencies similar to natural language**: Rule out `CAST5 cipher` and `Vernam cipher`.
     - **Frequencies indicate substitution patterns**: Rule out `Rail Fence cipher` and `Diffie-Hellman cipher`.
     - **Frequencies appear random**: No ciphers are ruled out.

2. **Error Analysis**
   - Error analysis assesses how errors in transmission affect the decrypted message. Some ciphers propagate errors throughout the message, while others contain them.
   
   - **Rule-Out Information:**
     - **Error propagation minimal**: Rule out `Rail Fence cipher`.
     - **Error propagates significantly**: No ciphers are ruled out.

3. **Side-Channel Attack**
   - This technique involves gaining information from the implementation of a cipher rather than weaknesses in the cipher algorithms, such as the time duration of operations or power consumption.
   
   - **Rule-Out Information:**
     - **Attack reveals key**: No ciphers are ruled out.
     - **No key information leaked**: Rule out `Vernam cipher`.

4. **Entropy Measurement**
   - Entropy measures the unpredictability or randomness of a cipher's output. A high entropy suggests a more secure cipher.
   
   - **Rule-Out Information:**
     - **Entropy 0 to 3**: No ciphers are ruled out.
     - **Entropy 3 to 8**: No ciphers are ruled out.
     - **Entropy 8 to 10**: Rule out `Vernam cipher`.

5. **Key Pattern Testing**
   - This technique examines the complexity of the cipher's key. Ciphers with complex keys are typically more resistant to attacks.
   
   - **Rule-Out Information:**
     - **Key pattern 0 to 50**: No ciphers are ruled out.
     - **Key pattern 51 to 100**: Rule out `Vernam cipher`.

6. **Brute Force Attack**
   - This attack attempts to decode a cipher by trying every possible key combination until the correct one is found. The feasibility depends on the key's length.
   
   - **Rule-Out Information:**
     - **Brute force resistance 0 to 80**: No ciphers are ruled out.
     - **Brute force resistance 81 to 100**: Rule out `Vernam cipher`.

## Conclusion

By using these techniques, cryptanalysts can systematically eliminate certain ciphers when certain analytical outcomes are observed. This guide serves as a foundation for understanding how to analyze and differentiate between cryptographic ciphers using cryptanalysis techniques. Remember, the cornerstone of these analyses is the ability to rule out possibilities, ultimately narrowing down the potential ciphers being analyzed. Understanding these relationships enhances the security and efficiency of cryptographic systems.
