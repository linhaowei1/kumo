# Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook, where we explore and analyze various cryptographic ciphers and techniques. Whether you are a budding cryptographer or an enthusiast, this guide will provide you with a clear understanding of some popular ciphers and the methods used to analyze them. Through this guidebook, we will delve into the Rail Fence cipher, Skipjack cipher, Autokey cipher, and ROT13 cipher, alongside techniques such as Frequency analysis, Differential cryptanalysis, Error analysis, Entropy measurement, Ciphertext length analysis, and Known plaintext attack.

## Chapter 1: Cryptographic Ciphers

### 1.1 Rail Fence Cipher
The Rail Fence cipher is a type of transposition cipher that places the plaintext in a zigzag pattern over a series of 'rails' (rows). Encryption involves reading off the pattern to form the ciphertext. Since this is a simple transposition, the ciphertext length is equal to the plaintext length.

### 1.2 Skipjack Cipher
Skipjack is a block cipher developed by the NSA. It uses an 80-bit key to encrypt or decrypt data blocks of 64 bits. Its design is more complex, lending itself to deeper cryptographic analysis, such as differential cryptanalysis.

### 1.3 Autokey Cipher
The Autokey cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. It uses a key to start the encryption process, appending the message itself as a running key. The cipher tends to result in random frequency distributions in the ciphertext.

### 1.4 ROT13 Cipher
ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 positions down the alphabet. The encryption process is the same as decryption, and like the Rail Fence cipher, its ciphertext length remains equal to the plaintext length.

## Chapter 2: Cryptographic Techniques

### 2.1 Frequency Analysis
This technique involves studying the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext to determine patterns indicating the type of cipher used.

- **Frequencies similar to natural language**: If the frequency analysis shows a pattern similar to natural language, the Skipjack cipher must be ruled out.
- **Frequencies indicate substitution patterns**: If substitution patterns are evident, rule out the Rail Fence cipher.
- **Frequencies appear random**: If the pattern appears random, you can rule out the ROT13 and Autokey ciphers.

### 2.2 Differential Cryptanalysis
A form of cryptanalysis applicable primarily to block ciphers, this method involves studying how differences in input can affect the resultant differences in output, typically finding weaknesses in ciphers.

- **Differential characteristics found**: Rule out Skipjack cipher as it does have differential characteristics.
- **No differential characteristics found**: In such cases, all listed ciphers should still be considered.

### 2.3 Error Analysis
This technique examines how errors in the encrypted data affect the decrypted message. 

- **Error propagation minimal**: When error propagation is minimal, excluding Rail Fence cipher is necessary.
- **Error propagates significantly**: Both conditions imply no ciphers excluded (set remains empty).

### 2.4 Entropy Measurement
Entropy measures the unpredictability in the ciphertext. It aids in assessing the strength of encryption.

- **Entropy (0, 3):** If entropy falls within this range, the ROT13 cipher should be ruled out.
- **Entropy (3, 8) & (8, 10):** Indicate conditions for further analysis; no ciphers excluded.

### 2.5 Ciphertext Length Analysis
This involves comparing the length of ciphertext relative to plaintext. It helps determine the impact of the encryption on data size.

- **Ciphertext length equals plaintext length**: If this is seen, the ROT13 and Rail Fence ciphers must be ruled out.
- **Ciphertext length greater than plaintext length**: Suggests no exclusions are necessary.

### 2.6 Known Plaintext Attack
This attack type uses known sections of the plaintext to break a cipher by comparing it against the ciphertext.

- **Attack successful**: Results in ruling out the Rail Fence cipher.
- **Attack unsuccessful**: No specified ciphers are excluded.

## Conclusion

In summary, cryptographic analysis often involves ruling out potential ciphers based on observed outcomes during testing. By applying techniques such as frequency analysis, error analysis, and ciphertext length comparisons, among others, one can systematically exclude certain ciphers and hone in on the most likely encryption method used. Understanding this interplay between techniques and outcomes enables cryptographers to better assess and analyze cryptographic ciphers.
