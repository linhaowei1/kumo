# Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook

In this guidebook, we explore various cryptographic ciphers and techniques in an effort to understand their properties and applications. By applying different cryptanalytic techniques, we seek to rule out certain ciphers from being used in specific contexts. This approach aids in narrowing down possible ciphers based on observed outcomes without necessarily confirming the correct ones.

## Cryptographic Ciphers

### 1. LOKI97 Cipher
LOKI97 is a block cipher designed to offer robust security against known cryptanalytic attacks. It is known for its complexity and is designed to resist linear and differential cryptanalysis.

### 2. Serpent Cipher
Serpent is a symmetric key block cipher that was a finalist in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition. Known for its security, Serpent employs a series of substitution-permutation networks to ensure encrypted data is secure from various attacks.

### 3. ROT13 Cipher
ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher used primarily for obfuscation. It rotates each letter by 13 places in the alphabet. While not secure against serious attempts to decrypt, it illustrates basic substitution operations.

### 4. NTRU Cipher
NTRU is a lattice-based public key cryptographic system, which is unlike classical systems based on prime factorization. It's known for high speed and small key sizes compared to RSA, among other features.

## Techniques for Cryptanalysis

### 1. Frequency Analysis
This technique examines how frequently certain elements (like letters or symbols) appear in a ciphertext. It's useful for identifying patterns in substitution ciphers.

- **Frequencies similar to natural language**: This result can rule out the LOKI97 and Serpent ciphers.
- **Frequencies indicate substitution patterns**: Would rule out the NTRU cipher.
- **Frequencies appear random**: Suggests ruling out the ROT13 cipher.

### 2. Linear Cryptanalysis
It's a method of breaking symmetric key ciphers by examining their linear approximations.

- **High linear probability**: No ciphers are ruled out here.
- **Low linear probability**: This result indicates ruling out the Serpent cipher.

### 3. Avalanche Effect Measurement
The avalanche effect refers to a small change in plaintext resulting in a large change in ciphertext.

- **(0, 50)**: When measuring the avalanche effect and seeing minimal change, ROT13 should be ruled out.
- **(51, 100)**: No specific ciphers are ruled out in this range.

### 4. Block Size Analysis
This involves analyzing the size of blocks that a cipher operates on.

- **(0, 64)**: No ciphers are excluded in this range.
- **(65, 256)**: Indicates ruling out the Serpent cipher.

### 5. Brute Force Attack
A brute force attack tries every possible key to decrypt a message.

- **(0, 80)**: Under lenient conditions, ROT13 cipher can be ruled out due to its simplicity.
- **(81, 100)**: Serpent should be ruled out, indicating it has a larger key space that resists brute force within this range.

### 6. Ciphertext Length Analysis
This technique assesses whether the ciphertext length diverges from the plaintext length.

- **Ciphertext length equals plaintext length**: If observed, ROT13 is ruled out.
- **Ciphertext length greater than plaintext length**: When this result is noted, rule out Serpent and NTRU ciphers.

## Conclusion

By methodically applying these cryptographic techniques, practitioners can effectively rule out specific ciphers based on observed outcomes. This process aids in narrowing down the possibilities, facilitating a more targeted analysis while enhancing comprehension of various cipher characteristics.
