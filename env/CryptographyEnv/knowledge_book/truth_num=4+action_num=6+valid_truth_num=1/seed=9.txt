# Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook is designed to provide a clear understanding of various cryptographic ciphers and analysis techniques. The goal is to equip readers with the knowledge to evaluate and eliminate certain ciphers based on the outcomes of specific cryptographic tests. By understanding these ciphers and techniques, you can effectively analyze the strength and weaknesses of cryptographic systems.

## Cryptographic Ciphers

### 1. Vigenère Cipher
The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A key is needed to shift letters, cycling through each letter of the text. While stronger than a simple substitution cipher, it remains vulnerable to frequency analysis, especially with a short key.

### 2. Substitution Cipher
The substitution cipher is one of the simplest encryption methods. In this cipher, each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another letter. Although easy to crack with frequency analysis due to preserving letter frequencies, it lays the foundation for understanding more complex systems.

### 3. AES Cipher
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric key cipher recognized for its strength and efficiency. Using block cipher techniques, AES encrypts and decrypts blocks of data through several rounds of substitution, permutation, and mixing. It's widely adopted for securing data.

### 4. Columnar Transposition Cipher
In the columnar transposition cipher, plaintext is written in rows and then read off in columns based on a defined key. Although it doesn’t alter letter frequencies, it scrambles their positions, making it more secure than simple substitution but still vulnerable if the pattern is detected.

## Techniques for Cryptographic Analysis

### 1. Entropy Measurement
Entropy measures the uncertainty or randomness in a cryptographic system. It quantifies how predictable the encryption is to an attacker. Higher entropy implies higher security.

    - Outcomes:
        - Entropy (0, 3): If observed, rule out Substitution cipher.
        - Entropy (3, 8): If observed, rule out Vigenère cipher.
        - Entropy (8, 10): If observed, rule out AES cipher.

### 2. Avalanche Effect Measurement
The avalanche effect measures the change in ciphertext when a single bit in the plaintext or key changes. A strong algorithm will show a significant change.

    - Outcomes:
        - Avalanche (0, 50): If observed, rule out Substitution cipher.
        - Avalanche (51, 100): If observed, rule out AES cipher.

### 3. Error Analysis
Error analysis evaluates how errors in transmission affect ciphertext and decrypted plaintext.

    - Outcomes:
        - Error propagation minimal: If observed, rule out Columnar Transposition cipher.
        - Error propagates significantly: If observed, rule out AES cipher.

### 4. Known Plaintext Attack
Known plaintext attack involves the attacker having access to both readable (plaintext) and encrypted data (ciphertext) to extract further information about the key or ciphertext.

    - Outcomes:
        - Attack successful: If observed, rule out Columnar Transposition, Substitution, and Vigenère ciphers.
        - Attack unsuccessful: If observed, rule out AES cipher.

### 5. Key Pattern Testing
Examines the impact of different key patterns on encrypting data.

    - Outcomes:
        - Key pattern (0, 50): If observed, rule out Substitution and Vigenère ciphers.
        - Key pattern (51, 100): If observed, rule out AES cipher.

### 6. Differential Cryptanalysis
A method of examining the structure of a cipher by comparing the differences between pairs of inputs and their respective outputs.

    - Outcomes:
        - Differential characteristics found: None observed, hence no ciphers are ruled out.
        - No differential characteristics found: If observed, rule out AES cipher.

## Conclusion

This guidebook lays out a systematic approach for the analysis of different cryptographic ciphers by ruling them out based on the results of specific tests. This exclusion-based strategy helps in narrowing down the possible algorithms that could be used in a given cryptographic context. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each method ensures the development and evaluation of more robust security measures.
