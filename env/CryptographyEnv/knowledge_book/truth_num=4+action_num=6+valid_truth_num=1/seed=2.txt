# Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

Cryptographic analysis involves examining encrypted data to understand how it was created or to attempt to reverse the encryption. In this guidebook, we will explore an introduction to four cryptographic ciphers and six cryptographic analysis techniques. By applying these techniques, you can rule out specific ciphers based on observed outcomes, which helps to identify or narrow down the potential cipher used in a given scenario.

### Cryptographic Ciphers

1. **Polybius Square Cipher**:
   - A simple substitution cipher using a two-dimensional square grid. Each letter is represented by a pair of coordinates.
   - Typically shows random frequency patterns when compared to natural language due to its substitution nature.

2. **RC5 Cipher**:
   - A symmetric block cipher known for its simplicity and variable parameters, such as block size, key size, and number of rounds.
   - Frequencies resemble natural language patterns due to its encryption nature. It is vulnerable to linear cryptanalysis with high linear probabilities.

3. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) Cipher**:
   - A symmetric block cipher using fixed block sizes and key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
   - Shows low linear probability and no differential characteristics. Frequencies may resemble natural language patterns under certain analyses.

4. **Triple DES Cipher**:
   - An adaptation of the DES cipher applying the DES algorithm three times in sequence, enhancing encryption strength.
   - Operates on 64-bit block size, making it identifiable in block size analysis.

### Cryptographic Techniques

1. **Frequency Analysis**:
   - Observes the frequency of characters in the encrypted message.
   - Outcome Analysis:
     - If frequencies resemble natural language, rule out AES and RC5.
     - If random frequencies appear, rule out the Polybius Square cipher.

2. **Linear Cryptanalysis**:
   - Analyzes linear approximations to describe the behavior of the block cipher.
   - Outcome Analysis:
     - High linear probability rules out RC5.
     - Low linear probability rules out AES.

3. **Block Size Analysis**:
   - Determines block size used in encryption by breaking it down into manageable units.
   - Outcome Analysis:
     - Block size 0-64 bits rules out Triple DES.
     - Block size 65-256 bits rules out AES.

4. **Differential Cryptanalysis**:
   - Studies the effect of differences in input on the differences at the output.
   - Outcome Analysis:
     - Differential characteristics found rules out nothing.
     - If none are found, rule out AES.

5. **Key Length Estimation**:
   - Estimates potential key sizes used in an encryption algorithm.
   - Outcome Analysis:
     - Key length 0-128 bits rules out nothing.
     - Key length 129-256 bits rules out AES.

6. **Key Pattern Testing**:
   - Looks for specific patterns or structures in keys.
   - Outcome Analysis:
     - Key patterns of 0-50 bits rule out nothing.
     - Key patterns of 51-100 bits rules out AES.

## Summary of Rule-Out Outcomes

### Frequency Analysis

- **Frequencies similar to natural language**: Rule out AES and RC5.
- **Frequencies appear random**: Rule out Polybius Square cipher.

### Linear Cryptanalysis

- **High linear probability**: Rule out RC5 cipher.
- **Low linear probability**: Rule out AES cipher.

### Block Size Analysis

- **Block size range (0, 64)**: Rule out Triple DES cipher.
- **Block size range (65, 256)**: Rule out AES cipher.

### Differential Cryptanalysis

- **No differential characteristics found**: Rule out AES cipher.

### Key Length Estimation

- **Key length (129, 256)**: Rule out AES cipher.

### Key Pattern Testing

- **Key patterns (51, 100)**: Rule out AES cipher.

## Conclusion

By systematically applying these cryptographic techniques and understanding the outcomes, you can effectively narrow down which ciphers were not used for encryption. This guidebook provides the basic principles for conducting such analyses and using the results to exclude possibilities, thereby aiding in cryptographic identification.
