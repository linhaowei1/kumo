# Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook—a comprehensive introduction to understanding and applying various cryptographic ciphers and techniques. This guide aims to help you navigate through the complex landscape of cryptography by providing clear explanations and rule-out criteria for each cipher based on specific outcomes from the analysis techniques.

## Overview of Cryptographic Ciphers

Let's begin by exploring the cryptographic ciphers we will analyze:

### 1. ChaCha Cipher

The ChaCha cipher is a stream cipher known for its speed and security. It uses a pseudo-random number generator to encrypt data by performing a series of rounds that involve bitwise operations, modular addition, and constant shuffling of inputs.

### 2. Substitution Cipher

A substitution cipher is one of the most straightforward forms of encryption where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a corresponding letter in the ciphertext. Simple examples include Caesar Ciphers. These ciphers are vulnerable to frequency analysis since they maintain the structure of the plaintext language.

### 3. RC4 Cipher

RC4 is a stream cipher widely used in protocols like HTTPS. It generates a pseudorandom keystream which is then XORed with the plaintext. Its simplicity makes it fast but also susceptible to certain attacks and biases, therefore it is less recommended nowadays for secure applications.

### 4. ElGamal Cipher

ElGamal is a public-key cipher based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It uses randomness and modular arithmetic to provide security. The size of its ciphertexts is typically larger than the plaintext.

## Cryptographic Techniques

Next, we analyze the techniques used to investigate the characteristics of ciphers:

### Frequency Analysis

This technique looks at how often each character or symbol appears in the ciphertext. It is highly effective against substitution ciphers, where certain frequencies can indicate patterns.

### Key Length Estimation

This approach involves estimating the length of the key used in encryption. Knowledge of key length is crucial for certain attacks.

### Brute Force Attack

This technique involves systematically trying every possible combination of a key until the correct one is found. The feasibility of this method depends on the key space size. 

### Side-Channel Attack

A side-channel attack exploits information leakage from the physical implementation of the cryptographic algorithm, such as timing information or electromagnetic emissions.

### Ciphertext Length Analysis

This analysis studies the relationship between the lengths of plaintext and ciphertext. Certain ciphers reveal their use through characteristic lengths.

### Key Pattern Testing

This technique involves analyzing whether the keys used in encryption follow certain repeating patterns or structures.

## Analysis Outcomes

Based on the results obtained from these techniques, we can rule out certain ciphers using established relationships. Here’s how:

### Frequency Analysis Results

- **Frequencies similar to natural language** rule out **ChaCha, ElGamal, and RC4 ciphers**.
- **Frequencies appear random** rule out **Substitution cipher**.

### Key Length Estimation Results

- Estimated key lengths between 0 and 128 rule out **RC4 cipher**.
- Estimated key lengths between 257 and 1024 rule out **ElGamal cipher**.

### Brute Force Attack Outcomes

- Feasible brute force space between **0 and 80** rule out **Substitution cipher**.
- Feasible brute force space between **81 and 100** rule out **ElGamal and RC4 ciphers**.

### Side-Channel Attack Results

- "Attack reveals key" outcome rules out **ElGamal cipher**.

### Ciphertext Length Analysis Results

- Ciphertext and plaintext lengths equal rule out **Substitution cipher**.
- Ciphertext length greater than plaintext length rule out **ElGamal and RC4 ciphers**.

### Key Pattern Testing Outcomes

- If key pattern lengths between **0 and 50** are observed, rule out **Substitution cipher**.
- Key pattern lengths between **51 and 100** rule out **ElGamal and RC4 ciphers**.

In each section, the outcomes of the techniques allow you to systematically eliminate certain ciphers from consideration, helping to narrow down to potential ciphers used in encryption. Understanding these relationships will strengthen your ability to analyze and decipher cryptographic systems effectively.
