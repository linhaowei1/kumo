# Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to this cryptographic analysis guidebook, designed to introduce you to several key cryptographic ciphers and techniques employed to analyze and decipher them. This guide aims to make cipher analysis accessible and clear by exploring several popular ciphers and analytical techniques. Additionally, it will provide detailed guidance on using outcomes from these techniques to exclude certain ciphers from consideration. 

## Cryptographic Ciphers

### 1. Goldbach Cipher
The Goldbach Cipher is a theoretical cipher named in tribute to the famous mathematician Christian Goldbach. It is characterized by its unique encoding pattern based on mathematical sequences.

### 2. ROT13 Cipher
ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. It is a special case of the Caesar cipher and is often used in online forums to disguise spoilers or solutions.

### 3. Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts the letters in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. Itâ€™s named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private communications.

### 4. IDEA Cipher
The International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is a symmetric key block cipher well-known for its security and effectiveness. It uses a series of computationally intensive operations on blocks of plaintext to produce ciphertext.

## Analysis Techniques

### 1. Brute Force Attack
A brute force attack systematically checks all possible keys until the correct one is found. While time-consuming, it can be effective for ciphers with a small keyspace.

- **Outcome Rule:** 
  - If a brute force attack covers outcome ranges (0, 80), exclude ROT13 and Caesar ciphers.
  - If it reaches (81, 100), exclude IDEA cipher.

### 2. Entropy Measurement
Entropy measures the randomness or unpredictability within a dataset. In cryptography, it can help indicate how unpredictable a cipher's output is.

- **Outcome Rule:**
  - If entropy measurements are in the range (0, 3), exclude ROT13 and Caesar ciphers.
  - For entropy values in the range (3, 8) or (8, 10), there are no specific exclusions, indicating potential complexity beyond basic ciphers.

### 3. Key Pattern Testing
This involves analyzing the structure and predictability of key patterns in the cipher system. 

- **Outcome Rule:** 
  - For key pattern testing results in the range (0, 50), exclude ROT13 and Caesar ciphers.
  - For range (51, 100), no specific ciphers are excluded.

### 4. Block Size Analysis
Block size analysis considers the size of data segments that a cipher processes at a time.

- **Outcome Rule:**
  - For block sizes in the range (0, 64), exclude IDEA cipher due to its larger block processing capacity.
  - For sizes (65, 256), there are no specific exclusions.

### 5. Frequency Analysis
This technique examines the frequency of letters or groups within the ciphertext to identify patterns typical of simple substitution ciphers.

- **Outcome Rule:**
  - If frequencies resemble natural language, exclude IDEA cipher.
  - If they indicate substitution patterns, exclude Goldbach cipher.
  - If frequencies appear random, exclude ROT13 and Caesar ciphers.

### 6. Ciphertext Length Analysis
This involves comparing the length of ciphertext to the original plaintext. Some ciphers maintain or expand the length of the message differently.

- **Outcome Rule:**
  - If ciphertext length equals plaintext length, exclude ROT13 and Caesar ciphers.
  - If ciphertext length is greater than plaintext length, exclude IDEA cipher.

## Conclusion

Understanding these cryptographic ciphers and techniques allows us to engage in effective cipher analysis and exclusion-based decision-making. By applying these methods and considering the outcomes, cryptographic analysts can make informed decisions on which ciphers are potential candidates given a specific deciphering context. The key lies in eliminating less likely cipher candidates through these systematic techniques, streamlining the path to correct cipher identification.
