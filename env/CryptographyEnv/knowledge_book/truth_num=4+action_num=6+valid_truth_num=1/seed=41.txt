# Cryptographic Analysis Guidebook

Cryptography is the art of secure communication. Various ciphers and techniques are used to encrypt and decrypt data, aiming for confidentiality and integrity in communication. This guidebook introduces some common cryptographic ciphers and analysis techniques, emphasizing how various results from analysis techniques can help rule out specific ciphers.

## Cryptographic Ciphers

### 1. SEED Cipher
SEED is a symmetric key block cipher developed by KISA (Korea Internet & Security Agency). It uses a 128-bit key and operates on 128-bit blocks. SEED is designed for high efficiency and security and is commonly used in South Korea for various applications.

### 2. 3DES Cipher
3DES, or Triple Data Encryption Standard, enhances the security of the original DES cipher by applying the encryption process three times. It uses three 56-bit keys for an effective key size of 168 bits, offering more security than DES alone.

### 3. MARS Cipher
MARS is a symmetric key block cipher developed by IBM as a candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition. It operates on 128-bit blocks and supports key sizes from 128 to 448 bits. MARS emphasizes performance and security against different attack vectors.

### 4. Triple DES (another variant of 3DES)
Triple DES is a method of encrypting data using the DES cipher three times with either two or three unique keys. It was designed to improve upon the original DES by using multiple encryption passes to enhance security.

## Techniques for Cryptographic Analysis

### 1. Frequency Analysis
Frequency analysis examines the frequency of letters or pieces of data within ciphertext to identify patterns. If the frequency distribution resembles natural language, it may suggest insufficient security.

- **Rule-out Information:**
  - If frequencies are similar to natural language, SEED, 3DES, and MARS can be ruled out.

### 2. Brute Force Attack
This method involves trying all possible keys until the correct one is found. Its feasibility is determined by the key length and complexity.

- **Rule-out Information:**
  - For key lengths of 81-100 bits, 3DES can be ruled out.

### 3. Block Size Analysis
Understanding the block size of a cipher can provide hints about its identity.

- **Rule-out Information:**
  - For block sizes of 0-64, Triple DES can be ruled out.

### 4. Ciphertext Length Analysis
By analyzing the relationship between the ciphertext length and plaintext length, conclusions about the cipher type can be drawn.

- **Rule-out Information:**
  - When ciphertext length is greater than plaintext length, 3DES can be ruled out.

### 5. Key Pattern Testing
This involves analyzing key patterns to gather information about the cipher.

- **Rule-out Information:**
  - For key pattern results ranging from 51 to 100, 3DES can be ruled out.

### 6. Timing Attack
Timing attacks exploit variations in time taken for cryptographic operations to infer secret keys or data.

- **Rule-out Information:**
  - No specific ciphers are ruled out when timing leaks are detected or not detected.

## Conclusion

Understanding these ciphers and techniques is crucial for cryptographic analysis. By following the rule-out information based on technique outcomes, analysts can systematically eliminate impossible cipher candidates, narrowing down the list of possible ciphers. This guidebook provides a structured approach to cryptographic analysis, promoting secure communication practices.
