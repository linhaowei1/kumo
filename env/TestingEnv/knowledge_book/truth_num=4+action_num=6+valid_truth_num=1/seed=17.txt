When verifying system performance under load, it is essential to understand and differentiate between various software testing types. This guide will help identify relevant testing types by examining specific analyses and understanding which types can be excluded based on observed outcomes.

### Testing Types

1. **Compatibility Testing:** This tests how well software functions in different environments, configurations, and devices, ensuring that recent changes or configurations do not negatively affect the systemâ€™s functionality.
   
2. **Scalability Testing:** It checks the system's ability to scale up or down according to the load. It helps identify the maximum capacity of the system in terms of user load and resource usage.

3. **Load Testing:** Focuses on assessing system behavior under expected and peak load conditions. It evaluates how the system behaves when multiple users or processes access it simultaneously.

4. **Memory Bound Testing:** Examines the system's performance related to memory usage, ensuring that memory consumption is within acceptable limits to avoid performance bottlenecks.

### Analyses and Outcomes

1. **Load Testing Analysis:**
   - This analysis measures how the system handles varying levels of load.
   - Outcomes and Rule-Out Implications:
     - Load levels between 0 to 200: Rule out **Scalability Testing**
     - Load levels between 200 to 500: No exclusions
     - Load levels between 500 to 2000: No exclusions
     - Load levels between 1001 to 10000: No exclusions

2. **System Behavior Observation:**
   - Observes the stability and behavior of the system when subjected to load.
   - Outcomes and Rule-Out Implications:
     - Stable Under Load: No exclusion
     - Unpredictable Behavior Under Load: No exclusion
     - Consistent Crashes Under Load: Rule out **Load Testing**

3. **Configuration Change Impact Study:**
   - Evaluates the effects of system configuration changes on performance.
   - Outcomes and Rule-Out Implications:
     - Significant negative impact: Rule out **Compatibility Testing**
     - Minor impact: No exclusion
     - No impact: No exclusion

4. **Response Time Measurement:**
   - Measures how quickly the system responds to user requests under load.
   - Outcomes and Rule-Out Implications:
     - Response time between 0 to 2 seconds: No exclusions
     - Response time between 2 to 5 seconds: No exclusions
     - Response time between 5 to 100 seconds: Rule out **Load Testing**

5. **Resource Utilization Monitoring:**
   - Monitors how system resources (like CPU, memory) are utilized under different load conditions.
   - Outcomes and Rule-Out Implications:
     - Resources used between 0 to 70%: Rule out **Memory Bound Testing**
     - Resources used between 70 to 90%: Rule out **Scalability Testing**
     - Resources used between 90 to 100%: Rule out **Load Testing**

6. **Usability Test Feedback Review:**
   - Assesses user feedback regarding the system's ease of use during load conditions.
   - Outcomes and Rule-Out Implications:
     - Poor usability feedback: No exclusions
     - Average usability feedback: No exclusions
     - Excellent usability feedback: No exclusions

By understanding the analyses and related outcomes, testers can more accurately identify which testing types to focus on or exclude, ensuring that testing efforts are efficient and effective in verifying system performance under load conditions.
