# Guide to Identifying Software Testing Types Focused on System Performance Under Load

In the world of software testing, particularly when assessing system performance under load, understanding various testing types and analyses is crucial. We will explore how different analyses under varying conditions can help rule out certain testing types. The primary focus is on four testing types: Reliability Testing, Stability Testing, CPU Bound Testing, and Thread Testing.

## Testing Types Explained

1. **Reliability Testing**: This testing type ensures the software consistently performs its intended functions under certain conditions over a period. It's key for evaluating how often system operations result in failures.

2. **Stability Testing**: Stability testing assesses the software's ability to function effectively over a prolonged period without crashing or degrading in performance. It's essential for understanding how the system sustains operations under extended usage scenarios.

3. **CPU Bound Testing**: This looks at the system's CPU usage, aiming to ensure that the software effectively utilizes CPU resources without unnecessary consumption. High CPU usage could lead to performance bottlenecks.

4. **Thread Testing**: This focuses on the software's handling of concurrent execution threads. It ensures that multiple operations can occur simultaneously without causing issues, such as deadlocks or race conditions.

## Types of Analyses

To determine the appropriate testing approach, various analyses are conducted:

1. **System Behavior Observation**: Observes how the system behaves under load conditions.
2. **Resource Utilization Monitoring**: Monitors system resource usage like CPU and memory.
3. **Concurrency Issues Detection**: Checks for issues arising from concurrent operations, such as threading problems.
4. **Reliability Metrics Evaluation**: Measures reliability based on failure rates and error frequencies.
5. **Endurance Test Observation**: Assesses the system's ability to continue operation over extended periods.
6. **Performance Metric Evaluation**: Evaluates performance indicators such as response times and throughput.

## Exclusion-Based Outcomes

By combining these analyses with observed outcomes, you can exclude certain testing types, helping narrow down the most relevant type for given situations:

### 1. System Behavior Observation

- **Stable Under Load**: Rule out **Stability Testing**.
- **Unpredictable Behavior Under Load**: Rule out **Reliability Testing**.
- **Consistent Crashes Under Load**: (No specific exclusion, indicating potential issues).

### 2. Resource Utilization Monitoring

- **CPU Utilization Between 0-70%**: Rule out **CPU Bound Testing**.
- **CPU Utilization Between 70-90%**: No exclusions.
- **CPU Utilization Between 90-100%**: No exclusions.

### 3. Concurrency Issues Detection

- **Concurrency Issues Detected**: Rule out **Thread Testing**.
- **No Concurrency Issues Detected**: No exclusions.

### 4. Reliability Metrics Evaluation

- **Metrics between 0-10**: Rule out both **Reliability Testing** and **Stability Testing**.
- **Metrics between 11-50**: Rule out **Reliability Testing**.
- **Metrics between 51-1000**: No exclusions.

### 5. Endurance Test Observation

- **Duration between 0-2 hours**: Rule out **Stability Testing**.
- **Duration between 2-24 hours**: No exclusions.
- **Duration between 24-100 hours**: No exclusions.

### 6. Performance Metric Evaluation

- **Metrics between 0-70%**: Rule out both **Reliability Testing** and **Stability Testing**.
- **Metrics between 70-90%**: No exclusions.
- **Metrics between 90-100%**: No exclusions.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can effectively identify which testing types to rule out based on specific conditions and outcomes from your analyses. This process aids in honing in on the most pertinent testing type, optimizing your approach to verifying system performance under load.
