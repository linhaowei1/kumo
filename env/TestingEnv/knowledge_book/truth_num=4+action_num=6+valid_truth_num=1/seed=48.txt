Certainly! Below is a comprehensive guide for identifying software testing types, with a focus on verifying system performance under load. This guide describes each testing type, the analyses involved, and provides rules for ruling out testing types based on specific outcomes.

### Software Testing Types

1. **Soak Testing**: 
   - This type of testing examines the system's performance over an extended period under a moderate load to identify potential memory leaks or performance degradation.

2. **Throughput Testing**:
   - This testing type focuses on measuring the system's ability to handle a specific number of transactions or requests in a given period to ensure efficient processing.

3. **Stress Testing**:
   - The purpose of stress testing is to evaluate the system's stability and robustness when subjected to conditions beyond its normal operational capacity, such as peak load or input overload.

4. **Usability Testing**:
   - Usability testing aims to assess the ease of use and user-friendliness of an application, ensuring that the system is intuitive and accessible to users.

### Key Analyses and Rule-Out Outcomes

1. **Endurance Test Observation**:
   - Observes the system's performance over time to detect issues like memory leaks.
   - Rule-out criteria:
     - If the system performs within ranges of 0 to 2 hours or 2 to 24 hours, Soak Testing is excluded, as it suggests the test is ongoing and hasn't reached critical observation times.

2. **Spike Response Monitoring**:
   - Involves subjecting the system to sudden, significant load increases (spikes) to evaluate response and adaptability.
   - Rule-out criteria:
     - If the system fails during a spike, it implies Stress Testing should be excluded.

3. **Usability Test Feedback Review**:
   - Involves gathering feedback on user experience to pinpoint usability issues.
   - Rule-out criteria:
     - Poor usability feedback means you should exclude Usability Testing, as it identifies existing issues that need addressing.

4. **Load Testing Analysis**:
   - Measures how a system performs under expected workload levels to ensure it can handle real-world usage.
   - Rule-out criteria:
     - A load range of 0 to 200 implies the exclusion of Stress Testing, as this range does not extensively push the system's limits.

5. **Response Time Measurement**:
   - Focuses on assessing the system's response times under specified load conditions to identify latency issues.
   - Rule-out criteria:
     - If response times are between 2 and 5, Throughput Testing is excluded, indicating possible issues with the efficiency of handling requests.

6. **Robustness Check**:
   - Evaluates the system's ability to cope with errors, invalid inputs, or other unexpected conditions.
   - Rule-out criteria:
     - If the system fails under invalid inputs, Stress Testing should be ruled out, suggesting weaknesses under unusual conditions.

### Summary

This guide provides a structured approach to identify and rule out specific software testing types based on observed outcomes during various performance analyses. Recognizing these exclusion criteria helps refine the focus of testing efforts, ensuring efficient resource allocation and addressing specific performance concerns relevant to verifying system robustness and capacity under load.
