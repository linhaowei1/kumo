### Guide to Identifying Software Testing Types for System Performance Under Load

When testing system performance under load, it's essential to correctly identify the type of testing that aligns with the specific challenges your system might face. This guide will help you determine which testing types to exclude based on various analyses and their outcomes. Here, we discuss four different testing types and the analyses conducted to verify system performance under load.

#### Testing Types Overview

1. **Failover Testing**: This type assesses if the system can seamlessly transition to a backup system in the event of a failure in the primary system, ensuring continuous availability.

2. **Large Data Handling Testing**: This testing type evaluates the system's ability to process and manage large volumes of data efficiently without degrading performance.

3. **Robustness Testing**: Focuses on analyzing how well the system performs under unexpected or extreme conditions. It checks whether the system can function correctly when faced with invalid or erroneous inputs.

4. **Breakpoint Testing**: This type examines the system's behavior under stress to identify the "breaking point" where performance degrades or the system fails.

#### Analyses and Resulting Exclusions

Each analysis is associated with specific outcomes that indicate what to exclude when the respective outcomes are observed:

1. **Volume Data Analysis**
   - Measures the system's performance handling differing volumes of data.
   - **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
     - (0, 100): Exclude **Large Data Handling Testing**
     - (101, 500): No exclusions.
     - (501, 1000): No exclusions.

2. **Breakpoint Identification**
   - Identifies system threshold levels where performance issues might begin.
   - **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
     - (0, 500): Exclude **Breakpoint Testing**
     - (501, 1000): Exclude **Breakpoint Testing**
     - (1001, 10000): No exclusions.

3. **Failover Process Examination**
   - Evaluates the system's ability to continue operation through a backup system during failures.
   - **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
     - Failover unsuccessful: Exclude **Failover Testing**
     - Failover successful but delayed: Exclude **Failover Testing**
     - Failover smooth and timely: No exclusions.

4. **Stress Level Evaluation**
   - Assesses how the system performs under stress.
   - **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
     - System crashes under stress: Exclude **Breakpoint Testing** and **Robustness Testing**
     - System slows down under stress: No exclusions.
     - System handles stress well: No exclusions.

5. **Robustness Check**
   - Tests how the system handles invalid or unexpected inputs.
   - **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
     - System fails under invalid inputs: Exclude **Robustness Testing**
     - System handles invalid inputs gracefully: No exclusions.

6. **Spike Response Monitoring**
   - Observes system behavior when subjected to sudden spikes in load.
   - **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
     - System fails during spike: No exclusions.
     - System degrades performance during spike: No exclusions.
     - System handles spike smoothly: No exclusions.

By understanding these analyses and their associated outcomes, you can effectively identify and exclude inappropriate testing types, ensuring that you focus on the most relevant and beneficial tests for your system's load performance evaluation.
