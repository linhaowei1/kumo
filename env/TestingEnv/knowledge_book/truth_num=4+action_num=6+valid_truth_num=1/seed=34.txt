Software testing involves various methods to ensure that a system performs efficiently under different conditions. This guide will help you identify testing types focused on verifying system performance under load by examining various analyses and their outcomes. The goal is to rule out certain testing types based on the evaluation results of system performance and behavior. Here are the testing types, the analyses conducted, and the outcomes that influence the exclusion of specific types:

### Testing Types

1. **Environmental Stress Testing:** Examines system behavior under extreme environmental conditions, such as high temperature or humidity levels.
   
2. **Load Testing:** Assesses the system’s ability to handle anticipated user loads and measures how the system behaves under high demand.
   
3. **Memory Leak Testing:** Identifies if the system progressively consumes more memory over time, eventually leading to system degradation or crashes.
   
4. **Recovery Testing:** Evaluates the system’s ability to recover from crashes, hardware failures, or other major problems.

### Analyses and Outcomes

Each analysis focuses on a specific aspect of system performance, and its outcomes help rule out certain testing types:

1. **System Behavior Observation:** 
   - **Stable Under Load:** No types are ruled out.
   - **Unpredictable Behavior Under Load:** No types are ruled out.
   - **Consistent Crashes Under Load:** Excludes **Load Testing.**

2. **Stress Level Evaluation:** 
   - **System crashes under stress:** Excludes **Environmental Stress Testing.**
   - **System slows down under stress:** No types are ruled out.
   - **System handles stress well:** No types are ruled out.

3. **Failover Process Examination:** 
   - **Failover unsuccessful:** Excludes **Recovery Testing.**
   - **Failover successful but delayed:** No types are ruled out.
   - **Failover smooth and timely:** No types are ruled out.

4. **Resource Utilization Monitoring (CPU and Memory Usage Levels in Percentage):**
   - **(0, 70):** No types are ruled out.
   - **(70, 90):** No types are ruled out.
   - **(90, 100):** Excludes **Load Testing.**

5. **Performance Metric Evaluation (Metric Scores in Percentage):**
   - **(0, 70):** No types are ruled out.
   - **(70, 90):** No types are ruled out.
   - **(90, 100):** Excludes **Memory Leak Testing.**

6. **Response Time Measurement (Time in Seconds):**
   - **(0, 2):** No types are ruled out.
   - **(2, 5):** No types are ruled out.
   - **(5, 100):** Excludes **Load Testing.**

By examining these analyses and their outcomes, you can effectively rule out the irrelevant testing types, thereby helping you to focus on the most applicable tests necessary for ensuring optimal system performance under load conditions. This structured approach ensures your system is tested appropriately and any performance issues are accurately identified and addressed.
