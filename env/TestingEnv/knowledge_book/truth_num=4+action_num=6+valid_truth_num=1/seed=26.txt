To effectively identify and distinguish between different software testing types that specifically verify system performance under load, we'll be focusing on the following key testing types: Data Volume Testing, Thread Contention Testing, Stability Testing, and Failover Testing. Each of these testing types has unique goals and methods, but they share common concerns about how a software system behaves under stress conditions. We will also discuss specific analyses that underpin these testing types and the outcomes that lead to ruling out certain testing types.

### Testing Types Explained

1. **Data Volume Testing**: This testing type is concerned with assessing how the system manages large amounts of data. It examines the system's ability to process, store, and retrieve data without degradation in performance or loss of functionality.

2. **Thread Contention Testing**: This focuses on evaluating the system's ability to handle simultaneous operations or tasks. It looks at how the system manages access to resources and functionality when multiple threads are running concurrently.

3. **Stability Testing**: Designed to determine if the system can remain stable and maintain performance under long-lasting load conditions. It considers the system's endurance and reliability over extended periods.

4. **Failover Testing**: This type is aimed at evaluating how well the system can switch to a backup operational mode (or secondary system) when a failure occurs. It tests how seamlessly and effectively a failover process is handled.

### Analyses and Their Implications

1. **Performance Metric Evaluation**:
   - Concerned with assessing the system's performance metrics under load.
   - Outcome: If performance falls between 0-70%, Stability Testing is ruled out. If performance is higher, no types are ruled out.

2. **Volume Data Analysis**:
   - Analyzes the system's ability to handle varying data volumes.
   - Outcome: If data volume is between 0-100, rule out Data Volume Testing. Higher volumes do not rule out any types.

3. **Failover Process Examination**:
   - Evaluates the effectiveness of the system's failover process.
   - Outcome: If failover is unsuccessful or delayed, rule out Failover Testing. A smooth failover does not rule out any testing types.

4. **System Behavior Observation**:
   - Observes the system's behavior under load conditions.
   - Outcome: Stable behavior under load rules out Thread Contention Testing and Stability Testing. Unpredictable or consistently crashing behavior does not rule out any types.

5. **Reliability Metrics Evaluation**:
   - Focuses on assessing the system's reliability metrics.
   - Outcome: With reliability metrics between 0-10, rule out Stability Testing. Higher metrics do not rule out any types.

6. **Endurance Test Observation**:
   - Evaluates the system's ability to endure prolonged periods of load.
   - Outcome: If the system can sustain load between 0-2 hours, rule out Stability Testing. Longer endurance does not rule out any types.

### Summarizing the Rule-Out Conditions

The process of ruling out certain testing types based on the outcomes of specific analyses ensures that the relevant testing type is correctly identified:

- **Performance Metric Evaluation** between 0-70% rules out Stability Testing.
- **Data Volume Analysis** for 0-100 volume rules out Data Volume Testing.
- In **Failover Process Examination**, unsuccessful or delayed failover rules out Failover Testing.
- **Stable System Behavior Under Load** rules out both Thread Contention Testing and Stability Testing.
- Reliability metrics evaluation between 0-10 rules out Stability Testing.
- **Endurance Test Observation** for 0-2 hours endurance rules out Stability Testing.

This clear framework allows testers to systematically deduce which specific load-focused testing types should not be considered under each scenario, sharpening the focus on correctly identifying the necessary testing regime for comprehensive system performance validation.
