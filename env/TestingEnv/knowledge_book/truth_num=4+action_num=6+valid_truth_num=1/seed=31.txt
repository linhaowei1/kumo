To understand and identify the appropriate software testing types for verifying system performance under load, we can focus on the following testing types and analyses:

### Testing Types

1. **Thread Testing**: This test assesses how well a system can manage multiple threads running simultaneously, targeting issues that may arise with concurrency.

2. **CPU Bound Testing**: This focuses on understanding the system's performance when the processor is the limiting factor. It evaluates how efficiently the CPU resources are utilized.

3. **Scalability Testing**: This determines if the system can handle increased loads, such as user count or data volume, without degrading performance.

4. **Resource Utilization Testing**: This test evaluates how efficiently the system uses its resources (CPU, memory, etc.) under load to ensure they are not over- or under-utilized.

### Analyses

1. **Resource Utilization Monitoring**: This analysis observes how system resources are being used during tests. Based on the resource utilization:
   - **0% to 70% utilization**: Rule out **CPU Bound Testing** as performance is not heavily tied to CPU usage.
   - **70% to 90% utilization**: Rule out **Resource Utilization Testing** and **Scalability Testing** as no issues identified suggest these tests are less relevant.
   - **90% to 100% utilization**: No specific types are ruled out.

2. **Concurrency Issues Detection**: This checks if problems arise when multiple operations occur simultaneously.
   - If **Concurrency issues** are detected, rule out **Thread Testing** because it specifically targets these problems.
   - If no issues are detected, no types are ruled out.

3. **Load Testing Analysis**: This examines the system's behavior under various loads.
   - **0 to 200 units of load**: Scalability is not a concern, so **Scalability Testing** is ruled out.
   - **200 to 500 units**: No types are ruled out.
   - **500 to 2000 units**: No types are ruled out.
   - **1001 to 10000 units**: No types are ruled out.

4. **System Behavior Observation**: Observes how stable the system remains under load.
   - **Stable Under Load**: No types are ruled out, indicating reliability across tests.
   - **Unpredictable Behavior Under Load**: No types are ruled out, suggesting further investigation is needed.
   - **Consistent Crashes Under Load**: No types are ruled out, indicating potential for uncovering various issues.

5. **Configuration Change Impact Study**: Analyzes the effect of configuration changes on performance.
   - **Significant negative impact**: No types are ruled out.
   - **Minor impact**: No types are ruled out.
   - **No impact**: No types are ruled out.

6. **Stress Level Evaluation**: Evaluates system performance under peak stress conditions.
   - **System crashes under stress**: No tests are ruled out, signifying broad testing applicability.
   - **System slows down under stress**: No tests are ruled out, indicating need for performance optimization.
   - **System handles stress well**: No test types need to be ruled out, showing robustness.

In summary, the guide is structured to help rule out irrelevant testing types under specific observed outcomes, thus refining the focus on necessary testing efforts. Each analysis area provides conditions under which certain types are not applicable, ensuring targeted and effective testing strategies are deployed.
