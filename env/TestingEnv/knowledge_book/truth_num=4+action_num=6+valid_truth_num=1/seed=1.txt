To effectively assess system performance under load, it's crucial to select appropriate software testing types based on observed analyses and their outcomes. This guide will help identify which testing types should be excluded when specific outcomes are observed, making it easier to pinpoint the most relevant tests for your objectives.

### Testing Types Overview

1. **Scalability Limit Testing**: This type of testing evaluates how well a system can scale by adding more users or workload. It helps identify the point where the system fails to handle further load.

2. **CPU Bound Testing**: This testing examines scenarios where the CPU is the primary limiting factor, ensuring that the system performs smoothly without being bottlenecked by processing power.

3. **Recovery Testing**: This testing assesses a system's ability to recover from failures, ensuring that it can return to a normal operating state after encountering issues.

4. **Thread Contention Testing**: This testing focuses on scenarios where multiple threads are competing for resources, evaluating how well the system manages simultaneous operations.

### Analyses and Their Rule-Out Outcomes

1. **System Behavior Observation**:
   - **Stable Under Load**:
     - Rule-Out: Thread Contention Testing
   
   - **Unpredictable Behavior Under Load**:
     - Rule-Out: None
   
   - **Consistent Crashes Under Load**:
     - Rule-Out: None

   > *Analysis of system behavior helps determine how well the system remains functional when under load, focusing on stability and predictability.*

2. **Resource Utilization Monitoring**:
   - **Resource Usage (0-70%)**:
     - Rule-Out: CPU Bound Testing
   
   - **Resource Usage (70-90%)**:
     - Rule-Out: None
   
   - **Resource Usage (90-100%)**:
     - Rule-Out: None

   > *Monitoring resource utilization provides insights on whether the system has adequate resources (CPU, memory) for its operations without being overstressed.*

3. **Failover Process Examination**:
   - **Failover Unsuccessful**:
     - Rule-Out: Recovery Testing
   
   - **Failover Successful but Delayed**:
     - Rule-Out: None
   
   - **Failover Smooth and Timely**:
     - Rule-Out: None

   > *Examining the failover process determines how effectively the system can switch to backup resources or systems during failures.*

4. **Response Time Measurement**:
   - **Response Time (0-2 seconds)**:
     - Rule-Out: None
   
   - **Response Time (2-5 seconds)**:
     - Rule-Out: Scalability Limit Testing
   
   - **Response Time (5-100 seconds)**:
     - Rule-Out: None

   > *Response time measurement helps assess system response under load, indicating potential scalability issues.*

5. **Performance Metric Evaluation**:
   - **Performance (90-100% of expected metrics)**:
     - Rule-Out: None
   
   - **Performance (70-90% of expected metrics)**:
     - Rule-Out: Scalability Limit Testing
   
   - **Performance (0-70% of expected metrics)**:
     - Rule-Out: None

   > *This evaluation verifies if a system is meeting its performance targets under load, which is crucial for ensuring efficient operation.*

6. **Robustness Check**:
   - **System Fails Under Invalid Inputs**:
     - Rule-Out: None
   
   - **System Handles Invalid Inputs Gracefully**:
     - Rule-Out: None

   > *Robustness checks focus on how the system manages unexpected or incorrect inputs, ensuring it remains stable and reliable.*

By observing these analyses and their associated outcomes, you can methodically rule out testing types that are confirmed irrelevant, streamlining your testing process to focus on the most pertinent areas for improving system performance under load. This approach ensures both clarity in problem-solving and efficiency in test execution.
