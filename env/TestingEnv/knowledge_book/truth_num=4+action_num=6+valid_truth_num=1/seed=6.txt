This guide is designed to help you identify which software testing types should be ruled out when verifying a system's performance under load. We will focus on four main testing types: Large Data Handling Testing, Configuration Testing, Capacity Testing, and Reliability Testing. Each of these testing types is associated with specific analyses, and the outcomes of these analyses will help in ruling out certain testing types.

**Testing Types:**

1. **Large Data Handling Testing**: This testing type assesses how well a system manages and processes vast amounts of data. The goal is to ensure data integrity and performance when handling large datasets.

2. **Configuration Testing**: This involves verifying that a system performs efficiently under different configuration settings, ensuring that there are no crashes or unexpected behavior.

3. **Capacity Testing**: Capacity testing determines the maximum load a system can handle before its performance becomes unacceptable. It helps in identifying bottlenecks and ensures scalability.

4. **Reliability Testing**: The focus here is on evaluating the system's dependability under sustained load, ensuring it consistently performs without failure.

**Analyses and Rule-Out Outcomes:**

1. **System Behavior Observation**:
   - **Stable Under Load**: No testing types are ruled out.
   - **Unpredictable Behavior Under Load**: Rule out Reliability Testing.
   - **Consistent Crashes Under Load**: Rule out Configuration Testing.

2. **Resource Utilization Monitoring**:
   - When resource utilization is between **0% and 70%**, no testing types are ruled out.
   - Between **70% and 90%**, no testing types are ruled out.
   - Between **90% and 100%**, rule out Capacity Testing.

3. **Reliability Metrics Evaluation**:
   - When reliability metrics are between **0 and 10**, rule out Reliability Testing.
   - Between **11 and 50**, rule out Reliability Testing.
   - Between **51 and 1000**, no testing types are ruled out.

4. **Performance Metric Evaluation**:
   - Between **90 and 100**, no testing types are ruled out.
   - Between **70 and 90**, no testing types are ruled out.
   - Between **0 and 70**, rule out Reliability Testing.

5. **Response Time Measurement**:
   - Between **0 and 2** seconds, no testing types are ruled out.
   - Between **2 and 5** seconds, no testing types are ruled out.
   - Between **5 and 100** seconds, rule out Capacity Testing.

6. **Volume Data Analysis**:
   - Between **0 and 100** units, rule out Large Data Handling Testing.
   - Between **101 and 500** units, no testing types are ruled out.
   - Between **501 and 1000** units, no testing types are ruled out.

By following these analyses and their corresponding outcomes, you can systematically eliminate certain testing types from consideration, focusing your attention on those most likely relevant to verifying your system's performance under load. This approach ensures thorough examination and effective resource allocation during the testing process.
