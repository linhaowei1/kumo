# Extraterrestrial Mineral Identification Guidebook

This guidebook aims to assist in identifying four intriguing extraterrestrial minerals: Tranquillityite, Florenskyite, Pyroxene, and Schreibersite. The identification process involves a series of advanced scientific tests to rule out possibilities, helping you pinpoint the specific mineral in question. Below, we outline each mineral, the tests performed, and the outcomes that rule out certain minerals.

## Extraterrestrial Minerals Overview

1. **Tranquillityite**: This mineral is known for its complex structure and presence in lunar rocks. It is typically identified through distinct phase transitions and unique vibrational modes.

2. **Florenskyite**: This mineral often presents a monoclinic crystal structure and has notable spectral characteristics, which are crucial in identifying it from other minerals.

3. **Pyroxene**: Recognized for its cubic crystal structure, Pyroxene is a common mineral in terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments. It is distinguished by electron nanostructure analysis.

4. **Schreibersite**: Schreibersite features prominently in metallic meteorites and is identifiable through its hexagonal crystal structure and unique bonding types.
