# Guidebook for Identifying Extraterrestrial Minerals

This guidebook will help you identify four fascinating extraterrestrial minerals: Stishovite, Majorite, Moissanite, and Allendeite. To conduct your analysis, we will employ six scientific tests, exploring how their outcomes can help us exclude certain minerals from consideration.

## Extraterrestrial Minerals

### Stishovite
A high-pressure, dense form of silica, Stishovite is unique for its distinct crystalline structure and forms under extreme conditions, such as in meteoritic impacts. 

### Majorite
Majorite is a type of garnet found in the Earth's mantle, known for its complex silicate compositions and high-pressure formation.

### Moissanite
Moissanite is a rare, naturally occurring silicon carbide, typically found in meteorites. It is valued for its hardness and optical properties, closely resembling diamond.

### Allendeite
Allendeite is an exotic mineral discovered in the Allende meteorite, notable for its unique elemental makeup and structural properties.

## Analytical Tests

### 1. Electron Microprobe Analysis
Electron Microprobe Analysis provides insights into the elemental composition and micro-scale chemical properties of minerals.

- **Elemental Composition:** If observed, Moissanite and Allendeite can be ruled out.
- **Chemical Bonding:** When identified, Stishovite can be excluded.
- **Mineral Identification:** The presence of indications here excludes Majorite.
- **Surface Structure:** Allendeite is ruled out upon observing surface structure characteristics.

### 2. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
TEM allows for high-resolution imagery and electron diffraction patterns, facilitating detailed examination of mineral nanostructures.

- **Atomic Resolution Imaging:** If used, eliminates Moissanite as a candidate.
- **Electron Diffraction Patterns:** If identified, Allendeite can be excluded.
- **Nanostructure Characterization:** Indicates the exclusion of Majorite and Stishovite.

### 3. Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
FTIR identifies functional groups and examines molecular bonds through absorption of infrared light.

- **Functional Group Identification:** If functional groups are identified, Moissanite and Allendeite are excluded.

### 4. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
SEM examines mineral surface morphology, providing insights into textural and compositional attributes.

- **Surface Morphology:** Rules out Moissanite and Allendeite if observed.
- **Crystallographic Texture:** Indicates the rule-out of Majorite and Stishovite when detected.

### 5. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
TGA studies the stability and decomposition of materials as they are heated, highlighting responses like mass loss or phase transition.

- **Thermal Stability:** Observations lead to excluding Moissanite.
- **Phase Transition Temperature:** With this, Stishovite is ruled out.
- **Decomposition Kinetics:** If decomposition characteristics are noted, exclude Allendeite.

### 6. Raman Spectroscopy
Raman Spectroscopy identifies vibrational modes within a mineral, revealing insights into crystallography and molecular structures.

- **Vibrational Modes:** When these modes are observed, Moissanite can be eliminated as a possibility.

In conclusion, by carefully analyzing each test's outcomes, you can narrow down which mineral is present based on what you can rule out. This method allows for precise identification by excluding non-matching minerals based on specific characteristics or behaviors observed through advanced analytical techniques.
