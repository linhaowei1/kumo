# **Extraterrestrial Mineral Identification Guidebook**

## Introduction
Welcome to the guidebook for extraterrestrial mineral identification! Within it, we will cover four intriguing minerals: Ferrosilite, Osbornite, Suessite, and Allendeite. Furthermore, we will outline six analytical tests—X-ray diffraction analysis, Raman Spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Isotopic ratio mass spectrometry, Electron Microprobe Analysis, and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)—explaining how these tests can help rule out certain minerals based on their unique outcomes.

## Extraterrestrial Minerals

1. **Ferrosilite**: A mineral that exhibits specific chemistry and physical forms, playing an important role in excluding it through various laboratory tests, focusing on crystalline structures and defects.

2. **Osbornite**: Known for its distinct chemical properties and crystal structures, this mineral can be ruled out through specific diffraction and spectroscopy outcomes.

3. **Suessite**: Characterized by unique monoclinic crystalline features, Suessite’s exclusion can be primarily guided by its structural tests.

4. **Allendeite**: With distinctive elemental and surface characteristics, Allendeite can be ruled out through imaging and isotopic analysis outcomes.
