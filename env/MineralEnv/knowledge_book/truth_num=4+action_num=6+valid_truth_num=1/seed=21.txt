## Extraterrestrial Mineral Identification Guidebook

Welcome to this comprehensive guidebook designed to help you identify and understand some fascinating extraterrestrial minerals using a series of advanced scientific tests. In this handbook, we present four unique minerals - **Cohenite, Taenite, Pyroxene, and Tranquillityite** - and describe how you can distinguish these using a systematic approach involving various analytical techniques. Each technique reveals specific characteristics that help rule out certain minerals, refining your search to accurately identify the mineral in question.

### Extraterrestrial Minerals

1. **Cohenite**: Known for its hexagonal crystal structure, Cohenite is a mineral often associated with meteorites.

2. **Taenite**: This mineral features a hexagonal structure and is characterized by its spectral characteristics. It is often found in metallic meteorites.

3. **Pyroxene**: A mineral commonly found in volcanic rocks, Pyroxene displays a cubic crystal structure and unique isotopic ratios.

4. **Tranquillityite**: Discovered on the Moon, Tranquillityite has a distinguishing monoclinic crystal structure and specific decomposition kinetics.

### Tests and Their Outcomes

Below are detailed descriptions of analytical tests you can employ to identify extraterrestrial minerals, along with how these tests help rule out certain candidates.

#### 1. Raman Spectroscopy

- **Vibrational Modes**: If these modes are observed, **Tranquillityite** should be ruled out.

- **Crystal Symmetry and Defects**: Observing these characteristics indicates you should rule out **Cohenite**.

- **Spectral Characteristics**: If these are present, you can rule out **Taenite** from your list.

#### 2. Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)

- **Absorption Peaks**: Should these be observed, **Cohenite** is not the mineral you're looking at.

- **Bonding Types**: Observing bonding types suggests you eliminate **Taenite** from possibilities.

- **Phase Transitions**: Presence of phase transitions means you should rule out **Tranquillityite**.

#### 3. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)

- **Phase Transition Temperature**: If this property is noted, eliminate **Pyroxene** as a candidate.

- **Decomposition Kinetics**: Observing decomposition kinetics suggests ruling out **Tranquillityite**.

#### 4. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

- **Atomic Resolution Imaging**: If this is successfully performed, rule out **Taenite**.

- **Nanostructure Characterization**: Observing this characteristic suggests excluding **Pyroxene**.

#### 5. Isotopic Ratio Mass Spectrometry

- **Isotopic Ratio Range (0.0, 0.01)**: If detected, rule out **Pyroxene**.

- **Isotopic Ratio Range (0.01, 0.1)**: Observing this range means **Taenite** should be ruled out.

- **Isotopic Ratio Range (1.0, 10.0)**: If in this range, exclude **Tranquillityite** from your considerations.

#### 6. X-ray Diffraction Analysis

- **Cubic Crystal Structure**: Observing this structure signals you should rule out **Pyroxene**.

- **Hexagonal Crystal Structure**: Detection of this structure means ruling out **Taenite** and **Cohenite**.

- **Monoclinic Crystal Structure**: Observing a monoclinic structure excludes **Tranquillityite**.

### Conclusion

Through this careful application of varied advanced mineral identification tests, this guide provides a clear step-by-step procedure to exclude certain minerals upon obtaining specific test outcomes.
