# Software Development Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook aims to provide a comprehensive overview of various coding paradigms and analysis techniques, offering valuable insights into their characteristics and applications. Each analysis technique will be discussed in the context of determining the exclusion of certain coding paradigms based on observed outcomes, aiding developers in making informed decisions during the software development process.

## Coding Paradigms

### 1. Lazy Evaluation Paradigms
Lazy evaluation is a strategy that delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is actually needed. This is beneficial in optimizing the performance of programs by avoiding unnecessary calculations and memory usage.

### 2. Constraint Programming
Constraint programming is a method used for solving combinatorial problems by stating the constraints (conditions) that need to be satisfied. This paradigm is particularly useful for problems where a feasible solution needs to meet a set of restrictions.

### 3. Array Programming
Array programming is a style that heavily relies on operations over entire arrays or matrices. It allows for concise and expressive code, typically used in mathematical and scientific computations.

### 4. Event-Driven Programming
Event-driven programming centers around the occurrence of events (e.g., user actions, sensor outputs) to determine the flow of a program. This paradigm is commonly found in user interface design, where the program reacts to inputs from users.

## Analysis Techniques

### 1. Detecting Event Listeners
This technique involves identifying the event listeners within a system. It can yield the following outcomes:
- **Extensive Event Listeners**: Few or no paradigms can be ruled out based on extensive listeners alone.
- **Limited Event Listeners**: Rules out **Event-Driven Programming** since it requires numerous event listeners for its functionality.
- **No Event Listeners**: Similarly rules out **Event-Driven Programming** due to its dependence on event handling.

### 2. Measuring Cyclomatic Complexity
Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program, indicating its complexity. It can result in:
- **Complexity 0 to 5**: No paradigms are ruled out.
- **Complexity 6 to 15**: Rules out **Constraint Programming**, which tends to involve higher complexity due to intricate constraints.
- **Complexity 16 to 100**: No paradigms are excluded at this level.

### 3. Calculating Lines of Code per Function
This technique assesses how many lines of code (LOC) are used within individual functions and can have these implications:
- **LOC per Function 0 to 20**: No paradigms ruled out.
- **LOC per Function 21 to 100**: Rules out **Array Programming**, as array programming generally leads to concise code with fewer lines per function.
- **LOC per Function 101 to 1000**: No paradigms excluded at this higher line count.

### 4. Detecting Lazy Evaluation
This analysis seeks to identify the presence or absence of lazy evaluation:
- **Lazy Evaluation Present**: Does not rule out any paradigms.
- **Strict Evaluation**: Rules out **Lazy Evaluation Paradigms**, which depend on lazy evaluation techniques.
- **Mixed Evaluation**: No paradigms are excluded under this state.

### 5. Checking for Pattern Matching
This technique involves verifying whether pattern matching is used in the code. It results in:
- **Pattern Matching Used**: No paradigms are excluded.
- **No Pattern Matching**: Does not specifically rule out any paradigms.

### 6. Evaluating Type Inference
Type inference refers to the automatic detection of the data type of an expression:
- **Strong Type Inference**: No paradigms are ruled out.
- **Weak or No Type Inference**: No paradigms are excluded based on weak type inference alone.
- **Mixed Typing**: Does not rule out any coding paradigm by itself.

## Conclusion
This guidebook provides a structured approach to utilizing analysis techniques for ruling out certain coding paradigms based on observed outcomes. By understanding these relationships, developers can better navigate the complexities of software design and development, ensuring a suitable choice of paradigms aligned with their project requirements.
