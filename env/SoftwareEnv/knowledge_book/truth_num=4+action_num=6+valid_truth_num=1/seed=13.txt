# Software Development Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to introduce you to various coding paradigms and analysis techniques. By understanding and applying these concepts, you can improve your software development practices effectively.

## Coding Paradigms

Coding paradigms are essential patterns of programming that guide developers in constructing software. Here’s a brief introduction to some widely recognized paradigms:

1. **Template Metaprogramming**: This paradigm involves generating code from templates, typically during the compile-time. It leverages the power of templates in languages like C++ to perform computations and generate optimized code paths.

2. **Class-Based Programming**: This object-oriented paradigm is centered around the use of classes as blueprints for creating objects. Classes encapsulate data and functions, promoting reuse and modularity in software design.

3. **Imperative Programming**: This paradigm is characterized by programming with explicit statements that change a program’s state. It resembles a sequence of commands for the computer to follow, focusing on how tasks are accomplished.

4. **Iterative Programming**: This paradigm repeatedly executes a set of instructions using loops (such as for, while, etc.). It's often used in algorithms to achieve repetitive tasks without recursion.

## Analysis Techniques

Analyzing code helps in understanding the characteristics and effectiveness of your programming approach. Here are a few techniques:

1. **Checking for Monads**: Monads are design patterns used to handle program-wide concerns such as state or I/O in functional programming. Checking for monads helps determine if the programming structure follows or varies from purely functional paradigms.

2. **Calculating Lines of Code per Function**: This analysis measures the size and complexity of your functions, helping identify overly complex or simplified functions that might need refactoring.

3. **Measuring Recursion Depth**: This technique analyzes how deep the recursion goes in your code. It can help identify efficiency issues or logic that's too complex for iterative solutions.

4. **Assessing State Mutability**: This involves analyzing how state changes occur within the program—whether states are predominantly immutable or highly mutable.

5. **Examining Higher-Order Functions**: This analysis checks for the presence and utility of functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results, a common trait in functional programming.

6. **Examining Tail Recursion**: This focuses on identifying if functions employ tail calls, which can be optimized by the compiler to improve performance, typical in functional paradigms.

## Outcomes and Exclusion Rules

When analyzing your software, it’s crucial to identify which paradigms are not in use based on certain outcomes observed during analysis. Here's how various outcomes can rule out certain paradigms:

1. **Checking for Monads**
   - **Monads Present**: Rules out **Imperative Programming**.
   - **No Monads Detected**: No paradigms are excluded.

2. **Calculating Lines of Code per Function**
   - **0-20 Lines**: Rules out **Template Metaprogramming**.
   - **21-100 Lines**: No paradigms are excluded.
   - **101-1000 Lines**: No paradigms are excluded.

3. **Measuring Recursion Depth**
   - **0-5 Depth**: No paradigms are excluded.
   - **6-20 Depth**: Rules out **Iterative Programming**.

4. **Assessing State Mutability**
   - **Predominantly Immutable State**: Rules out **Imperative Programming**.
   - **Mixed Mutability**: No paradigms are excluded.
   - **Highly Mutable State**: No paradigms are excluded.

5. **Examining Higher-Order Functions**
   - **Frequent Higher-Order Functions**: Rules out **Imperative Programming**.
   - **Rare Higher-Order Functions**: No paradigms are excluded.
   - **No Higher-Order Functions**: No paradigms are excluded.

6. **Examining Tail Recursion**
   - **Extensive Tail Recursion**: Rules out **Imperative Programming**.
   - **Limited Tail Recursion**: No paradigms are excluded.
   - **No Tail Recursion**: No paradigms are excluded.

By systematically identifying and understanding the paradigms not employed based on your analysis, you can streamline your approach to software development, ensuring more structured, efficient, and maintainable code.
