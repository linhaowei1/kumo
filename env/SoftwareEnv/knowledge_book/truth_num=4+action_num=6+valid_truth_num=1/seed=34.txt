# Software Development Analysis Guidebook

In the realm of software development, understanding various coding paradigms and analysis techniques is crucial for creating efficient, readable, and maintainable code. This guidebook introduces four coding paradigms and six analysis techniques, providing insights into how these elements relate to one another. 

## Coding Paradigms

1. **Prototype-Based Programming**: 
   - This paradigm primarily revolves around the concept of utilizing prototypes rather than classes for object creation and inheritance. It emphasizes object cloning and lends itself to dynamic inheritance hierarchies.
  
2. **Pure Functional Programming**: 
   - Characterized by the use of pure functions, which avoid side effects and maintain referential transparency. This paradigm often leverages immutable data structures and frequently makes use of monads to manage state and side effects.
  
3. **Sequential Programming**: 
   - A straightforward paradigm where instructions are executed in a specific order, one after the other. It is often used where parallelism or concurrency isn't required, ensuring predictability in execution.
  
4. **Macro Programming**: 
   - Involves writing macros or code that writes other code, allowing for code abstraction and repetition reduction. This paradigm streamlines repetitive coding tasks, increasing efficiency and maintainability.

## Analysis Techniques

1. **Analyzing Class Usage**: 
   - This involves examining how extensively classes are used within the codebase. If there is minimal use of classes, Prototype-Based Programming is excluded from consideration, as it naturally doesn't rely on traditional class structures.

2. **Calculating Lines of Code per Function**: 
   - Measuring the length of functions can provide insights into code complexity and style. If functions predominantly have 0 to 20 lines of code, Macro Programming is excluded since it often generates code that remains succinct.

3. **Assessing Concurrency Usage Percentage**: 
   - Evaluates how much of the codebase utilizes concurrent programming techniques. When concurrency usage is found to be between 11% and 100%, Sequential Programming is ruled out, as it suggests a linear execution model doesn't apply.

4. **Observing Side Effects**:
   - Observing how frequently functions alter state or interact with external systems. In scenarios with controlled side effects, Pure Functional Programming is excluded as it emphasizes minimizing side effects altogether.

5. **Checking for Monads**: 
   - This technique ascertains the presence of monads, structures that handle computations represented by a chain of operations. If no monads are detected, Pure Functional Programming is eliminated, given its tendency to employ monads for managing effects.

6. **Assessing State Mutability**:
   - Examines whether the code predominantly utilizes immutable or mutable state. If a mixed state mutability is observed, Pure Functional Programming is excluded because it leans towards using immutable data structures.

## Analysis Outcomes and Paradigm Exclusions

The analysis techniques help define certain outcomes, which, in turn, exclude particular coding paradigms:

1. **Analyzing Class Usage**:
   - **Minimal Use of Classes**: Excludes Prototype-Based Programming.

2. **Calculating Lines of Code per Function**:
   - **0 to 20 Lines of Code**: Excludes Macro Programming.

3. **Assessing Concurrency Usage Percentage**:
   - **11% to 100% Concurrency Use**: Excludes Sequential Programming.

4. **Observing Side Effects**:
   - **Controlled Side Effects**: Excludes Pure Functional Programming.

5. **Checking for Monads**:
   - **No Monads Detected**: Excludes Pure Functional Programming.

6. **Assessing State Mutability**:
   - **Mixed Mutability**: Excludes Pure Functional Programming.

By understanding these correlations, developers can effectively evaluate and rule out specific coding paradigms based on code characteristics, enhancing the software development process's accuracy and efficiency.
