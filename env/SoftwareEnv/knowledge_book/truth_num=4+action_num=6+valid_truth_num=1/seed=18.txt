# Software Development Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an introduction to various coding paradigms and analysis techniques, designed to help software developers understand and analyze different programming styles. By following this guide, you will gain insight into how different paradigms can be ruled out based on specific analysis outcomes.

## Coding Paradigms

The following are the coding paradigms we will discuss:

### Imperative Programming
Imperative programming is a paradigm that uses statements to change a program's state. This style focuses on how to perform tasks with a sequence of explicit commands.

### Minimalist Programming
Minimalist programming emphasizes simplicity and reducing complexity by writing clear and concise code. It often involves using a minimal number of lines of code to achieve functionality.

### Actor Model Programming
Actor model programming emphasizes concurrent computation by using "actors" as the fundamental units of computation. Each actor is an independent entity that communicates with other actors via message passing.

### Functional Programming
Functional programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing states or mutable data. It emphasizes immutability and first-class functions.

## Analysis Techniques

The following techniques will help evaluate and differentiate between the paradigms:

### Examining Tail Recursion
This analysis checks the use of tail recursionâ€”a special kind of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in a function.

- **Extensive Tail Recursion** rules out **Imperative Programming**.
- **Limited Tail Recursion** or **No Tail Recursion** rules out **Functional Programming**.

### Detecting Lazy Evaluation
Lazy evaluation is an evaluation strategy that delays computation until its result is needed.

- **Lazy Evaluation Present** rules out **Imperative Programming**.
- **Strict Evaluation** rules out **Functional Programming**.

### Calculating Lines of Code per Function
This analysis measures the lines of code within functions to determine complexity and verbosity.

- **21 to 100 Lines** of code per function rules out **Minimalist Programming**.

### Analyzing Class Usage
This analysis evaluates the extent to which classes are used within a program.

- **Extensive Use of Classes** rules out **Functional Programming**.

### Assessing State Mutability
State mutability examines whether state variables can be altered during execution.

- **Predominantly Immutable State** rules out **Imperative Programming**.
- **Highly Mutable State** rules out **Functional Programming**.

### Assessing Concurrency Usage Percentage
This technique determines how much a program relies on concurrent operations.

- **0 to 10%** concurrency usage percentage rules out **Actor Model Programming**.

## Summary

By applying these analysis techniques to your codebase, you can exclude certain programming paradigms based on observed outcomes. This exclusion methodology helps narrow down the paradigms being used, offering clarity and understanding of the code. Understanding these relationships enhances your ability to make informed decisions about the choice of paradigms and how they affect software design and development.

By mastering these analysis techniques and understanding the paradigms, you are better equipped to navigate the complexities of software development and make sound architectural choices.
