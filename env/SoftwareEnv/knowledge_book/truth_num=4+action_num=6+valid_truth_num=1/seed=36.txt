# Software Development Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to provide an introduction to various coding paradigms and analysis techniques, elucidating their key characteristics and how they can be analyzed in a software development context. Understanding these paradigms and techniques can guide developers in choosing the right approach and efficiently evaluating their code.

## Coding Paradigms Overview

### 1. Pure Functional Programming
Pure Functional Programming emphasizes functions without side effects and immutable data. In this paradigm, computations are treated as evaluations of mathematical functions.

### 2. Eager Evaluation Paradigms
Eager Evaluation, also known as strict evaluation, involves computing expressions as soon as they are bound to variables, rather than upon their necessity. This helps avoid potential runtime surprises often seen with lazy evaluation strategies.

### 3. Meta-Programming
Meta-Programming refers to the practice of writing code that can generate or alter other code dynamically. This can be highly powerful and flexible, but it often increases the complexity of the code.

### 4. Class-Based Programming
Class-Based Programming is centered around defining the structure and behavior of entities through classes, which serve as blueprints for creating objects. This paradigm is core to many object-oriented languages like Java and C++.

## Analysis Techniques and Outcomes

We utilize several analysis techniques to study different aspects of code, helping identify which coding paradigms could be ruled out based on specific observations.

### 1. Analyzing Class Usage
- **Extensive Use of Classes**: Not applicable to ruling out paradigms.
- **Minimal Use of Classes**: Not applicable to ruling out paradigms.
- **No Use of Classes**: Rules out Class-Based Programming as it relies heavily on class definitions.

### 2. Detecting Lazy Evaluation
- **Lazy Evaluation Present**: Observing lazy evaluation rules out Eager Evaluation Paradigms, as they compute expressions instantly.
- **Strict Evaluation**: Not applicable to ruling out paradigms.
- **Mixed Evaluation**: Not applicable to ruling out paradigms.

### 3. Measuring Cyclomatic Complexity
- **Complexity in Range (0, 5)**: Meta-Programming is ruled out due to its inherent increase in complexity.
- **Complexity in Range (6, 15)**: Not applicable to ruling out paradigms.
- **Complexity in Range (16, 100)**: Not applicable to ruling out paradigms.

### 4. Observing Side Effects
- **No Side Effects**: Not applicable to ruling out paradigms.
- **Controlled Side Effects**: Rules out Pure Functional Programming as it typically does not allow side effects.
- **Frequent Side Effects**: Not applicable to ruling out paradigms.

### 5. Assessing State Mutability
- **Predominantly Immutable State**: Not applicable to ruling out paradigms.
- **Mixed Mutability**: Rules out Pure Functional Programming, which prefers immutable over mutable structures.
- **Highly Mutable State**: Not applicable to ruling out paradigms.

### 6. Checking for Monads
- **Monads Present**: Not applicable to ruling out paradigms.
- **No Monads Detected**: This outcome rules out Pure Functional Programming, where monads are commonly used to handle side effects and manage computations.

## Conclusion

This guidebook introduces the basics of analyzing software through various paradigms and techniques, assisting in identifying which paradigms might be unsuitable under specific conditions. By ruling out certain paradigms when certain outcomes are observed, developers can refine their approach to coding, ensuring it aligns with the desired attributes and performance expectations of their software. This structured exclusion approach can significantly aid in developing concise, efficient, and reliable software systems.
