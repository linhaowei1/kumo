# Software Development Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to guide you through various coding paradigms and analysis techniques, helping you understand their characteristics and how to analyze their usage in software development. We will discuss four coding paradigms: Class-Based Programming, Parallel Programming, Meta-Programming, and Macro Programming. Additionally, we will present analytic techniques that can help you evaluate the presence and extent of these paradigms in your software.

## Coding Paradigms

1. **Class-Based Programming**
   - This paradigm involves the use of classes to define the blueprint of objects. Classes encapsulate data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. A primary aspect of object-oriented programming, class-based programming emphasizes abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. **Parallel Programming**
   - Parallel programming is the simultaneous execution of multiple computations. It aims to improve performance through concurrency, where a software application executes multiple tasks simultaneously with the use of multiple resources such as CPU cores.

3. **Meta-Programming**
   - Meta-programming refers to writing programs that generate or manipulate other programs or themselves as data. It allows the creation of flexible and reusable code by enabling the program to process its behavior and structure.

4. **Macro Programming**
   - Macro programming involves the creation and use of macros, which are sequences of instructions that represent a larger set of instructions. Macros automate repetitive tasks, enhance code readability, and allow more significant abstraction levels.

## Analysis Techniques

1. **Analyzing Class Usage**
   - This involves examining how classes are utilized within the codebase. Based on class usage, certain paradigms can be excluded:
     - **Extensive Use of Classes**: All paradigms can apply.
     - **Minimal Use of Classes**: All paradigms can apply.
     - **No Use of Classes**: Class-Based Programming is excluded, as the absence of classes conflicts with its definition.

2. **Calculating Lines of Code per Function**
   - This measures the size of functions by counting lines of code. Certain paradigms can be ruled out based on function size:
     - **0-20 Lines**: Macro Programming is ruled out; typically indicative of small macros.
     - **21-100 Lines**: No paradigms are excluded.
     - **101-1000 Lines**: No paradigms are excluded.

3. **Assessing Concurrency Usage Percentage**
   - This assesses what percent of code utilizes concurrency features. Based on concurrency, certain paradigms can be ruled out:
     - **0-10%**: Parallel Programming is excluded, as it emphasizes high concurrency.
     - **11-100%**: No paradigms are excluded.

4. **Measuring Cyclomatic Complexity**
   - Cyclomatic complexity measures the complexity of a program by counting the linearly independent paths through the program's source code:
     - **0-5 Complexity**: Meta-Programming is ruled out as it usually results in simple, non-diverse control structures.
     - **6-15 Complexity**: No paradigms are excluded.
     - **16-100 Complexity**: No paradigms are excluded.

5. **Detecting Lazy Evaluation**
   - This technique detects whether lazy evaluation (deferring computation until necessary) is used:
     - **Lazy Evaluation Present**: All paradigms can apply.
     - **Strict Evaluation**: All paradigms can apply.
     - **Mixed Evaluation**: All paradigms can apply.

6. **Observing Side Effects**
   - Observes and identifies the side effects produced by a piece of code:
     - **No Side Effects**: All paradigms can apply.
     - **Controlled Side Effects**: All paradigms can apply.
     - **Frequent Side Effects**: All paradigms can apply.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides a framework for understanding different coding paradigms and analyzing software using various techniques. By understanding the characteristics of each paradigm and performing specific analyses, you can exclude certain paradigms based on the observed outcomes. This exclusion-based approach helps in narrowing down design and structural influences within a software codebase and better understanding the integrity and style of the code.
