# Software Development Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of various coding paradigms and analysis techniques, focusing on how certain states observed through software analysis can rule out specific paradigms. Understanding these relationships empowers developers and analysts to make more informed decisions.

## Coding Paradigms

1. **Managed Memory Paradigms**
   - These paradigms offer automatic memory management, often abstracting away manual memory allocation and deallocation. Languages like Java and C# are examples, where garbage collection handles dynamic memory.

2. **Macro Programming**
   - This approach uses macros, which allow developers to define concise scripts or code snippets that can be expanded into larger code blocks during preprocessing. It enhances code reusability and simplifies complex coding tasks.

3. **Logic Programming**
   - In this paradigm, developers define rules and facts, with the language engine handling the execution based on logical inferences. Prolog is a notable example, where logic is used to derive conclusions from known facts.

4. **Constraint Programming**
   - This style involves defining constraints or conditions that must be fulfilled. The programming environment then searches for solutions that meet all constraints, useful in optimization problems and scheduling.

## Analysis Techniques

1. **Analyzing Use of Pointers**
   - This technique involves examining the usage of pointers in the codebase. 
     - **Frequent Pointer Usage**: Frequent use of pointers is not compatible with Managed Memory Paradigms.
     - **No Pointer Use**: No paradigms are ruled out with the absence of pointers.
     - **Abstracted Pointers**: There is no paradigm exclusion linked to the use of abstracted pointers.

2. **Measuring Cyclomatic Complexity**
   - This metric gauges the complexity of a program by counting the number of linearly independent paths through the program's source code.
     - **Complexity (0 to 5)**: No paradigms are ruled out.
     - **Complexity (6 to 15)**: The presence of this complexity level rules out the use of Constraint Programming and Logic Programming.
     - **Complexity (16 to 100)**: No paradigms are ruled out.

3. **Analyzing Class Usage**
   - This involves assessing how classes are utilized within the codebase.
     - **Extensive Use of Classes**: This state rules out Logic Programming, as it typically doesn't focus on OOP structures.
     - **Minimal or No Use of Classes**: No paradigms are eliminated in cases of minimal or absent class usage.

4. **Calculating Lines of Code per Function**
   - This analysis measures the size of functions by counting their lines of code.
     - **(0 to 20)**: Suggests efficient use of code; eliminates Macro Programming.
     - **(21 to 100)** or **(101 to 1000)**: No paradigms are ruled out at these levels.

5. **Checking for Pattern Matching**
   - This evaluates if pattern matching is used in the code.
     - **Pattern Matching Used**: No paradigms are ruled out.
     - **No Pattern Matching**: This rules out Logic Programming, which often leverages pattern matching in its operations.

6. **Examining Higher-Order Functions**
   - The technique involves determining the use of higher-order functions, which can take other functions as parameters or return them.
     - **Frequent, Rare, or No Higher-Order Functions**: No paradigms are ruled out regardless of the presence or absence of higher-order functions.

## Conclusion

Through the careful application of these analysis techniques, developers can narrow down suitable coding paradigms, effectively ruling out those that do not fit the observed states in their codebase. This guidebook provides clarity on these relationships, streamlining decision-making and enhancing code efficiency and quality.
