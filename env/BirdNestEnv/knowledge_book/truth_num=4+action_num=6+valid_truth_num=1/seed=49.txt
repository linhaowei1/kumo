# Guidebook on Bird Nest Identification in Forests

Welcome to the bird nest identification guide for forest enthusiasts and researchers. This guidebook is designed to help you distinguish between various types of bird nests you might encounter in forested areas through a series of examination methods. The guide will focus on identifying four specific nest types: Pelican Nest, Macaw Nest, Oystercatcher Nest, and Bowerbird Nest.

## Nest Types Overview

1. **Pelican Nest**
   - Typically large in size.
   - Found near water bodies.

2. **Macaw Nest**
   - Notable for squawking calls from the birds using them.

3. **Oystercatcher Nest**
   - Can have brightly colored entrances.
   - Often located in open areas.

4. **Bowerbird Nest**
   - Distinguished by the presence of decorations such as colorful objects or shiny items.

## Examination Methods

Identifying bird nests involves careful observation and examination. Below, we outline the examination methods used to differentiate between the various nest types.

### 1. Nest Size Measurement

Measure the size of the nest to get an indication of the bird species.

- **0 to 5 units**: This size does not help exclude any specific nest type from our list.
- **5 to 15 units**: Rules out Pelican Nests. 
- **15 to 100 units**: No specific exclusion applies within this range, and further analysis is needed.

### 2. Sound Recording at Nest

Different bird species produce distinct sounds. Use sound recording devices at or near the nest to capture these sounds.

- **High-pitched chirps**: This sound doesn't rule out any of the four nest types.
- **Deep hoots**: No specific exclusions.
- **Squawking calls**: Excludes Macaw Nests from the possibilities.

### 3. Presence of Decorations

Look for any added items within or around the nest.

- **Decorations present**: Excludes Bowerbird Nests from your list.
- **No decorations**: No exclusions can be inferred from this observation.

### 4. Nest Entrance Size

Measure the size of the entrance to the nest.

- **0 to 3 units**: This does not help in ruling out any nest types.
- **3 to 10 units**: No specific exclusions.
- **10 to 100 units**: Excludes Oystercatcher Nests.

### 5. Nest Color Examination

Observe the color of the nest and its integration with its surroundings.

- **Camouflaged with environment**: Does not exclude any of the nests.
- **Brightly colored**: Excludes Oystercatcher Nests from being considered.
- **Plain coloration**: No exclusions applied.

### 6. Number of Eggs

Count the number of eggs found in the nest.

- **1 to 2 eggs**: This observation does not exclude any nest types.
- **3 to 5 eggs**: Also provides no specific exclusions.
- **6 to 10 eggs**: No exclusion applies here either.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides a structured way to identify bird nests in forests by examining various characteristics and using exclusion rules. Through careful application of the methods outlined, you can determine the type of nest more precisely and appreciate the diversity of avian habitats. Happy bird watching!
