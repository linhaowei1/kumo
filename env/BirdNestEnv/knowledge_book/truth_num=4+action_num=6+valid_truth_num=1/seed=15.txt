## Guidebook on Bird Nest Identification in Forests

Welcome to the guidebook on identifying various bird nests found in forested areas. This resource aims to help bird enthusiasts and researchers accurately determine the types of nests they encounter by employing a series of examination methods. We'll explore four primary nest types: Woodcock Nest, Parrot Nest, Kookaburra Nest, and Magpie Nest. Each nest type can be investigated using different assessment techniques to rule out possibilities and narrow down the nest's identity.

## Nest Types Overview

- **Woodcock Nest**: Typically found on the ground. Woodcocks create simple nests that blend well with the forest floor.
  
- **Parrot Nest**: Generally an enclosed spherical structure, often featuring unique materials like lichens and spider silk.
  
- **Kookaburra Nest**: Known for their size, these nests fall within a larger measurement range and are often found nestled in tree hollows.
  
- **Magpie Nest**: Distinguished by their platform shape and often adorned with decorations. Magpie nests are crafted with a keen sense for both structure and visual appeal.
