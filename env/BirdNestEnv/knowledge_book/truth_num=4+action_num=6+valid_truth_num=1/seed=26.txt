# Guidebook on Bird Nest Identification in Forests

Welcome to the guidebook on bird nest identification in forests. This guide will help you identify various types of bird nests using specific examination methods. Understanding the characteristics of nests and the contexts in which they are found is crucial for correct identification. In this guide, we'll focus on four types of nests: Pigeon Nest, Woodcock Nest, Vulture Nest, and Cormorant Nest. We'll also explore the examination methods used for identification and the outcomes that help rule out certain nest types.

## Nest Types

### Pigeon Nest
Pigeon nests are commonly found in urban areas, but they can also be located in forested areas. Their nests are generally simple, made of sticks and leaves. They may be found on tree branches or ledges.

### Woodcock Nest
Woodcock nests are typically found on the ground in forests or woodlands. These nests are well-camouflaged, often made from leaves, twigs, and other forest debris.

### Vulture Nest
Vulture nests can be located in high tree branches, cliffs, or even abandoned buildings. These nests tend to be large, using mud, saliva, feathers, and sometimes twigs or bones.

### Cormorant Nest
Cormorant nests are usually found in colonies near water bodies. These nests are often made using twigs and grasses and are reused annually. They can also have unique characteristics, such as the use of spider silk.

## Examination Methods

### Nest Material Examination
This method involves examining the materials used to build the nest. Particular materials can indicate exclusion of certain nest types:

- **Found mud and saliva**: Rules out Pigeon and Vulture Nests.
- **Found feathers and soft materials**: Excludes the Vulture Nest.
- **Found lichens and spider silk**: Excludes the Vulture Nest.
- **Found twigs and grasses**: Inclusive material, no specific nests are ruled out.

### Egg Color Patterns
This method identifies nest types based on the patterns seen on eggs:

- **Solid color**: There are no eliminations, as no nest types are explicitly linked to solid color eggs.
- **Speckled**: When eggs have speckled patterns, you can rule out Cormorant Nests.

### Thermal Imaging
This method uses temperature readings taken from the nest to eliminate certain nest types. Temperature ranges are indicators of activity in the nests:

- **30-35°C**: Does not eliminate any specific nests.
- **35-40°C**: Indicates that Vulture Nests are not present at this temperature.
- **40-45°C**: Rules out the presence of Cormorant Nests.

### Nest Reuse Pattern
By observing whether a nest is reused or newly built, some nest types can be excluded:

- **Reused annually**: The presence of a reused nest **excludes** Cormorant Nests.
- **Built new each season**: Does not exclude any specific nest types.

### Nest Size Measurement
This method involves measuring the nest size to exclude certain nest types:

- **0-5 cm**: Does not rule out any specific nests.
- **5-15 cm**: This measurement eliminates Cormorant Nests since their nests typically fall outside this size range.
- **15-100 cm**: These measurements are not specific enough to rule out any nests.

### Presence of Mud
This is an indicator of the specific use or absence of mud in the construction:

- **Mud present**: Does not specifically eliminate any nests.
- **Mud absent**: Similarly, no nest types are specifically ruled out based solely on this criterion.
- **No specific mud properties**: Cormorant Nests can be ruled out as they are often associated with mud presence.

By understanding these examination methods and outcomes, you can systematically narrow down the possible types of nests you encounter in forest settings. This guide aims to assist you in bird nesting studies and contribute to ecological knowledge and conservation efforts. Happy exploring!
