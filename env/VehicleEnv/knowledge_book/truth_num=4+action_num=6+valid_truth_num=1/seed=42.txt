# Vehicle Engine Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook serves to provide a comprehensive overview of various engine types and their associated testing methods. We specifically focus on four types of engines and several testing methods that help analyze engine performance and efficiency. The aim is to help you understand the kinds of engines being tested and to interpret the outcomes of such tests by determining which engine types can be ruled out based on the observed results.

## Engine Types Explained

1. **Hybrid Engine - Full Hybrid**:
   - Full hybrid engines use both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. They are capable of running on just the electric motor, the combustion engine, or both simultaneously. These engines are known for their fuel efficiency and lower emissions.

2. **Diesel Engine**:
   - Diesel engines operate using compression ignition and are known for their robustness and fuel efficiency. They use diesel fuel, which is more energy-dense compared to gasoline, making diesel engines particularly effective for long-distance travel and heavy-duty applications.

3. **Petrol Engine with Twincharger**:
   - A twincharger petrol engine employs both a turbocharger and a supercharger to boost power and efficiency. This setup allows the engine to have better performance across low and high RPM ranges, often resulting in improved overall engine output and driving dynamics.

4. **Petrol Engine with Start-Stop System**:
   - This engine type comes equipped with a start-stop system to automatically shut off the engine when the vehicle is idle, thereby saving fuel and reducing emissions. It restarts when the driver is ready to move again, enhancing fuel efficiency especially in urban driving conditions.

## Testing Methods

### 1. Battery Capacity Test
- **Purpose**: To measure the energy storage capacity of a battery in an engine.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **(0.0, 1.0)**: Exclude Hybrid Engine - Full Hybrid
  - **(1.0, 10.0)**: No engine types to rule out.
  - **(10.0, 100.0)**: Exclude Petrol Engine with Twincharger, Petrol Engine with Start-Stop System, Diesel Engine

### 2. Electric Range Test
- **Purpose**: To determine the distance a vehicle can travel using only its electric power.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **(0.0, 50.0)**: Exclude Diesel Engine
  - **(50.0, 100.0)**: No engine types to rule out.
  - **(100.0, 1000.0)**: Exclude Diesel Engine

### 3. Fuel Type Detection
- **Purpose**: To identify the type of fuel a particular engine uses.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Petrol**: Exclude Diesel Engine
  - **Diesel**: No engine types to rule out.
  - **Electric**: Exclude Diesel Engine
  - **Hydrogen**: Exclude Diesel Engine

### 4. Regenerative Braking Efficiency Test
- **Purpose**: To measure the efficiency of a vehicle's regenerative braking system, which captures energy usually lost during braking and stores it.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **(0.0, 12.0)**: Exclude Diesel Engine
  - **(12.0, 25.0)**: No engine types to rule out.
  - **(25.0, 100.0)**: No engine types to rule out.

### 5. Fuel Consumption Testing
- **Purpose**: To measure how much fuel a vehicle consumes over a particular distance or under specific conditions.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **(0.0, 3.0)**: Exclude Diesel Engine
  - **(3.0, 6.0)**: No engine types to rule out.
  - **(6.0, 9.0)**: No engine types to rule out.
  - **(9.0, 15.0)**: No engine types to rule out.
  - **(15.0, 100.0)**: No engine types to rule out.

### 6. Regeneration Cycle Testing
- **Purpose**: To evaluate the effectiveness of an engine's regeneration cycle, particularly in systems designed to reduce exhaust emissions.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Active Regeneration**: Exclude Diesel Engine
  - **Passive Regeneration**: No engine types to rule out.
  - **No Regeneration**: No engine types to rule out.

## Conclusion
This guidebook aims to facilitate your understanding of the relationship between various engine types and their performance on different tests. By analyzing the test outcomes, you can effectively rule out certain engine types, helping narrow down possibilities and make informed evaluations about the engine in question. Remember, this exclusion-based analysis focuses on determining which engine types are unlikely based on specific test observations.
