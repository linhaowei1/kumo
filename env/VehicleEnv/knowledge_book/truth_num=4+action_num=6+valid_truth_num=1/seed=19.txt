## Engine Types

1. **Petrol Engine**: A conventional internal combustion engine that uses petrol as its primary fuel source. Known for its availability and ease of maintenance.
   
2. **Diesel Electric Hybrid**: Combines a diesel engine with an electric propulsion system to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.
   
3. **Petrol Engine - Inline 4-cylinder**: A specific configuration of petrol engine consisting of four cylinders arranged in a straight line. This type is known for its balance of power and efficiency.
   
4. **Bi-Fuel Engine**: Can operate on two different types of fuel, typically comprising petrol and an alternative fuel such as LPG or CNG.

## Testing Methods

### 1. Alternative Fuel Compatibility Test
- **Explanation**: Evaluates whether an engine can efficiently and effectively operate on alternative fuels aside from its primary fuel.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Compatible**: When the engine is compatible with alternative fuels, the **Petrol Engine** and **Bi-Fuel Engine** must be ruled out.
  - **Not Compatible**: No engine types are excluded based on incompatibility.

### 2. Battery Capacity Test
- **Explanation**: Measures the capacity and efficiency of the battery systems, primarily relevant for hybrid and bi-fuel engines.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **0.0 to 1.0**: Rule out **Diesel Electric Hybrid**.
  - **1.0 to 10.0**: No engine types are excluded.
  - **10.0 to 100.0**: **Bi-Fuel Engine**, **Petrol Engine - Inline 4-cylinder**, and **Petrol Engine** are ruled out.

### 3. Torque Measurement
- **Explanation**: Assesses the rotational force produced by the engine. Higher torque indicates greater capability for tasks like towing and acceleration.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **0.0 to 150.0**: No exclusions.
  - **150.0 to 300.0**: **Petrol Engine** must be ruled out.
  - **300.0 to 1000.0**: **Petrol Engine** must be ruled out.

### 4. Electric Consumption Test
- **Explanation**: Analyzes the amount of electrical energy consumed by the engine during operation.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **0.0 to 15.0**: **Petrol Engine** is ruled out.
  - **15.0 to 30.0**: **Petrol Engine** must be ruled out.
  - **30.0 to 100.0**: No exclusions are needed.

### 5. Fuel Type Detection
- **Explanation**: Determines which types of fuel the engine is capable of utilizing.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Petrol**: No exclusions.
  - **Diesel**: **Petrol Engine** should be ruled out if detected.
  - **Electric**: **Petrol Engine** must be excluded when electric is detected.
  - **Hydrogen**: **Petrol Engine** is excluded if hydrogen is detected.

### 6. Cylinder Deactivation Test
- **Explanation**: Checks whether an engine can deactivate some of its cylinders to improve fuel efficiency at lower speeds.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Active**: No engine types are excluded.
  - **Inactive**: **Petrol Engine** is ruled out if cylinder deactivation is inactive.
