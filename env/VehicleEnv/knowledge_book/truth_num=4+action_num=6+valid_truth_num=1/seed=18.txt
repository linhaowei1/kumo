## Introduction
This guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of various engine types and testing methods used for vehicle engine analysis. The aim is to help you understand how different tests can be applied to these engine types, what results to expect, and how to interpret these results in terms of eliminating certain engine possibilities based on observed outcomes.

## Engine Types

### 1. Direct Injection Petrol Engine
This type of engine introduces fuel directly into the combustion chamber, optimizing fuel use and improving efficiency. It's known for quick response and better emission control.

### 2. Diesel Electric Hybrid
A combination of a diesel engine and an electric motor, this type of hybrid is designed for improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, particularly in urban driving conditions.

### 3. Diesel Engine - Inline 4-cylinder
A traditional diesel engine setup that's efficient and known for its durability and high torque output. The inline 4-cylinder refers to the arrangement of the pistons.

### 4. Series Hybrid
In a series hybrid, the internal combustion engine generates electricity which powers an electric motor responsible for driving the wheels. This setup can offer remarkable fuel efficiency.

## Testing Methods

### 1. Battery Capacity Test
This test measures the maximum amount of energy that can be stored in the vehicle's battery.

- **Observations and Exclusions:**
  - If results fall between 0.0 and 1.0 kWh, rule out *Series Hybrid* and *Diesel Electric Hybrid*.
  - Results between 1.0 and 10.0 kWh don't exclude any engine type.
  - If results are between 10.0 and 100.0 kWh, rule out *Diesel Engine - Inline 4-cylinder* and *Direct Injection Petrol Engine*.

### 2. Start-Stop Functionality Test
This evaluates the engine's ability to start and stop operations automatically to conserve fuel, particularly in idling situations.

- **Observations and Exclusions:**
  - If the system is **functional**, rule out *Series Hybrid*, *Direct Injection Petrol Engine*, and *Diesel Engine - Inline 4-cylinder*.
  - If the system is **non-functional**, rule out *Diesel Electric Hybrid*.

### 3. Fuel Injection Pressure Test
This test checks the pressure at which fuel is injected into the combustion chamber, crucial for performance and efficiency.

- **Observations and Exclusions:**
  - Pressure results between 0.0 and 1500.0 psi don't exclude any engine type.
  - If pressure is between 1500.0 and 3000.0 psi, rule out *Direct Injection Petrol Engine*.
  - Pressure results from 3000.0 to 5000.0 psi don't exclude any engine type.

### 4. Combustion Chamber Visualization
This involves inspecting the design and function of the combustion chamber via imaging techniques.

- **Observations and Exclusions:**
  - If direct injection is observed, rule out *Direct Injection Petrol Engine*.
  - Indirect injection and no combustion chamber observations don't exclude any engine type.

### 5. Hybrid System Efficiency Test
Assesses the efficiency of the hybrid system in converting energy sources into usable power.

- **Observations and Exclusions:**
  - Efficiency results between 0.0 and 50.0% and between 50.0 and 80.0% don't exclude any engine type.
  - Efficiencies from 80.0 to 100.0% rule out *Series Hybrid*.

### 6. Engine Weight Measurement
Determines the weight of the engine, which can be indicative of design and type.

- **Observations and Exclusions:**
  - Weights between 0.0 and 200.0 kg, 200.0 and 500.0 kg, and 500.0 to 2000.0 kg don't exclude any engine type.

## Conclusion
This guidebook provides a structured approach to understanding how various tests can identify or exclude certain engine types based on specific outcomes. It's important to conduct these tests thoroughly and interpret the results properly to make informed decisions regarding vehicle engines.
