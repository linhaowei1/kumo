# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook aims to introduce you to the basic chemical analysis of four key substances: Decane, Butanone, Citric Acid, and Aldehydes. Various experiments can be used to analyze these substances, and each experiment provides outcomes that help rule out certain substances. Understanding these outcomes is crucial in accurately identifying chemical substances.

### Chemical Substances

1. **Decane**
   - A saturated hydrocarbon, part of the alkane family, usually found in the derivation of petroleum sources.

2. **Butanone**
   - Also known as Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), a solvent used in industrial applications.

3. **Citric Acid**
   - An organic acid commonly found in citrus fruits, widely used as a preservative and flavoring.

4. **Aldehydes**
   - A class of organic compounds characterized by the presence of a carbonyl group bonded to a hydrogen atom.

### Experiments and Their Outcomes

#### 1. Infrared Spectroscopy

Infrared Spectroscopy is used to identify functional groups within a substance by measuring the absorption of infrared light, which causes molecular vibrations.

- **Strong O-H Stretch at 3200-3600 cm⁻¹**
  - Rules Out: Citric acid
- **Sharp C=O Stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹**
  - Rules Out: Citric acid, Butanone
- **Aromatic Overtones at 1600 cm⁻¹**
  - Rules Out: No substances are ruled out; anomalous observation.
- **Strong N-H Stretch at 3300-3500 cm⁻¹**
  - Rules Out: No substances are ruled out; anomalous observation.
- **No Significant Peaks**
  - Rules Out: Decane

#### 2. Mass Spectrometry

Mass Spectrometry helps identify compounds based on the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles.

- **Mass Range 0-50**
  - Rules Out: No substances are ruled out; anomalous observation.
- **Mass Range 50-100**
  - Rules Out: Butanone
- **Mass Range 100-200**
  - Rules Out: Decane, Butanone
- **Mass Range 200-1000**
  - Rules Out: Citric acid

#### 3. Flame Ionization Detector

Flame Ionization Detection is a technique used to detect ions formed during combustion in a flame, providing insight into the combustible nature of the substance.

- **High Response**
  - Rules Out: Aldehydes
- **Low Response**
  - Rules Out: Citric acid, Decane, Butanone

#### 4. Melting Point Determination

Melting Point Determination assesses the thermal stability and purity of a substance by identifying its melting point.

- **Melting Point Range 0-50°C**
  - Rules Out: Citric acid, Decane, Butanone
- **Melting Point Range 50-150°C**
  - Rules Out: No substances are ruled out; anomalous observation.
- **Melting Point Range 150-300°C**
  - Rules Out: Citric acid, Decane, Butanone

#### 5. Bromine Test

A qualitative test for the presence of unsaturation (double bonds) and phenols in organic compounds, determined by the decolorization of bromine water.

- **Decolorization of Bromine Water**
  - Rules Out: No substances are ruled out; anomalous observation.
- **No Reaction**
  - Rules Out: Citric acid, Decane, Butanone

#### 6. Beilstein Test

A qualitative test for halogens in organic compounds, detected by the formation of a green flame when a halogenated organic compound is heated.

- **Green Flame**
  - Rules Out: No substances are ruled out; anomalous observation.
- **No Color Change**
  - Rules Out: Citric acid, Decane, Butanone

### Conclusion

By understanding the outcomes of each experiment, one can systematically rule out certain substances when conducting chemical analyses. Each experimental outcome provides crucial data that narrows down the possibilities, allowing for the accurate identification of unknown substances within the framework of this guidebook.
