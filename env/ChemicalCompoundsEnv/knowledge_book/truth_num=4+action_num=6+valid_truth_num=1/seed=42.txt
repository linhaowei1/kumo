## **Chemical Analysis Guidebook**

This guidebook is designed to introduce you to the analysis of certain chemical substances using a set of standardized experiments. The substances we will explore are Propene, Phenanthrene, Methanol, and Xylene. By conducting specific experiments, we aim to rule out these substances based on observed outcomes. This method ensures precise identification through exclusion.

## **Chemical Substances Overview**

1. **Propene**: A colorless gas used in the production of polypropylene and other chemicals. It is highly flammable.

2. **Phenanthrene**: A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon found in coal tar. It is solid and considered hazardous when inhaled or with prolonged exposure.

3. **Methanol**: A volatile, flammable liquid alcohol used as antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and denaturant for ethanol.

4. **Xylene**: A colorless liquid often used as a solvent in the printing, rubber, and leather industries.

## **Experiments and Outcome Rule-Outs**

### 1. **Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy**

**Objective**: Measures the absorbance of UV-visible light by a sample.

  - **Rule Out**: Phenanthrene cannot be the substance if absorption is observed in this range.

- **No Significant Absorption**:
  - **Rule Out**: Propene, Xylene, and Methanol cannot be the substances if no significant absorption is observed.

### 2. **Mass Spectrometry**

**Objective**: Provides the molecular mass and structure by measuring mass-to-charge ratio of ions.

- **Observed Peak Range: 0-50**:
  - **Rule Out**: Methanol cannot be the substance if peaks are observed in this range.

- **Observed Peak Range: 50-100**:
  - **Rule Out**: No substances are ruled out in this range.

- **Observed Peak Range: 100-200**:
  - **Rule Out**: Propene, Xylene, Methanol, and Phenanthrene cannot be the substances if peaks are observed in this range.

- **Observed Peak Range: 200-1000**:
  - **Rule Out**: Phenanthrene cannot be the substance if peaks are observed in this range.

### 3. **Flame Test**

**Objective**: Identifies metal ions based on the characteristic color they emit when heated in a flame.

- **Yellow Flame/Green Flame**:
  - **Rule Out**: No substances produce characteristic yellow or green flames; thus, no rule-outs based on these outcomes.

- **No Characteristic Color**:
  - **Rule Out**: Propene, Xylene, Methanol, and Phenanthrene cannot be the substances if a characteristic flame color is observed.

### 4. **Melting Point Determination**

**Objective**: Determines the purity of a substance by its melting point.

- **Range: 0-50°C**:
  - **Rule Out**: Propene, Xylene, Methanol, and Phenanthrene cannot be the substances if melting points are observed outside this range.

- **Range: 50-150°C**:
  - **Rule Out**: No substances are ruled out in this range.

- **Range: 150-300°C**:
  - **Rule Out**: Propene, Xylene, and Methanol cannot be the substances if melting points are observed outside this range.

### 5. **Fehling's Test**

**Objective**: Identifies reducing sugars and aldehydes by the appearance of a red precipitate.

- **Red Precipitate**:
  - **Rule Out**: No substances produce a red precipitate in this test; thus, no rule-outs based on this outcome.

- **No Reaction**:
  - **Rule Out**: Propene, Xylene, Methanol, and Phenanthrene cannot be the substances if a reaction occurs.

### 6. **Infrared Spectroscopy**

**Objective**: Identifies molecular bonds and functional groups by measuring absorption of infrared light.

- **Strong O-H Stretch at 3200-3600 cm⁻¹**:
  - **Rule Out**: Methanol cannot be the substance if this stretch is absent.

- **Sharp C=O Stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹**:
  - **Rule Out**: No substances show a sharp stretch at this wavelength; thus, no rule-outs based on this outcome.

- **Aromatic Overtones at 1600 cm⁻¹**:
  - **Rule Out**: Xylene and Phenanthrene cannot be the substances if these overtones are absent.

- **Strong N-H Stretch at 3300-3500 cm⁻¹**:
  - **Rule Out**: No substances show a strong stretch at this wavelength; thus, no rule-outs based on this outcome.

- **No Significant Peaks**:
  - **Rule Out**: Propene, Xylene, and Phenanthrene cannot be the substances if significant peaks are observed.

## **Conclusion**

By carefully conducting these experiments and observing the outcomes, you can systematically rule out substances to identify the correct chemical. This guide enables a methodical approach to chemical analysis, ensuring precise and accurate results. Remember always to handle chemical substances with care and follow standard safety protocols during experiments.
