# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

## Overview

This guidebook aims to provide a straightforward introduction to the analysis of specific chemical substances through a series of experiments. By conducting these tests, you can gather data to help rule out certain substances, thereby narrowing down the potential candidates. We will focus on the following four chemical substances: Bases, Paracetamol, Methane, and Methyl acetate. The experiments available for our analysis include Mass Spectrometry, Tollens' Test, pH Measurement, Infrared Spectroscopy, Ferric Chloride Test, and Solubility in Water.

## Chemical Substances

### 1. Bases
Bases are chemical substances that typically have a pH greater than 7 and can accept protons. They are often used to neutralize acids.

### 2. Paracetamol
Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a widely used over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic. Clear analytical markers, such as specific infrared spectroscopy signals, can identify this compound.

### 3. Methane
Methane is a simple hydrocarbon with the formula CH₄. Being a gas at room temperature, it often exhibits no significant peaks in infrared spectroscopy. Its lightweight molecular structure often places it in lower mass spectrometry ranges.

### 4. Methyl acetate
This is an organic ester with the formula C₄H₈O₂, used mainly as a solvent. It can be distinguished by certain spectroscopic features.

## Experiments and Outcomes

### 1. Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectrometry is used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. The relevant outcomes are:
- Mass Range 0-50: Rules out **Methane**.
- Mass Range 50-100: Rules out no substances.
- Mass Range 100-200: Rules out **Methyl acetate** and **Methane**.
- Mass Range 200-1000: Rules out **Paracetamol**.

### 2. Tollens' Test
This classical test is used to identify aldehydes, where a silver mirror indicates a positive result.
- Silver Mirror Forms: Rules out **Paracetamol**.
- No Reaction: Rules out **Methyl acetate** and **Methane**.

### 3. pH Measurement
This test measures how acidic or basic a substance is.
- pH 0-3: Rules out no substances.
- pH 3-7: Rules out no substances.
- pH 7-10: Rules out no substances.
- pH 10-14: Rules out **Bases**.

### 4. Infrared Spectroscopy
This spectroscopy method identifies molecular vibrations within a substance.
- Strong O-H Stretch at 3200-3600 cm⁻¹: Rules out **Paracetamol**.
- Sharp C=O Stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹: Rules out **Methyl acetate** and **Paracetamol**.
- Aromatic Overtones at 1600 cm⁻¹: Rules out **Paracetamol**.
- Strong N-H Stretch at 3300-3500 cm⁻¹: Rules out **Paracetamol**.
- No Significant Peaks: Rules out **Methane**.

### 5. Ferric Chloride Test
This test is used to identify phenols, showing a color change when a phenol is present.
- Deep Purple Color: Rules out no substances.
- No Color Change: Rules out **Methyl acetate**, **Paracetamol**, and **Methane**.

### 6. Solubility in Water
Solubility tests how well a substance dissolves in water.
- Soluble: Rules out no substances.
- Insoluble: Rules out **Methyl acetate**, **Paracetamol**, and **Methane**.

## Conclusion

Through the combined application of these tests, you can systematically exclude certain chemical substances based on observed outcomes. Remember, the process here is one of elimination; by ruling out possibilities through confirmed tests, you can more accurately determine the identity of your sample. Use this guide to navigate your way through chemical analysis with confidence and precision.
