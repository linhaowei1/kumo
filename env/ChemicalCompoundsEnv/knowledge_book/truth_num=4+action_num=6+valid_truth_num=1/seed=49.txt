# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook provides a concise introduction to several important chemical substances and explains various experiments that help in their identification and analysis. With a focus on exclusionary outcomes, the guidance here will help to narrow down the presence of specific compounds upon conducting these experiments.

## Chemical Substances

### Paracetamol
Paracetamol is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic compound. In chemical experiments, it is often identified by specific functional group tests, such as the presence of hydroxyl (O-H) and carbonyl (C=O) groups.

### Hexane
Hexane is a simple alkane used frequently as a non-polar solvent in laboratories. Characterized by its lack of functional groups, it generally shows no reaction in many qualitative tests.

### Tetrahydrofuran (THF)
Tetrahydrofuran is a polar ether commonly used as a solvent. It is cyclic and lacks significant functional groups that would react in colorimetric tests.

### Phenanthrene
Phenanthrene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of three fused benzene rings. It often shows characteristic peaks in spectroscopy due to its aromatic nature.

## Experiments and Outcomes

### Mass Spectrometry
Mass spectrometry is utilized to determine the molecular weight of compounds:

- **(0, 50):** Excludes no substances.
- **(50, 100):** Excludes Hexane.
- **(100, 200):** Excludes Tetrahydrofuran, Phenanthrene, and Hexane.
- **(200, 1000):** Excludes Phenanthrene and Paracetamol.

### Bromine Test
This test assesses the unsaturation within compounds based on bromine's ability to add across double bonds:

- **Decolorization of Bromine Water:** Excludes Phenanthrene.
- **No Reaction:** Excludes Tetrahydrofuran, Paracetamol, Hexane.

### Tollens' Test
Used to test for aldehydes, this test observes whether a silver mirror forms:

- **Silver Mirror Forms:** Excludes Paracetamol.
- **No Reaction:** Excludes Tetrahydrofuran, Phenanthrene, Hexane.

### Infrared Spectroscopy
Infrared spectroscopy helps identify functional groups based on absorbance of infrared light:

- **Strong O-H Stretch at 3200-3600 cm⁻¹:** Excludes Paracetamol.
- **Sharp C=O Stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹:** Excludes Paracetamol.
- **Aromatic Overtones at 1600 cm⁻¹:** Excludes Phenanthrene and Paracetamol.
- **Strong N-H Stretch at 3300-3500 cm⁻¹:** Excludes Paracetamol.
- **No Significant Peaks:** Excludes Tetrahydrofuran, Phenanthrene, Hexane.

### Beilstein Test
A Beilstein test is used to detect halogens based on the color of the flame:

- **Green Flame:** No substances are excluded.
- **No Color Change:** Excludes Tetrahydrofuran, Phenanthrene, Paracetamol, Hexane.

### Ninhydrin Test
Typically used for detecting amino acids, it observes color changes in result:

- **Blue or Purple Color:** No substances are excluded.
- **No Color Change:** Excludes Tetrahydrofuran, Phenanthrene, Paracetamol, Hexane.

## Conclusion
This guide aids in narrowing down the possible presence of specific compounds by excluding those that show certain outcomes in various tests. This exclusion methodology helps in effectively isolating potential suspects in chemical analyses.
