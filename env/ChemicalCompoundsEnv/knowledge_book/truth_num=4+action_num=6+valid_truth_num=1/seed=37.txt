# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook is designed to introduce you to the chemical analysis of four substances: Propionaldehyde, Sucrose, Cyclopentene, and Ascorbic Acid. We will explore various experiments and discuss how the outcomes can help rule out certain substances. The goal is to provide a straightforward understanding of how each test can be used in the identification process of these chemicals.

## Chemical Substances Overview
1. **Propionaldehyde**: A volatile, colorless liquid with a fruity odor, commonly used in the synthesis of other chemicals. It contains an aldehyde functional group.

2. **Sucrose**: A common disaccharide sugar composed of glucose and fructose, widely found in plants.

3. **Cyclopentene**: A colorless, flammable liquid with a mild smell. It is an unsaturated hydrocarbon with a cycloalkene structure.

4. **Ascorbic Acid**: Also known as Vitamin C, it is a water-soluble vitamin important for many bodily functions. It has a strong antioxidant property.

## Experiments and Corresponding Outcomes

### 1. 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine Test
This is a qualitative test used to detect carbonyl groups in aldehydes and ketones.

- **Yellow or Red Precipitate**: Exclude Propionaldehyde.
- **No Reaction**: Exclude Cyclopentene, Sucrose, and Ascorbic Acid.

### 2. Infrared Spectroscopy
An analytical technique used to identify functional groups by measuring the absorption of infrared radiation at different wavelengths.

- **Strong O-H Stretch at 3200-3600 cm⁻¹**: Exclude Ascorbic Acid and Sucrose.
- **Sharp C=O Stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹**: Exclude Ascorbic Acid and Propionaldehyde.
- **Aromatic Overtones at 1600 cm⁻¹**: No substances excluded.
- **Strong N-H Stretch at 3300-3500 cm⁻¹**: No substances excluded.
- **No Significant Peaks**: Exclude Cyclopentene.

### 3. Solubility in Water
Determining the solubility can help differentiate between compounds.

- **Soluble**: Exclude Sucrose and Ascorbic Acid.
- **Insoluble**: Exclude Cyclopentene and Propionaldehyde.

### 4. Flame Ionization Detector (FID)
Used to measure ionizable substances, often in gas chromatography.

- **High Response**: No substances excluded.
- **Low Response**: Exclude Ascorbic Acid, Cyclopentene, Propionaldehyde, and Sucrose.

### 5. pH Measurement
The pH of a solution can indicate its acidic or basic nature.

- **pH (3, 7)**: Exclude Ascorbic Acid.
- **Other pH Ranges**: No substances excluded.

### 6. Fehling's Test
A chemical test used specifically for reducing sugars and aldehydes.

- **Red Precipitate**: Exclude Propionaldehyde.
- **No Reaction**: Exclude Cyclopentene, Sucrose, and Ascorbic Acid.

## Conclusion
By applying the different experiments explained above, you can systematically exclude certain substances based on their reactions and properties. This guide serves as a comprehensive tool for analyzing chemical substances, providing clear paths for identifying and ruling out potential candidates in your studies or applications.
