# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive understanding of specific chemical substances and a set of experiments used to analyze them. By performing these experiments, certain outcomes will allow you to rule out possibilities for particular substances.

## Chemical Substances

1. **Citric Acid**
   - Citric acid is a naturally occurring weak organic acid, commonly found in citrus fruits. It is known for its tangy flavor and preservative properties. In the context of chemical analysis, it falls under the category of weak acids.

2. **Nitrobenzene**
   - Nitrobenzene is an aromatic compound with a distinctive almond odor. It is primarily used in the manufacture of aniline, used for dyes and pharmaceuticals. Nitrobenzene is not soluble in water due to its aromatic structure.

3. **Weak Acids**
   - Weak acids partially dissociate in water, which results in a range of pH values from 3 to 7. Besides citric acid, other weak acids include acetic acid and phosphoric acid.

4. **Methanol**
   - Methanol is a simple alcohol, often used as a solvent, antifreeze, or fuel. It's characterized by a low molecular weight and high solubility in water, making it a useful substance in various industrial applications.

## Experiments and Outcomes

1. **Bromine Test**
   - This test is used to identify unsaturated compounds, such as alkenes, by observing the decolorization of bromine water.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - **Decolorization of Bromine Water:** Rules out Nitrobenzene.
     - **No Reaction:** Rules out Methanol and Citric Acid.

2. **pH Measurement**
   - pH measurement determines the acidity or basicity of a substance. For our purposes, the pH scale is divided into four ranges.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - **pH 0-3:** No substances ruled out.
     - **pH 3-7:** Rules out Citric Acid and Weak Acids.
     - **pH 7-10 and 10-14:** No substances ruled out.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**
   - This technique is used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. It helps to identify the molecular weight of a substance.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - **M/Z 0-50:** Rules out Methanol.
     - **M/Z 100-200:** Rules out Methanol and Nitrobenzene.
     - **M/Z 200-1000:** Rules out Citric Acid.

4. **Ninhydrin Test**
   - The ninhydrin test identifies amino acids and proteins, typically by forming a blue or purple color.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - **Blue or Purple Color:** No substances ruled out.
     - **No Color Change:** Rules out Methanol, Nitrobenzene, and Citric Acid.

5. **Solubility in Water**
   - This test checks whether a substance dissolves in water.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - **Soluble:** Rules out Methanol and Citric Acid.
     - **Insoluble:** Rules out Nitrobenzene.

6. **Tollens' Test**
   - Tollens' test is used to detect aldehydes by forming a silver mirror on the glass.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - **Silver Mirror Forms:** No substances ruled out.
     - **No Reaction:** Rules out Methanol, Nitrobenzene, and Citric Acid.

By understanding the results of these experiments, you can effectively determine which substances are not present in a given sample based on the observable outcomes. This exclusion-based approach provides clarity in identifying the composition of unknown chemical mixtures.
