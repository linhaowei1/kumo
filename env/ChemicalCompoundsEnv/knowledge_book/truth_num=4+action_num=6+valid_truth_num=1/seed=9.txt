## Chemical Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to this guidebook on chemical analysis, where we explore the characteristics of specific chemical substances using various experiments. Through this guide, you'll learn how to conduct experiments to identify properties of substances and draw conclusions based on the outcomes. We focus on four chemical substances—Cyclohexene, Weak Acids, Butane, and Carbon Disulfide—and six experiments to illustrate rule-out principles in chemical testing. 

## Chemical Substances

### Cyclohexene
Cyclohexene is a volatile organic compound and a simple alkene with the formula C₆H₁₀. It is a colorless liquid with a characteristic sweet odor. Cyclohexene is often used in the synthesis of other chemicals and in polymerization processes.

### Weak Acids
Weak acids are acids that do not completely dissociate in solution. Common examples include acetic acid and citric acid. They have a higher pH compared to strong acids and are characterized by a relatively low concentration of hydrogen ions in solution.

### Butane
Butane, C₄H₁₀, is a gaseous alkane with a low boiling point. Used primarily as a fuel and a propellant, butane is found in lighters and portable stoves. It is important to measure butane carefully for safety due to its flammability.

### Carbon Disulfide
Carbon disulfide (CS₂) is an inorganic chemical compound. It is a colorless, volatile liquid with an offensive ether-like odor, used in the manufacture of viscose rayon, cellophane film, and chemical synthesis processes.

## Experiments and Outcomes

### Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy
This technique measures the absorption of UV or visible light by a chemical substance. When applied:
    
- **Absorption at 260-280 nm**: No substances are eliminated from consideration using this specific absorption range.
- **No Significant Absorption**: If observed, Cyclohexene, Carbon Disulfide, and Butane are ruled out as possibilities.

### Flame Test
A flame test reveals the presence of certain metal ions based on the color of flame they produce.
    
- **Yellow Flame**: Observing a yellow flame excludes Butane.
- **Green Flame**: No substances are excluded based on a green flame.
- **No Characteristic Color**: Cyclohexene and Carbon Disulfide show no distinctive flame color, eliminating them from consideration.

### Infrared Spectroscopy
IR spectroscopy identifies functional groups by analyzing vibrational transitions within molecules.
    
- **Strong O-H Stretch at 3200-3600 cm⁻¹**: No substances are dismissed based on this peak.
- **Sharp C=O Stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹**: This result does not exclude any substances.
- **Aromatic Overtones at 1600 cm⁻¹**: No substances are designated for elimination.
- **Strong N-H Stretch at 3300-3500 cm⁻¹**: No rule-outs apply based on this finding.
- **No Significant Peaks**: When this result is seen, Cyclohexene, Carbon Disulfide, and Butane are ruled out.

### Ninhydrin Test
Typically used to detect amino acids, this test results in a color change when amino acids are present.
    
- **Blue or Purple Color**: No substances are eliminated with this result.
- **No Color Change**: Cyclohexene, Carbon Disulfide, and Butane are eliminated from consideration.

### Ferric Chloride Test
This test detects phenolic compounds, which react with ferric chloride to produce a color change.
    
- **Deep Purple Color**: No candidates are excluded based on this outcome.
- **No Color Change**: Cyclohexene, Carbon Disulfide, and Butane are ruled out under these circumstances.

### Bromine Test
This test identifies unsaturation (double bonds) as bromine water decolorizes in such cases.
    
- **Decolorization of Bromine Water**: Cyclohexene is ruled out when decolorization is observed.
- **No Reaction**: In cases where bromine water remains unchanged, Carbon Disulfide and Butane are ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guidebook not only outlines a systematic approach to conducting chemical analyses but emphasizes the importance of ruling out substances based on test outcomes. Each experiment provides unique insights that, when combined, assist you in narrowing down chemical possibilities. Always ensure safe handling of chemicals and equipment when performing these tests.
