# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

Welcome to the Chemical Analysis Guidebook, a comprehensive resource designed to help you understand and perform chemical analysis on various substances. This guide will cover four primary chemical substances: Nitric acid, Water, Formic acid, and Methane. We will explore the methods of analyzing these substances using different experimental techniques. For each experiment, outcomes will help determine which substances can be ruled out, aiding in identifying unknown samples.

### Chemical Substances Overview

1. **Nitric acid (HNO₃)**
   - A strong, corrosive acid commonly used in fertilizers and explosives.
   - Highly soluble in water.
   - Exhibits no significant peaks during infrared spectroscopy analysis.
   - pH is typically very low, indicating high acidity.
  
2. **Water (H₂O)**
   - Essential for life, commonly used as a solvent.
   - Has a refractive index range between 1.33 and 1.4.
   - Highly soluble in all conditions.
   - Neutral pH close to 7.
  
3. **Formic acid (HCOOH)**
   - The simplest carboxylic acid, used as a preservative and antibacterial agent.
   - Highly soluble in water.
   - Shows a sharp C=O stretch at around 1700 cm⁻¹ in infrared spectroscopy.
   - pH is low due to its acidic nature.
  
4. **Methane (CH₄)**
   - A primary component of natural gas, used as a fuel.
   - Less reactive and insoluble in water.
   - Exhibits no significant peaks during infrared spectroscopy.
   - Neutral to slightly acidic pH in solution.

### Experimental Techniques and Outcomes

1. **Infrared Spectroscopy (IR)**
   - An analysis method for identifying molecular components based on their vibrational transitions.
   - **Observations:**
     - Sharp C=O Stretch at 1700 cm⁻¹: Rules out Formic acid.
     - No Significant Peaks: Rules out Nitric acid and Methane.

2. **Solubility in Water**
   - Evaluates the ability of a substance to dissolve in water.
   - **Observations:**
     - Soluble: Rules out Nitric acid and Formic acid.
     - Insoluble: Rules out Methane.

3. **Refractive Index Measurement**
   - Measures how much light is bent, or refracted, when entering a substance.
   - **Observations:**
     - Refractive Index of 1.33 to 1.4: Rules out Water.

4. **Flame Test**
   - Used to observe the characteristic color a substance produces in a flame, often indicative of its composition.
   - **Observations:**
     - No Characteristic Color: Rules out Formic acid, Nitric acid, and Methane.

5. **pH Measurement**
   - Determines the acidity or basicity of a solution.
   - **Observations:**
     - pH between 0 and 3: Rules out Nitric acid and Formic acid.
     - pH between 3 and 7, 7 and 10, 10 and 14: Used for substances not characterized by a particular color change.

6. **Ninhydrin Test**
   - Typically used to detect amino acids. Results in distinctive coloration upon reaction.
   - **Observations:**
     - No Color Change: Rules out Formic acid, Nitric acid, and Methane.

## Conclusion

With this guidebook, you have valuable resources to effectively identify or exclude specific chemical substances through various analytical experiments. Remember that while ruling out possibilities, thorough experimental analysis can guide you closer to understanding the characteristics of your unknown sample. Happy analyzing!
