# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

In this guidebook, we will explore a set of chemical substances and conduct several experiments to understand their characteristics. The goal is to observe the outcomes of these experiments and identify which substances can be ruled out based on these observations. We will be examining the following substances: Hydrochloric acid, Dimethylamine, Pentanol, and Methanol. The experiments we will discuss are Solubility in Water, pH Measurement, Ferric Chloride Test, Fehling's Test, Refractive Index Measurement, and Flame Test.

## Chemical Substances

### Hydrochloric Acid
- **Description**: A strong, corrosive acid commonly used in laboratory settings and industry.
- **Key Properties**: Strongly acidic, highly soluble in water.

### Dimethylamine
- **Description**: A colorless gas with a strong fishy odor, often used in chemical synthesis.
- **Key Properties**: Basic, less soluble in water compared to acids.

### Pentanol
- **Description**: An organic alcohol with a slight aroma, used in organic synthesis.
- **Key Properties**: Moderate solubility in water, less polar than smaller alcohols.

### Methanol
- **Description**: A simple alcohol commonly used as a solvent and antifreeze.
- **Key Properties**: Highly soluble in water, flammable, with a sweet odor.

## Experiments and Analysis

### 1. Solubility in Water
**Objective**: To determine whether the substances dissolve in water.

**Outcomes**:
- **Soluble**: If solubility in water is observed, rule out Methanol and Hydrochloric acid.
- **Insoluble**: If insolubility is observed, rule out Pentanol and Dimethylamine.

### 2. pH Measurement
**Objective**: To assess the acidity or basicity of the substances.

**Outcomes**:
- **pH 0-3 (Strongly Acidic)**: If observed, rule out Hydrochloric acid.
- **pH 10-14 (Strongly Basic)**: If observed, rule out Dimethylamine.

### 3. Ferric Chloride Test
**Objective**: To detect phenols and enols which result in color changes.

**Outcomes**:
- **Deep Purple Color**: This outcome does not rule out any substances.
- **No Color Change**: If observed, rule out Pentanol, Dimethylamine, Methanol, and Hydrochloric acid.

### 4. Fehling's Test
**Objective**: To identify reducing sugars and aldehydes.

**Outcomes**:
- **Red Precipitate**: This outcome does not rule out any substances.
- **No Reaction**: If observed, rule out Pentanol, Dimethylamine, Methanol, and Hydrochloric acid.

### 5. Refractive Index Measurement
**Objective**: To measure how much the substances bend light.

**Outcomes**:
- **Refractive Index 1.33-1.4**: If observed, rule out Methanol.
- **Refractive Index outside 1.33-1.4**: This outcome does not rule out any substances.

### 6. Flame Test 
**Objective**: To observe the characteristic colors when substances are exposed to a flame.

**Outcomes**:
- **Yellow Flame**: If observed, rule out Pentanol, Dimethylamine, Methanol, and Hydrochloric acid.
- **Green Flame**: If observed, rule out Pentanol, Dimethylamine, Methanol, and Hydrochloric acid.
- **No Characteristic Color**: If observed, rule out Pentanol, Dimethylamine, Methanol, and Hydrochloric acid.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides an analytical approach for distinguishing between Hydrochloric acid, Dimethylamine, Pentanol, and Methanol using standard chemical tests. By focusing on what substances can be ruled out based on the observed outcomes, one can narrow down the possibilities and better understand the chemical properties of each substance. Remember, every test is part of a holistic process, and results must be considered collectively for accurate analysis.
