## **Chemical Analysis Guidebook**

This guidebook introduces you to the fascinating world of chemical analysis through a series of experiments. It will guide you on how to determine the presence or absence of specific chemical substances: Acetic acid, Salicylic acid, Pentane, and Naphthalene. We'll explore various experiments, providing insights into how each test helps to rule out certain substances based on observed outcomes.

## **Chemical Substances**

1. **Acetic acid**: A colorless liquid with a distinctive sour smell. It's commonly known as the main component of vinegar apart from water. Chemically, it's a carboxylic acid with the formula CH₃COOH.

2. **Salicylic acid**: A colorless, crystalline organic acid best known for its use in acne treatment products. Its chemical formula is C₇H₆O₃, and it's used extensively in organic synthesis and as a plant hormone.

3. **Pentane**: A colorless, volatile liquid hydrocarbon with the formula C₅H₁₂. It is one of the higher alkanes and is often used as a solvent in laboratory settings.

4. **Naphthalene**: A white, volatile, solid polycyclic hydrocarbon with the formula C₁₀H₈, known for its use in mothballs and as a precursor to other chemicals.

## **Experiments and Their Outcomes**

Each experiment outlined below will provide data that help to exclude certain substances based on the specific reactions or lack thereof.

### 1. **Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy**

This technique examines the absorption of ultraviolet or visible light by a substance.

- **Outcome: Absorption at 260-280 nm**
  - **Rule-out**: Naphthalene is ruled out when absorption is observed at this range.

- **Outcome: No Significant Absorption**
  - **Rule-out**: Pentane, Salicylic acid, and Acetic acid are ruled out when no absorption is observed at this range.

### 2. **Tollens' Test**

This test is used to identify aldehydes and involves the formation of a silver mirror on the test tube's surface.

- **Outcome: Silver Mirror Forms**
  - **Rule-out**: If a silver mirror forms, none of the substances are ruled out based on this outcome alone.

- **Outcome: No Reaction**
  - **Rule-out**: Naphthalene, Salicylic acid, and Pentane are eliminated in the absence of a reaction.

### 3. **Mass Spectrometry**

This method identifies substances based on mass-to-charge ratio.

- **Outcome: Mass 0-50**
  - **Rule-out**: No substances are ruled out in this mass range.

- **Outcome: Mass 50-100**
  - **Rule-out**: Pentane and Acetic acid are ruled out if no peaks appear in this range.

- **Outcome: Mass 100-200**
  - **Rule-out**: Pentane, Acetic acid, Salicylic acid, and Naphthalene are ruled out if no peaks appear within this range.

- **Outcome: Mass 200-1000**
  - **Rule-out**: Naphthalene is ruled out if no peaks are observed in this bandwidth.

### 4. **Fehling's Test**

This test identifies aldehydes by forming a red precipitate.

- **Outcome: Red Precipitate**
  - **Rule-out**: No substances are ruled out if a red precipitate forms.

- **Outcome: No Reaction**
  - **Rule-out**: Acetic acid, Naphthalene, Salicylic acid, and Pentane are excluded if the test gives this result.

### 5. **pH Measurement**

pH measurement assesses the acidity or basicity of a substance.

- **Outcome: pH 0-3**
  - **Rule-out**: Acetic acid is excluded if the pH measurement is not in the range of 0-3.

- **Outcome: pH 3-14**
  - **Rule-out**: No substances are ruled out with pH measurements between 3 and 14.

### 6. **Ninhydrin Test**

The Ninhydrin test is useful for detecting free amino groups, often indicated by a change in color to blue or purple.

- **Outcome: Blue or Purple Color**
  - **Rule-out**: No substances are ruled out if a blue or purple color change is observed.

- **Outcome: No Color Change**
  - **Rule-out**: Acetic acid, Naphthalene, Salicylic acid, and Pentane are ruled out without a color change.

In this guidebook, each experiment offers insights into excluding certain chemicals based on distinct reactions or lack thereof. Understanding these rules can greatly enhance your chemical analysis capabilities.
