### Musical Genre Identification Guide

This guide will help you understand how to identify musical genres based on various musical elements and analysis methods. These methods look at different aspects of music in a way that can help rule out certain genres from the possibilities of what you might be listening to. The genres we're focusing on here are Funk, Blues, Opera, and Indie.

#### Analysis Methods

1. **Lyrical Content Review**
   - This examines the themes and messages conveyed in the lyrics of a song.
     - **Instrumental** pieces cannot be conclusively categorized here.
     - **Positive Themes**: If a song consistently focuses on positive messages, it cannot be Blues.
     - **Negative Themes**: Songs with negative themes rule out Funk.
     - **Social/Political Themes**: When themes are heavily social or political, Opera is eliminated.

2. **Vocal Style Assessment**
   - This analysis reviews how vocals are delivered.
     - **Operatic** vocals mean that the genre cannot be Blues.
     - **Rap** vocals exclude both Blues and Opera.
     - **Singing** doesn't help rule out any genres.
     - **Screaming/Growling** is not found in Blues or Opera.

3. **Cultural Origin Identification**
   - This focuses on the cultural background the music might be influenced by.
     - **Western** origin is not ruled out by any specific genre.
     - **Eastern** influences rule out Blues.
     - **Latin American** origins are not exclusive to ruling out these genres.

4. **Instrumentation Examination**
   - This method examines the types of instruments used in a song.
     - **Acoustic** instrumentation does not rule out any of these genres.
     - **Electric** instrumentation excludes Opera.
     - **Electronic** sounds mean the genre is neither Blues nor Opera.

5. **Rhythm and Tempo Analysis**
   - By analyzing the speed and rhythm, we can rule out genres.
     - A tempo between **0-60 beats per minute** does not exclude any genres.
     - **60-90 beats per minute** also provides no exclusions.
     - A faster tempo of **90-150 beats per minute** means the song is not Blues or Opera.
     - An even quicker tempo of **150-300 beats per minute** also rules out Blues and Opera.

6. **Harmonic Structure Analysis**
   - This reviews the complexity of harmony used in the music.
     - **Simple Harmony** rules out Indie.
     - **Complex Harmony** isn't used to exclude these genres.
     - **Modal Harmony** suggests the genre isn't Opera.
     - An **Atonal or Experimental** style does not rule out any genres.

### Summary

By following these methods of analysis, you can effectively narrow down which musical genres a song does not belong to based on lyrical themes, vocal styles, cultural origins, instrumentation, rhythm and tempo, and harmonic structure. Remember that this guide uses the process of elimination to help you identify what you are listening to, rather than confirming a positive match with a specific genre.
