When trying to identify a musical genre, it's essential to consider a variety of musical elements and analysis methods. This guide will walk you through such an analysis with a particular focus on distinguishing between the genres of Alternative, World Music, Salsa, and Afrobeat. We will systematically examine several elements to rule out certain genres based on observed outcomes.

### Analysis Methods

1. **Lyrical Content Review**
   - This method involves examining the themes present in the lyrics of a song.
   - **Instrumental:** If the song is primarily instrumental, exclude Salsa from consideration.
   - **Positive Themes:** Should positive themes dominate, rule out Alternative.
   - **Negative Themes:** If the focus is on negative themes, Afrobeat can be ruled out.
   - **Social/Political Themes:** No specific exclusions are set for these themes based on our analysis criteria.

2. **Cultural Origin Identification**
   - This identifies the cultural background or influence reflected in the music.
   - **Western Influences:** If the music shows Western influences, rule out World Music and Afrobeat.
   - **Eastern Influences:** No exclusions are currently associated with Eastern influences.
   - **Latin American Influences:** If influences stem from Latin America, World Music and Afrobeat can be excluded.

3. **Instrumentation Examination**
   - This analysis looks at the types of instruments predominantly used in the music.
   - **Acoustic Instruments:** There are no exclusions related to acoustic instruments.
   - **Electric Instruments:** The presence of electric instruments excludes World Music.
   - **Electronic Instruments:** No genres are excluded based on the presence of electronic instruments.

4. **Rhythm and Tempo Analysis**
   - This approach focuses on the speed and regularity of the beat in the music.
   - **0-60 BPM:** If the tempo is between 0 and 60 beats per minute (BPM), rule out Salsa.
   - **60-90 BPM:** A tempo in this range also excludes Salsa.
   - **90-150 BPM:** A tempo here excludes World Music.
   - **150-300 BPM:** Similarly, this excludes World Music.

5. **Harmonic Structure Analysis**
   - This method examines the complexity and style of harmonies in the music.
   - **Simple Harmony:** If observed, rule out Alternative.
   - **Complex Harmony:** With complex harmonies, Salsa is excluded.
   - **Modal Harmony:** No genres are ruled out with modal harmony.
   - **Atonal or Experimental:** Salsa is ruled out if noted for atonal or experimental characteristics.

6. **Electronic Elements Detection**
   - This involves detecting the presence and extent of electronic sounds in the music.
   - **Heavy Use:** If electronic elements are heavily used, there are currently no exclusions specified.
   - **Minimal Use:** No genres are excluded with minimal electronic elements detected.

By methodically applying these analysis methods, you can systematically rule out certain genres and narrow down your genre identification. The aim is not to confirm but to eliminate possibilities to help focus your identification process.
