# Art Evaluation Guidebook: Analyzing Sculptures

This guidebook serves as a resource for evaluating sculptures through the lens of notable sculptors and modern analysis techniques. We will introduce four influential sculptors and explain how different technical analyses can help determine the likely creator of a piece by ruling out possibilities based on the characteristics discovered during testing.

## Sculptors Overview

### Alexander Calder
Known for his innovative use of mobiles and wire sculptures, Calder's work represents the Modernist style. He often incorporated materials like low alloy steel and, unexpectedly, marble, into his designs.

### Rachel Whiteread
A contemporary artist, Whiteread is renowned for her casts of negative spaces, often exposing internal details. Her work may reveal internal cavities, which align with her stylistic focus on examining spaces.

### Alberto Giacometti
As a significant figure in the world of modern sculpture, Giacometti is famous for his elongated human figures and abstract style. His work doesn't generally link to specific material compositions, allowing greater ambiguity in material analysis.

### Antoine Bourdelle
Bourdelle's sculptures often straddle abstract and classical elements, where detailed structures are captured accurately, exemplified by 3D models. His work may feature feldspar inclusions when mineral analysis is performed.

## Analysis Techniques and Their Outcomes

Below, we outline the techniques used in the analysis of sculptures and explain how each technique can exclude certain sculptors based on specific outcomes.

### 1. Ultrasonic Testing
Used to detect internal features of a sculpture:
- **Internal Cavities Detected**: If this result is observed, **exclude Rachel Whiteread** as a potential artist due to her typical use of solid casts.
- **Solid Structure Confirmed**: *No exclusions based on this outcome.*

### 2. Mineral Inclusion Analysis
Analyzes the types of minerals present in a sculpture:
- **Feldspar Inclusions**: If feldspar minerals are detected, **exclude Antoine Bourdelle**.
- **Quartz Inclusions**: *No exclusions based on this outcome.*
- **No Inclusions**: *No exclusions based on this outcome.*

### 3. Metallurgical Analysis
Examines the metals present to determine alloy composition:
- **Low Alloy Steel**: If low alloy steel is observed, **exclude Alexander Calder** due to his use of diverse material choices.
- **High Carbon Steel**: *No exclusions based on this outcome.*

### 4. Photogrammetry
Creates a 3D model to identify the exactness and deviation in sculpture dimensions:
- **3D Model Accurate**: If the 3D model is accurate, **exclude Antoine Bourdelle**.
- **Model Deviations**: *No exclusions based on this outcome.*

### 5. Stylistic Comparison
Evaluates the artistic style to connect it to known sculptors' approaches:
- **Modernist Style**: If a Modernist style is observed, **exclude Alexander Calder**.
- **Abstract Style**: If an Abstract style is observed, **exclude both Alberto Giacometti and Antoine Bourdelle**.
- **Classical Style**: *No exclusions based on this outcome.*

### 6. Material Composition Testing
Examines the primary materials used in the sculpture:
- **High Marble Content**: If high marble content is detected, **exclude Alexander Calder**.
- **High Bronze Content**: *No exclusions based on this outcome.*
- **Mixed Media**: *No exclusions based on this outcome.*

## Conclusion

By utilizing these techniques, one can effectively narrow down the list of potential sculptors for an unidentified work. This guidebook streamlines the process by identifying key observations that, when present, allow the exclusion of specific artists, facilitating a clearer pathway to final identification.
