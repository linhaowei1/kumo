**Transdimensional Entity Investigation Guidebook**

This guidebook serves to aid investigators in identifying and understanding transdimensional entities through a series of defined traits and experiments. Below, we delineate the traits, experiments, and the outcomes that rule out certain traits, facilitating the identification of transdimensional entities.

### Traits of Transdimensional Entities

1. **Energy Absorption**
   - These entities may possess the capability to absorb energy from their surroundings. This unique trait affects their interactions with the environment and their energetic signatures.
   
2. **Subspace Resonance**
   - A phenomenon where entities interact with subspace dimensions, creating unique patterns or resonances detectable in specific experimental setups.

3. **Spatial Overlapping**
   - This trait involves entities existing or manifesting across multiple spatial dimensions simultaneously, potentially causing overlapping of spatial coordinates.

4. **Dimensional Rift Creation**
   - Entities with this ability can create or manipulate openings between different dimensions, altering the fabric of reality around them.

### Experiments

Each experiment is designed to observe and produce outcomes that help rule out certain traits, thus narrowing the possibilities and leading to a more precise identification of transdimensional entities.

1. **Dimensional Anchor Testing**
   - **Outcome: Anchors Stable**  
     - Rule Out: *Dimensional Rift Creation*  
     - Explanation: Entities that stabilize dimensional anchors unlikely possess the ability to create dimensional rifts.
   - **Outcome: Anchors Unstable**
     - No traits are ruled out, indicating all traits remain possible.

2. **Energy Absorption Test**
   - **Outcome: Energy Absorption Detected (0.0 - 50.0)**
     - Rule Out: *Energy Absorption*
     - Explanation: If the entity does not significantly absorb energy, it likely lacks the energy absorption trait.
   - **Outcome: Energy Absorption Exceeds (50.0 - 100.0)**
     - No traits are ruled out, maintaining all possibilities for entity traits.

3. **Spatial Distortion Mapping**
   - **Outcome: Uniform Distortion**
     - Rule Out: *Spatial Overlapping*
     - Explanation: Uniform spatial distortions suggest the absence of multiple spatial manifestations.
   - **Outcome: Localized Distortions**
     - No traits are ruled out, implying all traits are potential characteristics.
   - **Outcome: Non-Detectable Distortions**
     - Rule Out: *Spatial Overlapping*
     - Explanation: Lack of detectable distortions suggests the entity does not overlap multiple spatial dimensions.

4. **Interaction Experiments**
   - **Outcome: No Interaction**
     - No traits are ruled out, allowing for the consideration of all identified traits.
   - **Outcome: Minimal Interaction**
     - Rule Out: *Subspace Resonance*
     - Explanation: Minimal interaction implies a lack of subspace resonances that characterize the trait.
   - **Outcome: High Interaction**
     - No traits are ruled out, keeping the field open for potential trait identification.

5. **Dark Matter Flux Observation**
   - **Outcome: Flux Range (0 - 10)**
     - No traits are ruled out.
   - **Outcome: Flux Range (10 - 50)**
     - No traits are ruled out.
   - **Outcome: Flux Range (50 - 100)**
     - No traits are ruled out.
   - Explanation: All ranges maintain possibilities for all entity traits as no specific trait is eliminated by dark matter flux observations.

6. **Quantum Field Assessment**
   - **Outcome: Quantum Effects Range (0 - 50.0)**
     - No traits are ruled out.
   - **Outcome: Quantum Effects Range (50.0 - 100.0)**
     - No traits are ruled out.
   - **Outcome: Quantum Effects Range (100.0 - 150.0)**
     - No traits are ruled out.
   - Explanation: Quantum field assessments indicate potential trait presence without exclusion due to measured quantum effects.

### Conclusion

The specified experiments serve as a methodical approach to systematically rule out traits in the presence of transdimensional entities. Every observed outcome in our experimental framework aids investigators by providing clarity as to which traits are unlikely, narrowing the focus for subsequent investigations. By methodically ruling out possibilities, investigators can hone in on the true nature of these complex entities.
