# Music Genre Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook presents a framework for analyzing and understanding various music genres through a structured approach. By examining specific musical elements, we aim to differentiate between genres while excluding those that do not align with the observed characteristics. Our focus will be on four distinct music genres: Experimental, Hip Hop, Rock, and Psychedelic. We will utilize six types of analyses to draw conclusions about the presence or absence of these genres based on observed outcomes.

## Music Genres

### Experimental
Experimental music embraces innovative structures, sounds, and concepts. This genre often challenges traditional music norms and incorporates unconventional methods and themes, including the exploration of love and relationships.

### Hip Hop
Hip Hop is characterized by rhythmic vocal delivery, often referred to as rap, and is rooted in rhythmic and rhyming speech. It frequently employs through-composed structures and may feature harmonized background vocals. Instrumental tracks and slower tempos are common.

### Rock
Rock music typically features a strong backbeat and the use of electric guitars, bass guitar, and drums. Rock is known for its lack of improvisation and can often employ a through-composed song structure.

### Psychedelic
Psychedelic music is synonymous with altering perceptions, often using evocative lyrics that can explore themes of love and relationships. This genre often combines a wide variety of sounds and influences to create unique auditory experiences.
