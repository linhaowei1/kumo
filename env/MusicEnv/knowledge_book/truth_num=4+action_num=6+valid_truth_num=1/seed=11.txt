# Music Genre Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Music Genre Analysis Guidebook. This guide is designed to offer insights into identifying and analyzing specific characteristics of four distinct music genres: Ska, Metal, EDM (Electronic Dance Music), and Progressive Rock. Through six key analyses, we aim to clarify how these genres can be differentiated based on tempo, harmonic complexity, use of improvisation, synthesizers, live performance elements, and background vocals. This guide employs an exclusion-based approach, indicating which genres are eliminated based on observed analysis outcomes.

## Music Genres

### Ska
A genre known for its upbeat tempo and brass instrumentation, traditionally associated with lively performances and rhythmic complexity.

### Metal
Characterized by amplified distortion, loudness, and strong rhythms with less emphasis on improvisation or synthesizers.

### EDM (Electronic Dance Music)
Dominated by electronic sounds with a heavy use of minimal synthesizers, typically associated with club scenes and dynamic audience interaction.

### Progressive Rock
Noted for its innovative use of instrumental techniques and complex compositions, often incorporating elements of classical music or other genres.

## Analyses and Rule-Outs

### 1. Analyze Tempo
Assessing the speed at which a piece is played:
- **0 – 60 BPM**: If observed, rule out Metal, Ska, and EDM.
- **61 – 90 BPM**: If observed, rule out Ska and EDM.
- **91 – 120 BPM & 121 – 180 BPM & 181 – 300 BPM**: No genre is automatically ruled out, as no sets are given for these ranges.

### 2. Analyze Harmonic Complexity
Examine the richness and variety of chords used:
- **0 – 3**: Simple harmonic complexity; rule out Progressive Rock.
- **4 – 7 & 8 – 12**: No predefined genre exclusions.
- **13 – 24**: High harmonic complexity; rule out EDM.

### 3. Analyze Use of Improvisation
Evaluate the presence of spontaneous, on-the-spot musical invention:
- **High Improvisation**: If observed, rule out EDM.
- **Some Improvisation**: No specific exclusions provided.
- **No Improvisation**: If observed, rule out Metal.

### 4. Evaluate Use of Synthesizers
Consider the role of electronic keyboards and synthesizers:
- **Extensive Use**: No exclusions.
- **Minimal Use**: If observed, rule out EDM.
- **No Use**: If observed, rule out Metal.

### 5. Assess Live Performance Elements
Examine elements that contribute to a performance's dynamism:
- **High Energy**: No exclusions provided.
- **Low Energy**: If observed, rule out Metal.
- **Audience Interaction**: If significant, rule out EDM.

### 6. Examine Background Vocals
Observe the incorporation of secondary vocal elements:
- **Harmonized Background Vocals**: If present, rule out EDM.
- **Call and Response**: No rule out provided.
- **No Background Vocals**: If observed, rule out Metal.

## Conclusion

Each analysis provides a framework for ruling out music genres based on specific observations. By applying these criteria, you can differentiate between Ska, Metal, EDM, and Progressive Rock more effectively. This exclusion method ensures clarity in identifying unique genre characteristics and broadens understanding of the musical landscape.
