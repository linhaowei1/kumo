Opera is a rich, theatrical form of music known for its powerful vocal performances and orchestral accompaniment. It emphasizes dramatic storytelling, often in a classical language.

### 2. Classical
Classical music spans centuries of sophisticated musical composition, marked by its harmonic complexity and variety of structural forms. It is often instrumental and emphasizes intricate melodic and harmonic elements.

### 3. Grunge
Grunge is a subgenre that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, characterized by its raw and edgy sound tied to alternative rock. It often includes distorted guitars and themes of disillusionment.

## Analysis and Outcomes

### 1. Assess Use of Auto-Tune
- **Heavy Auto-Tune**: This characteristic rules out genres such as Classical and Opera, which are traditionally performed with natural vocals and do not rely on this technology. 
- **No Auto-Tune**: No explicit exclusions under this analysis, reinforcing the natural vocal traditions in these genres.

### 2. Examine Audience Participation Elements
- **Call and Response**: This outcome does not rule out any specific genres we are analyzing.
- **Sing-Alongs**: When observing sing-alongs, the genre of Grunge must be excluded, as it often encourages active audience vocal participation.
- **No Participation**: This strongly rules out Classical and Opera, where a more formal audience setting typically does not encourage direct audience involvement during performances.

### 3. Examine Rhythm Patterns
- **Syncopated**: Syncopation tends to rule out Classical and Opera, despite these genres having varied rhythmic structures.
- **Straight Beat**: No genres are excluded based on this straightforward rhythmic style.
- **Polyrhythms**: No exclusions are present through complex interlocking rhythmic patterns here.

### 4. Assess Use of Percussion
- **Heavy Percussion**: When heavy percussion is identified, Classical and Opera are ruled out because these genres favor a more balanced or moderate orchestration.
- **Light Percussion**: The presence of light percussion suggests excluding Grunge, which often features a more vigorous use of percussion.
- **Electronic Percussion**: No exclusions arise from the presence of electronic percussion effects.

### 5. Analyze Harmonic Complexity
- **Complexity Levels (0-24)**:
  - (0, 3): The lowest range of harmonic complexity results in Classical being ruled out, yet no other specific exclusions are defined for other complexity ranges.
  - Higher ranges do not specify exclusions among the considered genres.

### 6. Evaluate Genre Fusion Elements
- **Genre Fusion**: When fusion elements are observed, Classical and Opera are excluded due to their traditional, purist approach and adherence to established forms.
- **Pure Genre**: No specific exclusions arise when identifying the purity of a genre without fusion influences.
