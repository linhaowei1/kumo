# Music Genre Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to help you analyze various music genres using specific criteria to rule out possibilities based on distinct characteristics. By examining specific attributes of music, we can eliminate certain genres from consideration to narrow down what we might be listening to. This guide focuses on four music genres—Hip Hop, Medieval, World, and Waltz—and six different analyses to perform: examining instrumentation, determining time signature, examining language used, examining use of sampling, evaluating dynamics, and analyzing tempo.

## Music Genres Overview

### Hip Hop
Hip Hop is a genre characterized by rhythmic and rhyming speech known as rap. Though it often involves electronic instruments and sampling, it also can include acoustic instruments. Its dynamic range and tempo can vary, offering moderate changes in volume and a relatively slow beat.

### Medieval
This genre pertains to music from the Middle Ages, which generally features intricate melodies and harmonies. It often uses synthesizers in modern interpretations to replicate ancient instruments and can have a tempo ranging from moderate to fast.

### World
World music is a diverse genre incorporating various traditional and contemporary music styles from around the globe. As such, it can encompass many different languages and typically features a wide array of instruments.

### Waltz
Waltz is a smooth, flowing dance music style in triple time (3/4 time signature), characterized by its graceful tempo and rhythm that traditionally accompanies a ballroom dance of the same name.

### 3. Examine Language Used
Analyzing the use of language in a song's lyrics can be a telling factor in identifying or excluding certain genres.

### 4. Examine Use of Sampling
Sampling is the reuse of a portion of a sound recording in another recording.

- **Heavy Sampling**
  - No genres are ruled out based on heavy sampling.

- **No Sampling**
  - Ruled Out: *Hip Hop*

### 5. Evaluate Dynamics
Dynamics refers to the variation in loudness between notes or phrases.

- **Wide Dynamics**
  - No genres are ruled out based on wide dynamics.

- **Narrow Dynamics**
  - No genres are ruled out based on narrow dynamics.

- **Moderate Dynamics**
  - Ruled Out: *Hip Hop*

### 6. Analyze Tempo
The speed at which a piece of music is played, tempo is measured in beats per minute (BPM).

  - Ruled Out: *Medieval*

- **Tempo (181-300 BPM)**
