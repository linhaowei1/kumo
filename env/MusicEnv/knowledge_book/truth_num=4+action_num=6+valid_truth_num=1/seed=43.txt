# Music Genre Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to introduce you to the intricacies of analyzing various music genres through different musical dimensions. The genres we'll focus on are Grunge, Electronic, Folk, and Indie. For each genre, we will apply specific types of musical analyses to help identify distinct characteristics and differentiate between the styles.

### Analyzing Music Genres: Key Domains

1. **Analyze Tempo**: Tempo refers to the speed or pace of a piece of music and is measured in beats per minute (BPM). Understanding tempo helps us distinguish between genres based on typical speed ranges.

   - **(0 - 60 BPM)**: If a song falls within this tempo range, then it cannot be classified as Grunge or Electronic.
   - **(61 - 90 BPM)**: This tempo range rules out the possibility of the song being Grunge.
   - **(91 - 120 BPM)**: No genres are excluded in this range.
   - **(121 - 180 BPM)**: No genres are excluded in this range.
   - **(181 - 300 BPM)**: Songs in this tempo range cannot be considered Folk.

2. **Examine Audience Participation Elements**: This analysis looks at how a song encourages interaction from its audience, such as through call-and-response sections or sing-alongs.

   - **Call and Response**: No genres are ruled out under this element.
   - **Sing-Alongs**: If a song encourages sing-alongs, it cannot be classified as Grunge.
   - **No Participation**: Songs with no participation elements cannot be considered Folk.

3. **Examine Rhythm Patterns**: Rhythm refers to the timing of musical sounds or notes, and different rhythms can significantly influence a genre's style.

   - **Syncopated**: No genres are excluded with this rhythm pattern.
   - **Straight Beat**: No genres are excluded with this rhythm pattern.
   - **Polyrhythms**: Songs featuring polyrhythms cannot be classified as Folk.

4. **Examine Song Length**: The duration of a song can also help in identifying its genre, with some genres having typical song lengths.

   - **(0 - 2 minutes)**: No genres are ruled out for this song length.
   - **(2 - 4 minutes)**: If a song is between two and four minutes long, it cannot be Grunge.
   - **(4 - 10 minutes)**: No genres are ruled out for this song length.
   - **(10 - 60 minutes)**: No genres are ruled out for this song length.

5. **Evaluate Dynamics**: Dynamics in music refer to the volume of sound and the intensity and expressiveness within a song.

   - **Wide Dynamics**: No genres are excluded with wide dynamics.
   - **Narrow Dynamics**: Songs with narrow dynamics cannot be Folk.
   - **Moderate Dynamics**: No genres are excluded with moderate dynamics.

6. **Evaluate Use of Synthesizers**: The inclusion of synthesizers can be an important identifier for certain music genres, particularly those that rely heavily on electronic components.

   - **Extensive Use**: Songs featuring extensive use of synthesizers cannot be classified as Folk.
   - **Minimal Use**: No genres are ruled out with minimal use of synthesizers.
   - **No Use**: No genres are ruled out if synthesizers are completely unused.

### Conclusion

By systematically analyzing each song based on tempo, audience participation, rhythm, song length, dynamics, and the use of synthesizers, one can effectively rule out certain genres to better understand the music in question. This guide serves to demystify the analysis process and provide clarity on identifying and classifying music genres with accuracy.
