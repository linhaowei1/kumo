# Music Genre Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of analyzing four distinct music genres: Metal, Latin, Hip Hop, and Indie. It focuses on six key areas of analysis: Production Techniques, Language Used, Vocal Harmonies, Danceability, Thematic Consistency, and Instrument Solos. Our guide will help you understand the relationships between these analyses and the specific music genres, highlighting which genres may be excluded based on particular outcomes in each analysis.

## Music Genres Overview

### Metal
Metal is characterized by its powerful sound, often featuring electric guitars and dynamic rhythms. Though it can possess simple vocal harmonies, metal is known for its intensity and depth.

### Latin
Latin music covers a wide range of rhythms and instruments, characterized by its origins in South and Central America. This genre often includes vibrant tempos and is typically composed with lyrical content in Spanish or Portuguese.

### Hip Hop
Hip Hop is a diverse genre with strong rhythmic beats and lyrical storytelling. Its complex vocal harmonies and high thematic consistency make it distinct. It often features instrumental loops and samples over traditional solos.

### Indie
Indie music is known for its diverse production styles and expressive soundscapes. It typically possesses high production value, venturing into experimental arrangements that separate it from mainstream offerings.

## Analyses

### 1. Evaluate Production Techniques
This analysis examines the quality and method of recording in music production.

- **Lo-Fi**: No genres are excluded when a Lo-Fi production technique is observed.
- **High Production Value**: Indie is ruled out when high production value is observed, as the TA_mapping specifies that Indie should be excluded in this scenario.
- **Live Recording**: No genres are excluded when live recording is observed.

### 2. Examine Language Used
This analysis looks at the choice of language or lack thereof in a musical piece.

- **English**: Latin is ruled out if English is predominantly used, as Latin typically uses non-English languages.
- **Non-English**: No genres are excluded based on the use of non-English language specifically.
- **Instrumental**: Hip Hop is ruled out if the piece is instrumental due to its strong emphasis on lyrical content.

### 3. Evaluate Vocal Harmonies
This analysis assesses the complexity and presence of vocal harmonies within the music.

- **Complex Harmonies**: Hip Hop is ruled out when complex harmonies are present, as it usually involves intricate layering rather than harmonic singing.
- **Simple Harmonies**: Metal is ruled out when simple harmonies are present, which contradicts Metal’s typical use of robust vocal styles.
- **No Harmonies**: No genres are excluded when there are no harmonies.

### 4. Assess Danceability
This analysis evaluates the music’s propensity to inspire dancing.

- **Danceability (0-3)**: No genres are excluded when danceability is low.
- **Danceability (4-6)**: Metal is ruled out when danceability is in the moderate range (4-6), as Metal typically has lower danceability compared to other genres.
- **Danceability (7-10)**: Hip Hop is ruled out when danceability is high (7-10), as it typically boasts higher danceability.

### 5. Analyze Thematic Consistency
This analysis examines the uniformity and clarity of themes presented in the music.

- **High Consistency**: Hip Hop and Metal are ruled out when high thematic consistency is observed, as the TA_mapping specifies these genres should be excluded under this condition.
- **Low Consistency**: No genres are excluded based on low thematic consistency.

### 6. Analyze Instrument Solos
This analysis investigates the presence and type of instrumental solos within the music.

- **Guitar Solo**: Hip Hop is ruled out when guitar solos are emphasized, as it commonly features beats and samples over instrumental solos.
- **Saxophone Solo**: Metal is ruled out when saxophone solos are present, as they are unconventional in this genre.
- **No Solos**: No genres are excluded when solos are absent, allowing for a wider consideration.

### Conclusion
By understanding and applying these analyses and outcomes, one can better distinguish between Metal, Latin, Hip Hop, and Indie music genres. Each analysis provides valuable insights into what makes each genre unique while also highlighting which genres do not fit specific outcomes. Utilizing these guidelines ensures a comprehensive approach to music genre analysis.
