To effectively analyze and identify the leadership styles of managers, it's important to observe their behaviors and decisions. This guide will help you understand how to exclude certain leadership styles based on specific observed outcomes. We will examine the styles of leadership first, followed by the methods used to assess them, and finally, the observed outcomes that help rule out leadership styles.

### Leadership Styles

1. **Creative**: Leaders who think outside the box and encourage innovation. They might be seen as visionaries who push the boundaries within their organizations.

2. **Collaborative**: Leaders who emphasize teamwork and the power of collective input. They foster environments where everyone’s voice is heard.

3. **Flexible**: Leaders who can quickly adapt to changing circumstances and are comfortable making adjustments as necessary.

4. **Transactional**: Leaders who focus on structured policy and clear objectives. They value efficiency and clear rewards for performance.

### Methods for Analysis

To effectively determine a manager's leadership style, you should consider the following methods:

1. **Adaptability to Change**: Evaluating how a leader responds to new situations or modifies strategies in the face of new developments.
   
2. **Level of Formality**: Observing the degree of formality a manager maintains in communication and operations.

3. **Ethical Considerations**: Understanding how much importance a leader places on ethical behavior in decision-making processes.

4. **Alignment with Organizational Goals**: Seeing how well a leader’s actions support and drive the organization’s objectives.

5. **Openness to Feedback**: Gauging how willing a manager is to receive and act on feedback from team members.

6. **Focus on Long-term Planning**: Assessing how much emphasis a leader places on future goals versus immediate tasks.

### Observed Outcomes and Excluded Leadership Styles

Based on the observed outcomes from the analysis methods, you can rule out certain leadership styles as possibilities:

1. **Adaptability to Change**:
   - When a manager is **resistant to change**, exclude the **Flexible** style.
   - No exclusions when change is embraced enthusiastically or when adapting to change is seen as necessary.

2. **Level of Formality**:
   - When a manager is **highly formal**, exclude the **Creative** style.
   - No specific exclusions for balanced or highly informal levels.

3. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - When a manager **prioritizes ethics** highly, exclude the **Transactional** style.
   - No specific exclusions for considering ethics important or disregarding ethics.

4. **Alignment with Organizational Goals**:
   - When alignment is scored between **0 to 1**, exclude the **Collaborative** style.
   - When alignment is high (between 4 to 10), exclude the **Transactional** style.

5. **Openness to Feedback**:
   - When a manager is **open to feedback from the team**, exclude the **Transactional** style.
   - No exclusions if feedback is ignored or discouraged.

6. **Focus on Long-term Planning**:
   - When there is a **strong emphasis on long-term goals**, exclude the **Transactional** style.
   - No exclusions for those balancing short- and long-term goals or focusing on immediate tasks.

By following this guide and observing managerial behaviors through the lens of these analytical methods, you can make informed estimates about which leadership styles are less likely based on what you observe. This exclusion process aids in narrowing down the leadership style to the most probable options.
