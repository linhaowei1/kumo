# Fermentation Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of various fermentation processes and outlines a set of tests that can be used to eliminate certain fermentation processes based on specific outcomes. By understanding these fermentation processes and associated tests, analysts can efficiently deduce which processes are not applicable under given conditions. This guidebook covers four key fermentation processes and six diagnostic tests.

## Fermentation Processes

1. **Malolactic Fermentation**
   - A secondary fermentation process commonly used in winemaking to convert malic acid into lactic acid, softening the taste and adding complexity to the wine.

2. **Citric Acid Fermentation**
   - A process primarily involving the production of citric acid by microorganisms such as Aspergillus niger. It's widely used in the food and beverage industry for flavoring and preservation.

3. **Mannitol Fermentation**
   - A fermentation process utilized mostly in the pharmaceutical and food industries to produce mannitol, a type of sugar alcohol, through the microbial conversion of sugars.

4. **Vinegar Fermentation**
   - A process that converts ethanol (alcohol) into acetic acid via bacteria. This process is fundamental in producing vinegar for culinary uses.

## Byproduct/Microbial Strain Tests

### 1. Sugar Content Measurement (Brix)
- Measures the sugar level in a solution. The outcomes of this test can help eliminate certain fermentation processes:
  - **0-5 Brix:** All fermentation processes remain possible.
  - **5-15 Brix:** No rule-out for any processes.
  - **15-35 Brix:** Vinegar fermentation is ruled out as a fermentation option.

### 2. Organic Acid Profiling
- Identifies the concentration and types of organic acids present, which can exclude certain fermentations:
  - **High lactic acid:** No processes are excluded.
  - **High acetic acid:** All processes remain potentially valid.
  - **Low organic acids:** Citric acid fermentation is ruled out.

### 3. Viscosity Measurement
- Assesses the thickness or thinness of the fermentation medium:
  - **0.0-1.0 cP:** No exclusions occur.
  - **1.0-5.0 cP:** All processes remain possible.
  - **5.0-10.0 cP:** Mannitol fermentation is ruled out.

### 4. pH Measurement
- Determines the acidity or alkalinity of the solution, impacting possible fermentation processes:
  - **0.0-3.5 pH:** All processes are still viable options.
  - **3.5-4.5 pH:** No processes are ruled out.
  - **4.5-7.0 pH:** Citric acid, Malolactic, and Vinegar fermentations are excluded.

### 5. Viability Staining
- A test to assess microbial viability, pointing to active fermentation:
  - **High viability:** Malolactic fermentation is ruled out.
  - **Low viability:** No processes are excluded.

### 6. Alcohol Content Measurement
- Measures ethanol levels, providing insights on feasible fermentations:
  - **0.0-0.5%:** No fermentation processes are ruled out.
  - **0.5-5.0%:** All processes remain under consideration.
  - **5.0-20.0%:** Vinegar fermentation is ruled out.

This guide is structured to help users systematically eliminate certain processes based on the outcomes of these tests, thereby narrowing down the potential fermentation processes at play. By following the exclusion rules specified above, analysts can effectively navigate through the fermentation scenarios with confidence and precision.
