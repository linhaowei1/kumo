# Fermentation Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Fermentation Analysis Guidebook. This guide is designed to help you navigate and understand various fermentation processes and the corresponding tests to rule out certain processes based on observed outcomes. This approach empowers you to narrow down the possibilities and gain a clearer understanding of the fermentation involved. Let's delve into the details.

## Fermentation Processes

This guide addresses the following key fermentation processes:

1. **High-Sugar Fermentations**: These involve the conversion of high sugar concentrations to alcohol and other byproducts. Common in producing alcoholic beverages with higher sugar content.

2. **Mannitol Fermentation**: Specifically involves the conversion of sugars to mannitol, commonly used in the food industry due to its sugary flavor and health benefits.

3. **Homofermentative Lactic Acid Fermentation**: This process primarily produces lactic acid from sugar, seen in yogurt and certain types of cheese production.

4. **Sake Fermentation**: Traditional Japanese fermentation involving rice, producing sake. Unique for its multiple parallel fermentations, converting starch to sugar and sugar to alcohol simultaneously.

## Byproduct/Microbial Strain Tests

To analyze and rule out possible fermentation processes, we utilize the following tests:

### 1. pH Measurement
This test assesses the acidity or alkalinity of the fermentation, crucial in determining which process can be excluded:
- **pH 0.0 to 3.5**: No processes ruled out.
- **pH 3.5 to 4.5**: No processes ruled out.
- **pH 4.5 to 7.0**: Homofermentative lactic acid fermentation is ruled out.

### 2. Sugar Content Measurement (Brix)
Measures the remaining sugar content, helping identify processes incompatible with the sugar level:
- **Brix 0 to 5**: Excludes High-Sugar Fermentations and Sake Fermentation.
- **Brix 5 to 15**: No processes ruled out.
- **Brix 15 to 35**: No processes ruled out.

### 3. Turbidity Measurement
Evaluates the clarity of the fermentation, providing insight into excluded processes:
- **Turbidity 0.0 to 50.0**: Sake fermentation is ruled out.
- **Turbidity 50.0 to 200.0**: No processes ruled out.

### 4. Color Measurement
Assesses the color of the fermentation, ruling out incompatible processes:
- **Colorless**: No processes ruled out.
- **Amber**: Sake fermentation is ruled out.
- **Dark**: No processes ruled out.

### 5. Viscosity Measurement
Determines the thickness or flow resistance of the liquid, informing potential exclusions:
- **Viscosity 0.0 to 1.0**: No processes ruled out.
- **Viscosity 1.0 to 5.0**: No processes ruled out.
- **Viscosity 5.0 to 10.0**: Mannitol fermentation is ruled out.

### 6. Alcohol Content Measurement
Quantifies the level of ethanol, excluding certain fermentations based on alcohol content:
- **Alcohol 0.0 to 0.5**: Sake fermentation is ruled out.
- **Alcohol 0.5 to 5.0**: No processes ruled out.
- **Alcohol 5.0 to 20.0**: No processes ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guide emphasizes a strategic approach to exclude particular fermentation processes based on test outcomes. By applying these tests, you're equipped to methodically narrow down possibilities and accurately assess the fermentative nature of the sample. Understanding these exclusions empowers you to make informed decisions and interpretations in your fermentation analyses.
