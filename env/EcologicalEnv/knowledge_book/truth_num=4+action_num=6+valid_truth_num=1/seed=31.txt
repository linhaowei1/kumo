# Ecological Analysis Guide

This guide introduces the concept of ecological niches and outlines various investigations used to understand them. Each investigation provides insights by excluding certain niches based on observed outcomes. This approach helps ecologists narrow down the specific niche characteristics of species within a given ecosystem.

## Ecological Niches

1. **Urban Pest**: Species thriving in urban environments, often considered nuisances due to their ability to infest or cause damage within human settings.

2. **Temperate Grassland Burrower**: Animals that live predominantly in the burrows of temperate grasslands, often contributing to soil turnover and ecosystem aeration.

3. **Tropical Rainforest Frugivore**: These species primarily consume fruits and play crucial roles in seed dispersal and forest regeneration in tropical rainforests.

4. **Montane Carnivore**: Predators that inhabit mountainous regions, often adapted to cold climates and varied terrains.

## Investigations and Outcomes

### 1. Altitude Range Test
This investigation assesses the altitude at which different species are commonly found, helping to exclude non-matching niches.

- **Outcome: (0, 1000)** - Excludes Montane Carnivores from consideration, as they are not found at this altitude range.
- **Outcome: (1000, 3000)** - Excludes Urban Pests, which are normally not found at these elevations.
- **Outcome: (3000, 6000)** - No niches are excluded in this altitude range, indicating that all listed niches are possible under these conditions.

### 2. Nocturnal Activity Monitoring
This test determines whether species are active at night (nocturnal) or during the day (diurnal).

- **Outcome: Nocturnal** - Rules out Tropical Rainforest Frugivores, as they are not typically nocturnal.
- **Outcome: Diurnal** - This outcome indicates that the species' activity pattern does not match with Urban Pests, which are not typically diurnal.

### 3. Feeding Rate Measurement
This study looks at how much a species consumes within a given timeframe.

- **Outcome: (0, 10)** - Montane Carnivores are excluded at these low feeding rates, as their dietary needs require higher consumption.
- **Outcome: (10, 100)** - No niches are excluded at this feeding rate range.
- **Outcome: (100, 1000)** - Temperate Grassland Burrowers are excluded, indicating their feeding is not at this range.

### 4. Dietary Analysis
The dietary analysis investigates the type of food predominant in a species' diet.

- **Outcome: Herbivorous Diet** - Excludes Montane Carnivores, as their diet does not align with herbivory.
- **Outcome: Carnivorous Diet** - Rules out Temperate Grassland Burrowers from consideration, as their diet typically includes plant material.
- **Outcome: Omnivorous Diet** - No exclusions are made, suggesting compatibility with multiple niches.
- **Outcome: Filter Feeder Diet** - Both Temperate Grassland Burrowers and Montane Carnivores are not consistent with this dietary outcome.

### 5. Behavioral Study
This study observes species behaviors to deduce social structures or solitary tendencies.

- **Outcome: Solitary Behavior** - Urban Pests are typically social by nature; thus, they are ruled out if solitary behavior is observed.
- **Outcome: Social Behavior** - No niches are excluded, hinting at potential compatibility with all.

### 6. Temperature Tolerance Test
This test determines the temperature range species can tolerate, attributing to ecological adaptation.

- **Outcome: (0, 10)** - When temperatures fall within this range, both Urban Pests and Tropical Rainforest Frugivores are excluded, as these conditions are too extreme.
- **Outcome: (10, 20)** - Excludes Tropical Rainforest Frugivores, suggesting conditions above their temperature tolerance.
- **Outcome: (20, 30)** - No niches are excluded, indicating this is an adaptable range for all listed niches.

By following the outlined investigations and their corresponding outcomes, ecologists can systematically exclude certain ecological niches and gain deeper insight into the potential habitat matches for specific species. This approach helps streamline ecological research by directing attention towards the most fitting niches for future conservation and study efforts.
