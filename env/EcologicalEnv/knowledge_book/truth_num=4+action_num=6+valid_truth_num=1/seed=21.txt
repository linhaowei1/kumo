### Ecological Analysis Guide

This guide provides an understanding of specific ecological niches and the investigative tests used to explore them. By examining the following niches and performing certain investigations, researchers can outline which ecological niches are not suitable based on observed outcomes.

#### Ecological Niches Overview

1. **Arctic Sea Ice Carnivore**: This niche includes carnivorous animals that thrive in the icy conditions of Arctic sea environments.

2. **Deep Sea Predator**: Predators in this niche are adapted to living at great oceanic depths, often characterized by high pressures and limited light.

3. **Savanna Apex Predator**: These are top predators residing in the savanna, a biome known for its grassy plains and intermittent trees.

4. **Forest Understory Carnivore**: Carnivorous species that inhabit the dense and darker underlayer of forest ecosystems fall under this niche.

#### Investigative Tests and Rule-Out Outcomes

The following investigations enable researchers to exclude specific niches when certain conditions or observations are made:

1. **Salinity Tolerance Test**
   - Aims to determine the ability of organisms to withstand different salinity levels.
   - Outcomes:
     - **Salinity Range 0-5**: Excludes Arctic Sea Ice Carnivore and Deep Sea Predator.
     - **Salinity Range 5-15**: Excludes Arctic Sea Ice Carnivore and Deep Sea Predator.
     - **Salinity Range 15-35**: No exclusions.

2. **Altitude Range Test**
   - Assesses the range of altitudes an organism can inhabit.
   - Outcomes:
     - **Altitude 0-1000**: No exclusions.
     - **Altitude 1000-3000**: No exclusions.
     - **Altitude 3000-6000**: Excludes Deep Sea Predator and Forest Understory Carnivore.

3. **Feeding Rate Measurement**
   - Measures the rate at which organisms consume food.
   - Outcomes:
     - **Feeding Rate 0-10**: Excludes Savanna Apex Predator.
     - **Feeding Rate 10-100**: No exclusions.
     - **Feeding Rate 100-1000**: Excludes Forest Understory Carnivore.

4. **Light Preference Test**
   - Determines whether organisms prefer light or dark environments.
   - Outcomes:
     - **Photophilic (light-loving)**: Excludes Arctic Sea Ice Carnivore and Deep Sea Predator.
     - **Photophobic (light-avoiding)**: No exclusions.

5. **Behavioral Study**
   - Observes social behavior patterns.
   - Outcomes:
     - **Solitary Behavior**: No exclusions.
     - **Social Behavior**: Excludes Forest Understory Carnivore.

6. **Habitat Observation**
   - Involves observing the natural habitat preferences.
   - Outcomes:
     - **High Altitude Habitat**: Excludes Deep Sea Predator.
     - **Aquatic Habitat**: Excludes Forest Understory Carnivore and Savanna Apex Predator.
     - **Desert Habitat**: Excludes Deep Sea Predator.
     - **Forest Habitat**: Excludes Arctic Sea Ice Carnivore and Deep Sea Predator.
     - **Urban Habitat**: Excludes Deep Sea Predator.

### Conclusion

This guide provides a straightforward framework for assessing ecological niches through various investigations, focusing on ruling out unsuitable niches based on environmental and behavioral outcomes. By conducting these tests, researchers can effectively narrow down the ecological roles of species within these environments.
