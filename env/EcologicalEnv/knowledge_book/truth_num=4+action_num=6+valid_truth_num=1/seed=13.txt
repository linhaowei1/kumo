### Ecological Analysis Guide: An Introduction to Niches and Investigations

Understanding ecological niches helps us comprehend how different species interact with their environment and fulfill specific roles within ecosystems. This guide introduces four ecological niches and outlines several ecological investigations used to understand and differentiate them based on specific environmental responses. Each investigation reveals conditions under which certain niches can be ruled out, helping focus ecological research and conservation efforts.

#### Ecological Niches:

1. **Mangrove Tree Climber**: This niche pertains to organisms adept at navigating the complex root and branch systems of mangrove trees. They engage in activities such as foraging or escaping predators among these structures.

2. **Rainforest Nectar Feeder**: Species in this niche are primarily adapted to consuming nectar from a variety of flowering plants in rainforest habitats.

3. **Mangrove Insectivore**: These creatures are specialized in feeding on insects within mangrove ecosystems, often utilizing the unique habitat to hunt or hide.

4. **Open Ocean Plankton Feeder**: These are species adapted to oceanic environments, consuming plankton as their primary food source, utilizing vast waters and currents to find sustenance.

#### Ecological Investigations and Rule-Out Conditions:

1. **Habitat Observation**: This involves observing where species are likely or unlikely to thrive.
   - **High Altitude Habitat**: Rules out *Mangrove Insectivore* and *Mangrove Tree Climber*.
   - **Aquatic Habitat**: No niches are ruled out here, indicating adaptability to water environments.
   - **Desert Habitat**: Rules out *Rainforest Nectar Feeder* and *Mangrove Insectivore*.
   - **Forest Habitat**: Rules out *Open Ocean Plankton Feeder*, *Mangrove Insectivore*, and *Mangrove Tree Climber*.
   - **Urban Habitat**: Rules out *Rainforest Nectar Feeder* and *Mangrove Insectivore*.

2. **Altitude Range Test**: Measures the elevation at which species can survive.
   - **0 to 1000 meters**: No niches are excluded.
   - **1000 to 3000 meters**: Rules out *Mangrove Insectivore* and *Mangrove Tree Climber*.
   - **3000 to 6000 meters**: No niches are excluded.

3. **Light Preference Test**: Assesses the light conditions preferred by the species.
   - **Photophilic (light-loving)**: Rules out *Mangrove Insectivore*.
   - **Photophobic (light-avoiding)**: Rules out *Rainforest Nectar Feeder*.

4. **Temperature Tolerance Test**: Examines the temperature range species can endure.
   - **0 to 10 degrees Celsius**: Rules out *Rainforest Nectar Feeder*, *Mangrove Insectivore*, and *Mangrove Tree Climber*.
   - **10 to 20 degrees Celsius**: Rules out the same as above.
   - **20 to 30 degrees Celsius**: No niches are excluded.

5. **Feeding Rate Measurement**: Looks at how much these species consume within given periods.
   - **0 to 10 units**: No niches are excluded.
   - **10 to 100 units**: Rules out *Rainforest Nectar Feeder* and *Mangrove Insectivore*.
   - **100 to 1000 units**: No niches are excluded.

6. **Dietary Analysis**: Focuses on the dietary habits and requirements of the niches.
   - **Herbivorous Diet**: No niches are excluded.
   - **Carnivorous Diet**: Rules out *Rainforest Nectar Feeder*, *Mangrove Insectivore*, and *Mangrove Tree Climber*.
   - **Omnivorous Diet**: Rules out *Open Ocean Plankton Feeder*, *Rainforest Nectar Feeder*, and *Mangrove Insectivore*.
   - **Filter Feeder Diet**: No niches are excluded.

By applying these investigations and understanding the rule-out conditions, researchers can more effectively identify the likely niches species occupy and the specific ecological roles they play, enhancing biodiversity mapping and conservation strategies.
