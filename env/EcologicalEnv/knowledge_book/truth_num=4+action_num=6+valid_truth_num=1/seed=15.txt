# Ecological Analysis Guide

This guide provides an overview of specific ecological niches and corresponding investigations to enhance understanding and analysis. The ecological niches discussed are 'Estuary Filter Feeder,' 'Urban Pest,' 'Grassland Seed Disperser,' and 'Kelp Forest Herbivore.' Complementing these niches are a set of investigations designed to observe and rule out these niches based on specific environmental conditions and preferences.

## Ecological Niches Overview

1. **Estuary Filter Feeder**: Organisms in this niche are typically found in estuarine environments where they filter out particles from the water for nutrition.

2. **Urban Pest**: These are species adapted to urban living conditions, often thriving in environments that other species may find challenging.

3. **Grassland Seed Disperser**: This niche involves species that contribute to the ecosystem by dispersing seeds, promoting plant diversity and growth in grassland areas.

4. **Kelp Forest Herbivore**: These species inhabit kelp forests and primarily feed on the kelp itself or associated flora.

## Investigations and Outcome Interpretations

Each investigation aims to determine the presence or exclusion of specific ecological niches based on observed outcomes. Below are the investigations and the niches that can be ruled out based on their results:

1. **Salinity Tolerance Test**:
   - Outcomes:
     - (0, 5) ppt: Rule out 'Estuary Filter Feeder,' 'Kelp Forest Herbivore'
     - (5, 15) ppt: Rule out 'Kelp Forest Herbivore'
     - (15, 35) ppt: Rule out 'Estuary Filter Feeder'
   - This test assesses an organism's ability to survive in varying salinity levels, critical for distinguishing between organisms in freshwater and marine environments.

2. **Altitude Range Test**:
   - Outcomes:
     - (0, 1000) meters: Rule out no niches
     - (1000, 3000) meters: Rule out 'Estuary Filter Feeder,' 'Urban Pest'
     - (3000, 6000) meters: Rule out 'Kelp Forest Herbivore'
   - The test determines species' altitude preferences, distinguishing between lowland and high altitude-adapted organisms.

3. **Feeding Rate Measurement**:
   - Outcomes:
     - (0, 10) units: Rule out no niches
     - (10, 100) units: Rule out no niches
     - (100, 1000) units: Rule out 'Grassland Seed Disperser'
   - Evaluates how much food an organism consumes, helping to identify feeding efficiency or specialization, particularly in resource-scarce environments.

4. **Light Preference Test**:
   - Outcomes:
     - Photophilic: Rule out no niches
     - Photophobic: Rule out 'Kelp Forest Herbivore'
   - The test captures an organism's preference or aversion to light, essential for understanding habitats an organism can thrive in.

5. **Dietary Analysis**:
   - Outcomes:
     - Herbivorous Diet: Rule out no niches
     - Carnivorous Diet: Rule out 'Grassland Seed Disperser,' 'Kelp Forest Herbivore'
     - Omnivorous Diet: Rule out 'Estuary Filter Feeder'
     - Filter Feeder Diet: Rule out no niches
   - This analysis helps distinguish the type of diet and, therefore, the possible ecological roles an organism may fulfill.

6. **Temperature Tolerance Test**:
   - Outcomes:
     - (0, 10) °C: Rule out 'Urban Pest'
     - (10, 20) °C: Rule out 'Estuary Filter Feeder'
     - (20, 30) °C: Rule out no niches
   - Evaluates an organism's ability to withstand various temperature ranges, indicating potential habitats an organism can successfully occupy.

By applying these investigations and observing the outcomes, researchers and ecologists can effectively rule out specific ecological niches, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the environmental adaptability and preference of species within given ecosystems.
