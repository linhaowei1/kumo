### Ecological Analysis Guide: Investigating Ecological Niches

Understanding ecological niches is crucial for comprehensively analyzing ecosystems and the interactions between organisms and their environments. This guide introduces specific ecological niches and how particular investigations can help in ruling out certain niches based on observed outcomes.

#### Ecological Niches

1. **Polar Sea Mammal**
   - These are mammals adapted to cold oceanic environments, typically found in polar regions.

2. **Mangrove Insectivore**
   - Organisms that primarily feed on insects within mangrove ecosystems, known for dense tree coverage and brackish water.

3. **High Mountain Pollinator**
   - Pollinators found at high altitudes, such as bees and butterflies, often crucial for plant reproduction in mountainous regions.

4. **Mangrove Tree Climber**
   - Species adapted to climbing trees in mangrove habitats, possibly for feeding or nesting purposes.

#### Investigations and Outcome-based Rule Outs

The following investigations test specific environmental or behavioral variables and allow for the ruling out of certain ecological niches based on observed outcomes:

1. **Altitude Range Test**
   - **Outcome Rule-Out:**
     - If the altitude is between 0 and 1000 meters, rule out "High Mountain Pollinator."
     - If the altitude is between 1000 and 3000 meters, rule out "Mangrove Insectivore" and "Mangrove Tree Climber."
     - At altitudes of 3000 to 6000 meters, there are no specific niches to rule out.

2. **Light Preference Test**
   - **Outcome Rule-Out:**
     - For photophilic environments (light-loving), rule out "Mangrove Insectivore."
     - In photophobic environments (light-averse), rule out "High Mountain Pollinator."

3. **Habitat Observation**
   - **Outcome Rule-Out:**
     - In high altitude habitats, rule out "Polar Sea Mammal," "Mangrove Insectivore," and "Mangrove Tree Climber."
     - In aquatic habitats, rule out "High Mountain Pollinator."
     - In desert habitats, rule out "Polar Sea Mammal" and "Mangrove Insectivore."
     - In forest habitats, rule out "Polar Sea Mammal," "Mangrove Insectivore," and "Mangrove Tree Climber."
     - In urban habitats, rule out "Mangrove Insectivore."

4. **Feeding Rate Measurement**
   - **Outcome Rule-Out:**
     - With a feeding rate between 0 and 10, rule out "Polar Sea Mammal."
     - With a feeding rate between 10 and 100, rule out "Mangrove Insectivore."
     - Feeding rates from 100 to 1000 do not rule out any specific niches.

5. **Salinity Tolerance Test**
   - **Outcome Rule-Out:**
     - At salinity levels of 0 to 5, rule out "Polar Sea Mammal," "Mangrove Insectivore," and "Mangrove Tree Climber."
     - At 5 to 15, rule out "Polar Sea Mammal."
     - At salinity levels of 15 to 35, rule out "Mangrove Insectivore" and "Mangrove Tree Climber."

6. **Dietary Analysis**
   - **Outcome Rule-Out:**
     - For a herbivorous diet, no ecological niches are ruled out.
     - With a carnivorous diet, rule out "Mangrove Insectivore" and "Mangrove Tree Climber."
     - With an omnivorous diet, rule out "Mangrove Insectivore."
     - For a filter feeder diet, no niches are directly ruled out.

This guide ensures a comprehensive analysis by explaining how specific outcomes from investigations lead to ruling out unsuitable ecological niches, thereby narrowing down which niches are most likely applicable to the conditions observed in a study area.
