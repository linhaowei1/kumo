### Ecological Analysis Guide

This guide provides an overview of specific ecological niches and outlines how various investigations can be used to rule out certain niches based on observed outcomes. By excluding ecological niches from consideration, researchers can narrow down the possible niches that an organism might occupy, making it easier to identify its actual niche.

#### Ecological Niches

1. **Desert Carnivore**
   - Refers to carnivorous animals adapted to living in desert environments, often characterized by scarcity of water and extreme temperature variations.

2. **Oceanic Pelagic Predator**
   - These are predators that inhabit the open ocean, away from the coast and sea floor. They are adapted to living in vast, open water areas.

3. **Deep Sea Predator**
   - Predatory species that reside in the deep ocean environments where sunlight does not penetrate. These organisms are adapted to high pressure and cold temperatures.

4. **Tropical Rainforest Frugivore**
   - Animals that consume mainly fruit and live in the lush, biodiverse ecosystems of tropical rainforests.

#### Investigations and Their Outcomes

The following investigations can be used to study ecological niches, with specific outcomes providing insights into which niches are not applicable under certain conditions.

1. **Temperature Tolerance Test**
   - **Outcome Ranges**:
     - (0, 10) degrees Celsius: Desert Carnivores and Tropical Rainforest Frugivores are ruled out.
     - (10, 20) degrees Celsius: Desert Carnivores and Tropical Rainforest Frugivores are ruled out.
     - (20, 30) degrees Celsius: No niches are excluded.

2. **Feeding Rate Measurement**
   - **Outcome Ranges**:
     - (0, 10): Oceanic Pelagic Predators are ruled out.
     - (10, 100): No niches are excluded.
     - (100, 1000): No niches are excluded.

3. **Behavioral Study**
   - **Exclusion Outcomes**:
     - Solitary Behavior: No niches are ruled out.
     - Social Behavior: Desert Carnivores are ruled out.

4. **Nocturnal Activity Monitoring**
   - **Activity Patterns**:
     - Nocturnal: Tropical Rainforest Frugivores are ruled out.
     - Diurnal: No niches are excluded.

5. **Altitude Range Test**
   - **Altitude Outcomes**:
     - (0, 1000) meters: No niches are excluded.
     - (1000, 3000) meters: No niches are excluded.
     - (3000, 6000) meters: Desert Carnivores and Deep Sea Predators are ruled out.

6. **Dietary Analysis**
   - **Diet Patterns**:
     - Herbivorous Diet: Desert Carnivores, Deep Sea Predators, and Oceanic Pelagic Predators are ruled out.
     - Carnivorous Diet: No niches are excluded.
     - Omnivorous Diet: No niches are excluded.
     - Filter Feeder Diet: Desert Carnivores are ruled out.

### Conclusion

By performing these investigations and applying the corresponding exclusion rules, researchers can systematically eliminate certain ecological niches based on observed conditions. The exclusion method helps focus research efforts on identifying the correct ecological niche that an organism occupies, enhancing our understanding of its ecological role.
