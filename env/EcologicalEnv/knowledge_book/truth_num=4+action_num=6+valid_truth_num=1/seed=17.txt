### Ecological Analysis Guide

This guide aims to provide an understanding of different ecological niches and how specific investigations help in identifying or ruling out these niches based on various environmental and biological factors.

#### Ecological Niches Overview

1. **Grassland Seed Disperser**: An organism that primarily lives in grassland areas, contributing to the ecosystem by dispersing seeds across its habitat. 
    
2. **Deep Sea Predator**: A species that thrives in the deep sea, known for its predatory behavior in environments with extreme pressure and limited light. 
    
3. **Coral Reef Predatory Fish**: This niche includes fish species that reside in coral reef ecosystems, where they play a crucial role as predators.
    
4. **Deep Sea Vent Chemosynthesizer**: Organisms that exist around deep-sea hydrothermal vents, utilizing chemosynthesis to convert inorganic compounds into energy.

#### Investigative Methods

Several key investigations can help identify these niches by ruling out certain ecological characteristics:

1. **Dietary Analysis**: This investigation focuses on identifying the dietary preferences of an organism.
    
    - **Herbivorous Diet**: Rules out **Deep Sea Predator** and **Coral Reef Predatory Fish**.
    - **Carnivorous Diet**: Excludes **Grassland Seed Disperser**.
    - **Omnivorous Diet**: Rules out the **Deep Sea Vent Chemosynthesizer**.
    - **Filter Feeder Diet**: Does not exclude any specific niches based on this outcome alone.
       
2. **Light Preference Test**: Investigates the preference of organisms for light exposure.
    
    - **Photophilic (Light-Loving)**: Excludes **Deep Sea Vent Chemosynthesizer** and **Deep Sea Predator**.
    - **Photophobic (Light-Avoiding)**: By default, all niches are allowed as no specific preference excludes them.
    
3. **Habitat Observation**: Observes the living environment preferences of the species.
    
    - **High Altitude Habitat**: Rules out **Deep Sea Vent Chemosynthesizer** and **Deep Sea Predator**.
    - **Aquatic Habitat**: Excludes **Grassland Seed Disperser**.
    - **Desert Habitat**: Excludes **Deep Sea Predator**.
    - **Forest Habitat**: Rules out **Deep Sea Predator** and **Coral Reef Predatory Fish**.
    - **Urban Habitat**: Excludes **Deep Sea Predator** and **Coral Reef Predatory Fish**.
    
4. **Feeding Rate Measurement**: Assesses how quickly and in what quantity an organism consumes food.
    
    - **(0, 10)**: Does not rule out any niche specifically.
    - **(10, 100)**: Also does not exclude any niches directly.
    - **(100, 1000)**: Rules out **Grassland Seed Disperser**.
    
5. **Salinity Tolerance Test**: Examines the salt concentration range an organism can tolerate.
    
    - **(0, 5)**: Excludes **Deep Sea Predator** and **Coral Reef Predatory Fish**.
    - **(5, 15)**: Excludes **Deep Sea Predator** and **Coral Reef Predatory Fish**.
    - **(15, 35)**: Does not exclude any specific niches based on this outcome alone.
    
6. **Altitude Range Test**: Determines the altitude range within which the organism can survive.
    
    - **(0, 1000)**: Does not specifically exclude any niche.
    - **(1000, 3000)**: Does not exclude any niche specifically.
    - **(3000, 6000)**: Excludes **Deep Sea Predator** and **Coral Reef Predatory Fish**.

The outcomes of these investigations help ecologists narrow down the ecological niches by eliminating those that do not fit the observed data, enabling a better understanding of the organism's role in its ecosystem.
