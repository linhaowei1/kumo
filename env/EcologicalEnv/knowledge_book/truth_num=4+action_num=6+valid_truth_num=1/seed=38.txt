**Ecological Analysis Guide**

Welcome to this guide on ecological analysis, which is designed to offer a comprehensive understanding of various ecological niches and their corresponding investigations. This guide explains four ecological niches and six key investigations used to explore these environments. By understanding the interactions between ecological niches and experimental outcomes, we can rule out certain niches based on specific environmental observations.

### Ecological Niches

1. **Forest Understory Carnivore**:
   - Inhabitants of the forest floor, these carnivores are adapted to dense undergrowth, remaining inconspicuous as they hunt. Characterized by nocturnal or crepuscular activity, they occupy forest habitats but do not adapt well to aquatic or high-altitude regions.

2. **Deep Sea Predator**:
   - Found in the abyssal depths of oceans, deep sea predators are adapted to extreme pressure and darkness. They prevail in marine environments, unaffected by different salinity levels, often more photophilic due to the scarcity of light.

3. **Coral Reef Algae Grazer**:
   - These dwellers frequent the vibrant and dynamic regions of coral reefs, feeding on algae. Known for their salinity versatility, they thrive in various marine habitats, but remain photophobic, preferring shaded areas, and exhibit nocturnal activities.

4. **Polar Sea Mammal**:
   - Equipped for frigid polar waters, these mammals are able to withstand low temperatures and varied salinity. They are adaptable to both marine and forest environments but are restricted to regions with specific thermal requirements.

### Investigations and Outcomes

Through the following investigations, certain ecological niches can be systematically ruled out based on the outcomes observed:

1. **Salinity Tolerance Test**:
   - Tests an organism's survival across different salinity levels.
     - **Outcome Ranges**:
       - (0, 5) & (5, 15): Excludes Deep Sea Predator, Coral Reef Algae Grazer, Polar Sea Mammal.
       - (15, 35): No niches ruled out.

2. **Light Preference Test**:
   - Determines preference for light conditions.
     - **Outcome Preferences**:
       - Photophilic: Excludes Deep Sea Predator.
       - Photophobic: Excludes Coral Reef Algae Grazer.

3. **Habitat Observation**:
   - Identifies habitats where species are found.
     - **Outcome Habitats**:
       - High Altitude: Excludes Deep Sea Predator, Coral Reef Algae Grazer, Polar Sea Mammal.
       - Aquatic: Excludes Forest Understory Carnivore.
       - Desert: Excludes Deep Sea Predator, Coral Reef Algae Grazer, Polar Sea Mammal.
       - Forest: Excludes Deep Sea Predator, Polar Sea Mammal.
       - Urban: Excludes Deep Sea Predator.

4. **Altitude Range Test**:
   - Assesses organism distribution across altitudes.
     - **Outcome Ranges**:
       - (0, 1000) & (1000, 3000): No niches ruled out.
       - (3000, 6000): Excludes Deep Sea Predator, Forest Understory Carnivore.

5. **Nocturnal Activity Monitoring**:
   - Monitors active hours of organisms.
     - **Outcome Activities**:
       - Nocturnal: Excludes Coral Reef Algae Grazer.
       - Diurnal: No niches ruled out.

6. **Temperature Tolerance Test**:
   - Evaluates temperature adaptability.
     - **Outcome Ranges**:
       - (0, 10) & (10, 20): Excludes Coral Reef Algae Grazer.
       - (20, 30): Excludes Polar Sea Mammal.

By carefully observing these investigations, researchers can effectively narrow down which ecological niche is inaccurately associated with given conditions, allowing for a more focused analysis of biodiversity and species interaction in their natural environments.
