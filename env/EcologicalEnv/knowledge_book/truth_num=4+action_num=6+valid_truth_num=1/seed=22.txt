**Ecological Analysis Guide**

This guide aims to introduce you to the ecological niches and specific investigations used to understand and analyze these niches. By following this process, one can determine which ecological niches are not compatible with specific environmental outcomes. This exclusion approach highlights which niches can be ruled out based on various environmental tests and observations.

### Ecological Niches

1. **Taiga Omnivore**: This niche refers to organisms that inhabit the taiga biome, a cold and relatively barren region, with a diet that includes various food sources, typically both plant and animal matter.

2. **Polar Insectivore**: Organisms within this niche are adapted to cold polar environments and rely solely or primarily on insects as a food source.

3. **Arctic Carnivore**: This niche describes organisms found in arctic regions, which predominantly consume other animals.

4. **Freshwater Fish**: Organisms in this niche are aquatic and predominantly found in freshwater habitats, with various adaptations suitable for non-saline aquatic environments.

### Investigations and Their Outcomes

Below are the descriptions of specific investigations used to understand and exclude particular ecological niches based on observations:

1. **Temperature Tolerance Test**: This test investigates the range of temperatures an organism can withstand.
   - **Outcome (0, 10)**: No niche is ruled out.
   - **Outcome (10, 20)**: No niche is ruled out.
   - **Outcome (20, 30)**: Excludes 'Polar Insectivore', 'Arctic Carnivore', and 'Taiga Omnivore'.

2. **Light Preference Test**: This test evaluates an organism's preference for light environments.
   - **Outcome 'Photophilic'**: Excludes 'Polar Insectivore'.
   - **Outcome 'Photophobic'**: No niche is ruled out.

3. **Altitude Range Test**: This test assesses the range of altitudes an organism is naturally found at.
   - **Outcome (0, 1000)**: Excludes 'Taiga Omnivore'.
   - **Outcome (1000, 3000)**: No niche is ruled out.
   - **Outcome (3000, 6000)**: Excludes 'Freshwater Fish'.

4. **Dietary Analysis**: This analysis determines the dietary habits of organisms.
   - **Outcome 'Herbivorous Diet'**: Excludes 'Polar Insectivore' and 'Arctic Carnivore'.
   - **Outcome 'Carnivorous Diet'**: No niche is ruled out.
   - **Outcome 'Omnivorous Diet'**: No niche is ruled out.
   - **Outcome 'Filter Feeder Diet'**: Excludes 'Polar Insectivore' and 'Arctic Carnivore'.

5. **Salinity Tolerance Test**: This test identifies the range of salinity levels an organism is adapted to.
   - **Outcome (0, 5)**: No niche is ruled out.
   - **Outcome (5, 15)**: No niche is ruled out.
   - **Outcome (15, 35)**: Excludes 'Freshwater Fish'.

6. **Nocturnal Activity Monitoring**: This monitors whether organisms are active during nighttime.
   - **Outcome 'Nocturnal'**: No niche is ruled out.
   - **Outcome 'Diurnal'**: Excludes 'Polar Insectivore'.

### Conclusion

By using these tests and understanding the specified outcomes, researchers can effectively rule out incompatible ecological niches for given environmental conditions. This exclusion method assists in focusing on the most applicable niches based on environmental data, thereby refining ecological research and conservation strategies.
