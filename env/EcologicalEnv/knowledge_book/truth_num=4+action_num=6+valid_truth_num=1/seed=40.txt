# Ecological Analysis Guide

This guide is designed to introduce key ecological niches and related investigations, providing clear rules for excluding certain niches based on observed outcomes. By understanding these investigations and how their results can narrow down or rule out ecological niches, researchers and students can better comprehend complex ecological dynamics.

## Ecological Niches

1. **Arctic Herbivore**: This niche includes animals adapted to live and feed in cold Arctic environments. They primarily consume vegetation available in tundra ecosystems.

2. **Boreal Forest Frugivore**: Frugivores in boreal forests primarily consume fruits and are adapted to colder, northern forest environments, which are rich in conifer trees.

3. **Grassland Seed Disperser**: These are species that play a crucial role in spreading seeds across grasslands, thus aiding plant reproduction and diversity.

4. **Kelp Forest Herbivore**: Herbivores residing within kelp forests that consume marine plants and algae. They are adapted to the unique underwater ecosystem with its particular light and nutrient profiles.

## Investigations

Below are various investigations used to clarify or exclude ecological niches, along with their respective outcomes based on observed states.

### 1. Habitat Observation
This investigation looks at where the species are typically found. The habitat can be an indicator to exclude certain niches:

- **High Altitude Habitat**: If an organism is observed in high altitude habitats, rule out **Arctic Herbivore** and **Kelp Forest Herbivore** as possibilities.
- **Aquatic Habitat**: If an organism is observed in aquatic habitats, rule out **Boreal Forest Frugivore** and **Grassland Seed Disperser**.
- **Desert Habitat**: Rule out **Kelp Forest Herbivore** if encountered in desert habitats.
- **Forest Habitat**: Rule out **Kelp Forest Herbivore** if encountered in forest habitats.
- **Urban Habitat**: Rule out **Kelp Forest Herbivore** if observed in urban habitats.

### 2. Feeding Rate Measurement
This investigation measures how much and how fast a species feeds, which can indicate dietary and ecological functions.

- **(0, 10) feeding rate**: No rules can be established using this range.
- **(10, 100) feeding rate**: Rule out **Boreal Forest Frugivore**.
- **(100, 1000) feeding rate**: Rule out **Grassland Seed Disperser**.

### 3. Salinity Tolerance Test
This test measures a species' ability to tolerate different salinity levels.

- **(0, 5) salinity range**: Rule out **Kelp Forest Herbivore**.
- **(5, 15) salinity range**: Rule out **Kelp Forest Herbivore**.
- **(15, 35) salinity range**: No rules can be established using this range.

### 4. Light Preference Test
This test determines whether a species prefers high-light (photophilic) or low-light (photophobic) environments.

- **Photophilic**: No rules can be established.
- **Photophobic**: Rule out **Kelp Forest Herbivore**.

### 5. Altitude Range Test
This test identifies the altitudinal range a species is found in.

- **(0, 1000) altitude range**: No rules can be established within this range.
- **(1000, 3000) altitude range**: Rule out **Boreal Forest Frugivore**.
- **(3000, 6000) altitude range**: Rule out **Kelp Forest Herbivore**.

### 6. Nocturnal Activity Monitoring
Monitors whether a species is active mainly at night.

- **Nocturnal**: Rule out **Kelp Forest Herbivore**.
- **Diurnal**: No rules can be established.

By applying these investigations and understanding which niches to rule out based on observed outcomes, researchers can more efficiently determine the ecological role of a species within its environment.
