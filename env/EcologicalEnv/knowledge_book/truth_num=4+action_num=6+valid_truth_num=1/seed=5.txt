### Ecological Analysis Guide

This guide is designed to help you understand the complex relationships between various ecological niches and the results of specific ecological investigations. Each niche represents a distinct role within an ecosystem, and the investigations are methods to study particular aspects of these niches. The outcome of each investigation serves to exclude certain niches based on observed characteristics.

#### Ecological Niches

1. **Freshwater Fish**
   - These species inhabit freshwater environments like lakes, rivers, and streams.
   - They are adapted to live in water with low salt concentrations.

2. **Mangrove Tree Climber**
   - These organisms are typically found in mangrove forest ecosystems.
   - They have unique adaptations to climb and inhabit mangrove trees, often in brackish water conditions.

3. **Oceanic Pelagic Predator**
   - This niche includes species that live in the open ocean, often at considerable distances from the shore.
   - They are predators, hunting other marine organisms in pelagic (open sea) zones.

4. **Savanna Apex Predator**
   - These are top predators in savanna ecosystems.
   - They play critical roles in maintaining the balance of their habitats by controlling prey populations.

#### Ecological Investigations

1. **Temperature Tolerance Test**
   - This test assesses the temperature range an organism can tolerate.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - (0, 10)°C and (10, 20)°C: Excludes Mangrove Tree Climber
     - (20, 30)°C: No exclusions

2. **Feeding Rate Measurement**
   - This investigation evaluates the feeding rates of organisms.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - (0, 10) units: Excludes Oceanic Pelagic Predator, Savanna Apex Predator
     - (10, 100) units and (100, 1000) units: No exclusions

3. **Nocturnal Activity Monitoring**
   - This measures activity levels during nighttime.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - "Nocturnal": Excludes Mangrove Tree Climber
     - "Diurnal": No exclusions

4. **Salinity Tolerance Test**
   - This test determines the range of salinity levels an organism can endure.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - (0, 5) ppt: Excludes Oceanic Pelagic Predator, Mangrove Tree Climber
     - (5, 15) ppt: Excludes Oceanic Pelagic Predator
     - (15, 35) ppt: Excludes Freshwater Fish, Mangrove Tree Climber

5. **Habitat Observation**
   - This involves observing the natural habitats in which organisms reside.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - High Altitude Habitat: Excludes Oceanic Pelagic Predator, Mangrove Tree Climber
     - Aquatic Habitat: Excludes Savanna Apex Predator
     - Desert Habitat: Excludes Freshwater Fish
     - Forest Habitat: Excludes Freshwater Fish, Oceanic Pelagic Predator, Mangrove Tree Climber
     - Urban Habitat: Excludes Freshwater Fish

6. **Dietary Analysis**
   - This analysis investigates the dietary preferences of organisms.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - Herbivorous Diet: Excludes Oceanic Pelagic Predator, Savanna Apex Predator
     - Carnivorous Diet: Excludes Mangrove Tree Climber
     - Omnivorous Diet: No exclusions
     - Filter Feeder Diet: Excludes Savanna Apex Predator

### Conclusion

This guide provides a framework to interpret the outcomes of ecological investigations by excluding certain niches based on observed characteristics. By understanding which niches are not suitable under specific conditions, researchers can better identify the potential roles and adaptability of organisms within their ecosystems.
