# Ecological Analysis Guide

This guide introduces a framework for understanding various ecological niches through specific investigative tests. By analyzing the outcomes of these tests, certain ecological niches can be effectively ruled out, aiding in the precise identification of species roles within their environments.

## Ecological Niches

1. **Polar Insectivore**: This niche encompasses organisms that primarily feed on insects in polar regions. These organisms must be adapted to extreme cold and can exploit the relatively scarce food resources available in polar ecosystems.

2. **Coral Reef Predatory Fish**: These are fish that inhabit coral reefs and primarily feed on other marine organisms. They play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of species within coral reef ecosystems.

3. **Alpine Herbivore**: These organisms are herbivorous animals residing in mountainous, alpine regions. They are adapted to thrive at high altitudes with low temperatures and limited vegetation.

4. **Polar Sea Mammal**: This niche consists of mammals that live in polar seas, such as seals and whales, adapted to cold waters and often significant divers, feeding on fish and other marine life.

## Investigations

### 1. Temperature Tolerance Test
This test determines the temperature range within which an organism can survive.

- **Outcomes:**
  - (0, 10)°C: Rules out *Coral Reef Predatory Fish*.
  - (10, 20)°C: No niches are ruled out.
  - (20, 30)°C: Rules out *Alpine Herbivore*, *Polar Insectivore*, and *Polar Sea Mammal*.

### 2. Altitude Range Test
This investigation assesses the range of altitudes an organism can inhabit.

- **Outcomes:**
  - (0, 1000)m: Rules out *Alpine Herbivore*.
  - (1000, 3000)m: No niches are ruled out.
  - (3000, 6000)m: Rules out *Coral Reef Predatory Fish*.

### 3. Light Preference Test
Examines whether an organism prefers environments with high (photophilic) or low (photophobic) light conditions.

- **Outcomes:**
  - Photophilic: Rules out *Polar Insectivore*.
  - Photophobic: No niches are ruled out.

### 4. Nocturnal Activity Monitoring
Monitors whether an organism is active during night (nocturnal) or day (diurnal).

- **Outcomes:**
  - Nocturnal: No niches are ruled out.
  - Diurnal: Rules out *Polar Insectivore*.

### 5. Salinity Tolerance Test
This test evaluates the range of salinity levels an organism can tolerate.

- **Outcomes:**
  - (0, 5) ppt: Rules out *Coral Reef Predatory Fish* and *Polar Sea Mammal*.
  - (5, 15) ppt: Rules out *Coral Reef Predatory Fish* and *Polar Sea Mammal*.
  - (15, 35) ppt: No niches are ruled out.

### 6. Dietary Analysis
Assesses the dietary patterns, such as herbivorous, carnivorous, omnivorous, or filter feeding, of organisms.

- **Outcomes:**
  - Herbivorous Diet: Rules out *Coral Reef Predatory Fish* and *Polar Insectivore*.
  - Carnivorous Diet: Rules out *Alpine Herbivore*.
  - Omnivorous Diet: No niches are ruled out.
  - Filter Feeder Diet: Rules out *Polar Insectivore*.

By understanding and applying these investigative tests, researchers can exclude certain ecological niches based on specific environmental observations, leading to more accurate ecological insights.

This comprehensive approach ensures the selection of correctly adapted species to their niches within the ecosystem, promoting ecological integrity and balance.
