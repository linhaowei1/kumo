This ecological analysis guide provides an overview of different ecological niches and the associated investigations used to understand them. The aim is to observe certain outcomes and rule out certain niches based on these findings. Here, we outline the niches and investigations and explain the exclusion process according to the outcomes observed during each investigation.

### Ecological Niches

1. **Open Ocean Plankton Feeder**:
   - Typically inhabits the vast open waters and primarily feeds on plankton.
   
2. **Tropical Rainforest Frugivore**:
   - Lives in tropical rainforest ecosystems, with a diet predominantly consisting of fruit.

3. **Mountain Omnivore**:
   - Occupies mountainous regions and has a diverse diet that includes both plant and animal matter.

4. **Wetland Amphibian**:
   - Inhabits wetland areas and is adapted to environments with varying water conditions.

### Investigations and Rule-Out Process

1. **Dietary Analysis**:
   - This investigation assesses dietary patterns, whether the study subject has an herbivorous, carnivorous, omnivorous, or filter feeder diet.
   - **Rule-outs**:
     - If an "Omnivorous Diet" is observed, rule out the 'Open Ocean Plankton Feeder'.
     - If a "Filter Feeder Diet" is detected, rule out the 'Mountain Omnivore'.

2. **Salinity Tolerance Test**:
   - Examines the range of salinity levels in which the organism can survive.
   - **Rule-outs**:
     - If a salinity tolerance range of (15, 35) is found, eliminate 'Wetland Amphibian' as a potential niche.

3. **Nocturnal Activity Monitoring**:
   - Observes whether the organism is active during the night (nocturnal) or day (diurnal).
   - **Rule-outs**:
     - When nocturnal activity is observed, eliminate 'Tropical Rainforest Frugivore'.

4. **Altitude Range Test**:
   - Determines the altitude at which an organism thrives.
   - **Rule-outs**:
     - If an altitude range of (1000, 3000) or (3000, 6000) is noted, rule out 'Wetland Amphibian'.

5. **Habitat Observation**:
   - Involves observing the natural habitat where the organism resides.
   - **Rule-outs**:
     - When a "High Altitude Habitat" is seen, exclude 'Wetland Amphibian'.
     - When an "Aquatic Habitat" is noted, eliminate 'Mountain Omnivore'.
     - If a "Desert Habitat" is observed, rule out 'Wetland Amphibian' and 'Tropical Rainforest Frugivore'.
     - On observing a "Forest Habitat", exclude 'Open Ocean Plankton Feeder'.
     - When "Urban Habitat" is observed, rule out 'Mountain Omnivore' and 'Tropical Rainforest Frugivore'.

6. **Behavioral Study**:
   - Studies whether the organism exhibits solitary or social behavior.
   - **Rule-outs**:
     - If solitary behavior is seen, eliminate 'Mountain Omnivore'.

### Conclusion

This guide explains how certain investigative outcomes can help rule out non-fitting ecological niches, refining our understanding of an organism's ecological role. By systematically applying these exclusion rules, researchers can accurately determine the ecological niche of a subject, thereby contributing to our broader understanding of ecosystem dynamics.
