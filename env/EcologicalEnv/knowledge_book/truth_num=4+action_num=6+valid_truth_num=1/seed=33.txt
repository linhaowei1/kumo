# Ecological Analysis Guide

This guide provides an overview of specific ecological niches and investigative tests used to understand their ecological constraints. The focus is on how certain outcomes from these investigations can exclude or rule out certain ecological niches from consideration.

## Ecological Niches:

1. **Desert Herbivore**: 
   - Typically found in dry, arid environments, adept at obtaining water and nutrients from sparse vegetation.
   
2. **Arctic Sea Ice Carnivore**: 
   - Predominantly located in polar regions, dependent on sea ice for hunting and habitat.

3. **Forest Understory Carnivore**: 
   - Inhabit the lower levels of forest ecosystems and rely on the availability of prey within dense vegetation.

4. **High Altitude Bird**: 
   - Adapted to life at high elevations, these birds are skilled at navigating and surviving in mountainous terrains.

## Investigative Tests:

1. **Salinity Tolerance Test**:
   - Assesses the ability of organisms to survive in various salinity levels.  
   - **Rule-Outs**:
     - Salinity range (0-5): Arctic Sea Ice Carnivore.
     - Salinity range (5-15): Arctic Sea Ice Carnivore.
     - Salinity range (15-35): No niches ruled out.

2. **Altitude Range Test**:
   - Determines which elevations an organism can inhabit.
   - **Rule-Outs**:
     - Altitude range (0-1000): High Altitude Bird.
     - Altitude range (1000-3000): Desert Herbivore.
     - Altitude range (3000-6000): Desert Herbivore, Forest Understory Carnivore.

3. **Light Preference Test**:
   - Evaluates the organism's preference for light or dark environments.
   - **Rule-Outs**:
     - Photophilic (light-loving): Arctic Sea Ice Carnivore.
     - Photophobic (prefers darkness): High Altitude Bird.

4. **Temperature Tolerance Test**:
   - Measures the temperature range in which organisms can survive.
   - **Rule-Outs**:
     - Temperature range (0-10°C): Desert Herbivore.
     - Temperature range (10-20°C): Desert Herbivore.
     - Temperature range (20-30°C): Arctic Sea Ice Carnivore.

5. **Habitat Observation**:
   - Involves the direct study of the habitats in which organisms are typically found.
   - **Rule-Outs**:
     - High Altitude Habitat: Desert Herbivore.
     - Aquatic Habitat: Desert Herbivore, Forest Understory Carnivore.
     - Desert Habitat: No niches ruled out.
     - Forest Habitat: Arctic Sea Ice Carnivore, High Altitude Bird, Desert Herbivore.
     - Urban Habitat: Desert Herbivore.

6. **Feeding Rate Measurement**:
   - Quantifies the rate at which organisms consume food.
   - **Rule-Outs**:
     - Feeding rate (0-10): No niches ruled out.
     - Feeding rate (10-100): No niches ruled out.
     - Feeding rate (100-1000): Forest Understory Carnivore.

By applying this comprehensive framework of ecological tests and rule-outs, researchers can effectively narrow down the list of possible ecological niches pertinent to their study by systematically excluding incompatible niches based on the observed outcomes.
