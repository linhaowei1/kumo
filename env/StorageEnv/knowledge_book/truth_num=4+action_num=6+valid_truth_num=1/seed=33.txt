### Data Storage Technology Guidebook

#### Introduction
In the future of digital storage technology, several innovative media have emerged, each with unique characteristics and advantages. This guide will explore four advanced storage media and the tests used to analyze them. By understanding these storage technologies and their diagnostic evaluations, we can effectively determine which media to exclude in certain testing scenarios.

#### Storage Media
1. **Skyrmion Memory**:
   - Skyrmion Memory utilizes magnetic skyrmions — tiny, spin-aligned whirlpools — to store data. These structures promise high density and stability in storage applications.

2. **Plasmonic Storage**:
   - Plasmonic Storage leverages surface plasmons to achieve high-speed data writing and reading. The use of light-induced electronic oscillations can enhance data processing rates.

3. **Polymer Memory**:
   - Polymer Memory involves using polymer-based materials to store data. Known for flexibility and potential low-cost production, it can lead to novel electronic applications.

4. **Topological Insulator Memory**:
   - This advanced memory uses materials known as topological insulators, which conduct electricity on surfaces while preventing flow in their bulk. This unique property fosters low-power consumption applications.

#### Tests and Outcomes
To assess the properties of these storage media, several state-of-the-art diagnostic tests are employed. Each test results in outcomes that can help in ruling out certain media:

1. **Optical Laser Scan**:
   - This test measures the reflectivity of the storage medium.

     - **High Reflectivity**: Excludes Polymer Memory.
     - **No Reflectivity**: Excludes Plasmonic Storage.
    
2. **Quantum Entanglement Test**:
   - This test examines the presence of quantum entanglement within the medium.

     - **Entanglement Observed**: Excludes Skyrmion Memory.
     - **Entanglement Not Observed**: Excludes Topological Insulator Memory.
     
3. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**:
   - MRI scans assess the magnetic properties and imaging structure of the media.

     - **Magnetic Signal from 0.0 to 0.5**: Excludes Skyrmion Memory.
     
4. **Electron Microscopy Imaging**:
   - This technique provides high-resolution imaging to detect electron densities.

     - **High Electron Density**: Excludes Polymer Memory.
     
5. **Electrical Resistance Check**:
   - Determines the electrical conductive properties by measuring resistance.

     - **Resistance from 0 to 10 Ohms**: Excludes Topological Insulator Memory.
     
6. **Thermal Conductivity Measurement**:
   - This test measures how well heat is conducted through the material.

     - **Conductivity from 0 to 100 units**: Excludes Polymer Memory.

#### Conclusion
By understanding the unique properties of each storage medium and the diagnostic outcomes from various tests, we can effectively exclude certain media under specific observations. This method of elimination aids in accurately identifying suitable storage technologies for future digital applications. Use this guide as a reference to navigate the intricate landscape of advanced data storage solutions.
