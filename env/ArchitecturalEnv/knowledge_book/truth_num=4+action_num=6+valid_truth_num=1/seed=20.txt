# Guidebook for Architectural Analysis

This guidebook is designed to help you analyze and understand architectural styles by examining structural patterns and historical design references. We'll focus on four prominent architectural styles: **Modernist**, **Neo-Gothic**, **Beaux-Arts**, and **Queen Anne**. Through various criteria, you'll be able to determine which styles can be excluded based on observed outcomes. 

### Architectural Styles Overview

1. **Modernist**: Known for its emphasis on simplicity and functionality, Modernist architecture often incorporates minimalistic design, flat roofs, and artificial lighting. Historical references are minimal or abstract.

2. **Neo-Gothic**: This style is characterized by intricate detailing, pointed arches, and a revival of Gothic aesthetics. Contrary to Modernist architecture, Neo-Gothic often avoids overt references to contemporary styles.

3. **Beaux-Arts**: A style that focuses on grandeur and classical details, Beaux-Arts architecture typically features symmetrical designs and the deliberate exposure of structural elements for decorative purposes.

4. **Queen Anne**: Distinguished by its eclectic and often picturesque aesthetics, Queen Anne architecture commonly incorporates a variety of textures and materials, including prominent use of flat roofs.

### Structural Pattern Comparisons

To determine which architectural style an observed structure might not belong to, utilize the following comparisons:

#### 1. Evaluate Roof Design
- **If a Flat Roof is observed**, rule out: **Queen Anne**.
- **If a Pitched Roof is observed**, rule out: **Modernist**.

#### 2. Study Historical References
- **If Historical Allusions are present**, rule out: **Modernist**.
- **If No Historical References are observed**, rule out: **Neo-Gothic**.

#### 3. Examine Structural Exposures
- **If an Exposed Structure is noted**, rule out: **Beaux-Arts**.

#### 4. Check Structural Framework
- **If Exposed Structural Elements are noted**, rule out: **Beaux-Arts**.

#### 5. Assess Use of Light
- **If Artificial Lighting Emphasis is noted**, rule out: **Modernist**.

#### 6. Evaluate Spatial Organization
- **If Hierarchical Spaces are present**, rule out: **Modernist**.

### Applying the Guide

By carefully observing a structure's features and comparing them to the above criteria, you can effectively narrow down the architectural style options. Each identified feature excludes certain styles, allowing you to eliminate possibilities and focus on what remains.

For instance, if you come across a building with a flat roof and no historical references, you can confidently rule out both Queen Anne and Neo-Gothic styles as potential classifications for the structure.

### Conclusion

This guidebook aims to streamline the process of architectural analysis by clarifying which styles can be confidently excluded based on observable structural and stylistic attributes. By understanding these exclusion criteria, you will be able to assess architectural styles with greater accuracy and confidence.
