## Introduction to Architectural Styles

This guidebook explores four distinctive architectural styles: Prairie School, Second Empire, Deconstructivist, and Tudor Revival. Understanding these styles involves examining their structural patterns and historical design origins.

### Prairie School
Emerging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States, Prairie School architecture is characterized by horizontal lines, flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves, and open interior spaces. It emphasizes harmony with the surrounding environment, often employing natural materials.

### Second Empire
Second Empire architecture, popular in the mid-19th century, is known for its Mansard roofs, ornate detailing, and symmetrical facades. It draws inspiration from French architectural trends during the reign of Napoleon III, focusing on grandeur and elegance.

### Deconstructivist
Deconstructivism, gaining prominence in the late 20th century, is noted for its radical departure from traditional architectural forms. It often features fragmented or distorted shapes and a lack of symmetry, challenging conventional geometric forms.

### Tudor Revival
Reviving elements from the medieval Tudor period, Tudor Revival architecture is recognizable by its steeply pitched gable roofs, embellished doorways, and half-timbered exteriors. It became popular in the United Kingdom and the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

## Structural Pattern Comparisons and Design References

In assessing architectural styles, the following comparisons are key in ruling out which styles do not fit specific structural outcomes:

### 1. Evaluate Roof Design
- **Flat Roof**: If a flat roof is observed, eliminate Tudor Revival as a possible style.
- **Pitched Roof**: No specific styles are ruled out by pitched roofs; this feature is neutral in ruling out our styles.

### 2. Survey Floor Plan Layout
- **Open Plan**: An open plan design leads to eliminating Prairie School from consideration.
- **Compartmentalized Plan**: This layout does not specifically exclude any of the styles under review.

### 3. Review Use of Geometric Forms
- **Rectilinear Forms**: If rectilinear forms are found, Deconstructivist styling should be ruled out.
- **Curvilinear Forms**: This form does not eliminate any styles in our list of interest.

### 4. Measure Proportions and Symmetry
- **Perfect Symmetry**: Observing perfect symmetry excludes Deconstructivist from the potential stylistic choices.
- **Asymmetrical Design**: Does not provide grounds to exclude any style from consideration. 

### 5. Check Use of Natural Materials
- **Predominant Use of Natural Materials**: No exclusions result from the predominant use of natural materials.
- **Industrial Materials**: The use of industrial materials means Prairie School should be ruled out.

### 6. Calculate Floor Area
- **Floor Area (0 - 500 square feet)**: Does not rule out any styles.
- **Floor Area (500 - 2000 square feet)**: If within this range, eliminate Prairie School as a choice.
- **Floor Area (2000 - 10000 square feet)**: This range does not exclude any specific styles.

## Conclusion

The guidebook provides a structured approach to eliminate certain architectural styles based on specific outcomes observed during analysis. By understanding these rule-out principles, analysts and enthusiasts can more effectively identify and differentiate between various architectural styles.
