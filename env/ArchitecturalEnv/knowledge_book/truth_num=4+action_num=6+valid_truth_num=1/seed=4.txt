# A Guidebook to Architectural Analysis

In this guidebook, we delve into a selection of remarkable architectural styles – Art Deco, Cathedral Styles, Beaux-Arts, and Eco-Architecture. We explore these styles through a systematic approach by examining specific structural patterns and historical design references. Our focus lies in understanding how the attributes of these styles can guide us in eliminating certain possibilities through observations in architecture. 

## Architectural Styles Overview

### Art Deco
Art Deco is characterized by its sleek, geometric lines and a focus on ornamental design. It flourished in the early 20th century and is often recognized by its avant-garde use of materials and stylistic elements.

### Cathedral Styles
These refer to the grand, monumental designs often associated with religious buildings. Characterized by immense scale, intricate detailing, and pointed arches, these styles are designed to draw the eyes upward.

### Beaux-Arts
This style emerged from the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and is known for its grandiose symmetry, classical lines, and elaborate detailing. Beaux-Arts combines traditional architectural elements with an eclectic historicism.

### Eco-Architecture
A modern approach focusing on sustainability, these structures integrate environmental considerations into design and construction, often featuring innovative techniques to minimize ecological footprints.

## Architectural Comparisons and Elimination Guide

### Check Structural Framework
This comparison looks at how structures are visibly supported:
- **Exposed Structural Elements**: If observed, eliminate **Beaux-Arts** as they typically conceal their structural elements behind decorative facades.

### Investigate Use of Color
This analysis reviews the color schemes used in the design:
- **Monochromatic**: An observation here rules out **Art Deco**, which is known for bold, striking color contrasts.

### Calculate Floor Area
Evaluating a building's footprint can provide clues about its function and style:
- **Floor Area (2000 - 10000)**: When observed, this range of floor area rules out **Cathedral Styles**, as they are often expansive and exceed this range significantly.

### Analyze Window Shapes
Examining the forms of windows can be quite revealing:
- **Pointed Arches**: This pattern rules out **Art Deco**, which favors streamlined, geometric shapes rather than traditional, pointed forms.
- **Asymmetrical Windows**: If present, eliminate **Beaux-Arts**, which emphasize symmetry and regularity.

### Analyze Column Orders
Columns are integral to architectural style:
- **Non-Classical Columns**: When seen, exclude **Beaux-Arts** due to its preference for classical order and traditional column structures.

### Examine Sustainability Features
This looks into the design and material choices regarding ecological impact:
- **Conventional Design**: If conventional, non-sustainable features are observed, rule out **Eco-Architecture**, as it focuses on sustainability and ecological integration.

## Conclusion

Through this systematic analytical approach, we can understand and eliminate specific architectural possibilities based on observed traits and patterns in design. By applying these principles, one can more clearly identify and classify structures within the diverse realm of architectural styles. This guide should serve as a foundation for building a deeper appreciation and understanding of how historical and modern influences shape the built environment.
