# Guidebook for Architectural Analysis

This guidebook is designed to introduce the architectural styles of Skyscraper Styles, Art Nouveau, Organic Architecture, and International Style, along with a detailed comparison based on structural patterns and historical design references. The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of each style and how they compare in specific architectural aspects.

## Architectural Styles Overview

### Skyscraper Styles
Skyscrapers are characterized by their towering heights and urban presence. While they vary greatly in aesthetic, they often incorporate state-of-the-art engineering techniques to achieve impressive vertical scale.

### Art Nouveau
Art Nouveau is known for its ornamental style that emphasizes natural forms and structures. This style integrates decorative arts into architecture, characterized by intricate detailing and fluid, organic designs.

### Organic Architecture
Organic Architecture seeks harmony between human habitation and the natural world. It emphasizes the integration of buildings with their surroundings using natural forms and materials, promoting sustainability and environmental integration.

### International Style
The International Style is marked by its simplicity and functionalism. This style focuses on volume over mass, balance rather than preconceived symmetry, and the expulsion of applied decoration, often resulting in modernist structural expressions.

## Structural Pattern Comparisons

To effectively analyze architectural styles, we compare them based on several key structural patterns:

### 1. Review Use of Geometric Forms
- **Rectilinear Forms**: Styles such as Organic Architecture and Art Nouveau are excluded when rectilinear forms are predominantly used.
- **Curvilinear Forms**: The International Style is ruled out when curvilinear forms are the primary geometric structure.

### 2. Examine Structural Exposures
- **Exposed Structure**: If a structure's form is overtly displayed, Art Nouveau is eliminated as a fitting style.
- **Concealed Structure**: No specific styles are excluded, indicating a versatility in this aspect.

### 3. Calculate Floor Area
- **(0, 500)**: Skyscraper Styles are ruled out for structures with a floor area within this range, typically indicative of smaller, more intimate spaces.

### 4. Evaluate Roof Design
- **Flat Roof**: No styles are directly excluded by the presence of a flat roof, showcasing a commonality across styles.
- **Pitched Roof**: The International Style is ruled out when the design incorporates a pitched roof, giving preference to functional, flat designs.

### 5. Evaluate Spatial Organization
- **Hierarchical Spaces**: Styles like the International Style are eliminated when such spatial organization is present, which values fluid and continuous spaces.
- **Fluid Spaces**: No direct exclusion of styles, affirming potential overlaps in spatial design.

### 6. Assess Building Height
- **(0, 10)**: Skyscraper Styles are excluded, focusing instead on smaller-scale structures, which do not exhibit the towering characteristics of skyscrapers.

By examining these structural patterns and historical references, architects and enthusiasts can better identify the most plausible architectural styles for any given structure. Through this guidebook, users can apply a systematic approach to rule out incompatible styles based on key architectural features and traits.
