# Guidebook for Architectural Analysis: Styles and Structural Patterns

## Introduction
Architectural analysis involves the study and interpretation of various architectural styles, evaluating their structural patterns, historical influences, and design principles. This guidebook aims to introduce four distinct architectural styles—Prairie School, Minimalist, Organic Architecture, and Tudor Revival—by examining them through specific structural pattern comparisons. Importantly, this guide uses a rule-out method to eliminate architectural styles based on particular design attributes.

## Architectural Styles Overview

### Prairie School
- **Historical Context**: Emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, predominantly in the American Midwest. It reflects the Arts and Crafts movement and is noted for its emphasis on horizontal lines and integration with the landscape.
- **Key Features**: Open floor plans, strong horizontal lines, flat or gently sloping roofs, use of natural materials.

### Minimalist
- **Historical Context**: Developed in the late 20th century, Minimalism is characterized by simplicity and functionality, stripping designs down to their essential elements.
- **Key Features**: Clean lines, uncluttered spaces, a monochromatic color palette, and a focus on natural light.

### Organic Architecture
- **Historical Context**: Popularized by Frank Lloyd Wright, Organic Architecture seeks harmony between human habitation and the natural world through design approaches sympathetic to nature.
- **Key Features**: Use of natural materials, integration with site, fluid and flowing forms.

### Tudor Revival
- **Historical Context**: Inspired by medieval English architecture, this style flourished in the 20th century, particularly in residential architecture.
- **Key Features**: Steeply pitched gable roofs, masonry or stucco exteriors, decorative half-timbering.

## Structural Pattern Comparisons

### 1. Evaluate Roof Design
- **Observation: Flat Roof**
  - **Rule-out**: Tudor Revival is excluded as it typically features steeply pitched roofs.

- **Observation: Pitched Roof**
  - **Rule-out**: No exclusions noted.

### 2. Survey Floor Plan Layout
- **Observation: Open Plan**
  - **Rule-out**: Prairie School is excluded when an open plan is observed, eliminating it as a possibility.

- **Observation: Compartmentalized Plan**
  - **Rule-out**: Minimalist is excluded as it favors open, flowing spaces over compartmentalization.

### 3. Review Use of Geometric Forms
- **Observation: Rectilinear Forms**
  - **Rule-out**: Organic Architecture is excluded when rectilinear forms are observed, as it typically prefers fluid and flowing forms.

- **Observation: Curvilinear Forms**
  - **Rule-out**: No exclusions noted.

### 4. Measure Window-to-Wall Ratio
- **Observation: Ratio between 0.0 and 0.2**
  - **Rule-out**: No exclusions noted.

- **Observation: Ratio between 0.2 and 0.5**
  - **Rule-out**: No exclusions noted.

- **Observation: Ratio between 0.5 and 1.0**
  - **Rule-out**: Minimalist is excluded as it typically features more restrained fenestration.

### 5. Calculate Floor Area
- **Observation: Small floor area (0 to 500 sq ft)**
  - **Rule-out**: No exclusions noted.

- **Observation: Medium floor area (500 to 2000 sq ft)**
  - **Rule-out**: Prairie School is excluded when a medium floor area is observed, eliminating it as a possibility.

- **Observation: Large floor area (2000 to 10000 sq ft)**
  - **Rule-out**: No exclusions noted.

### 6. Check Structural Framework
- **Observation: Exposed Structural Elements**
  - **Rule-out**: No exclusions noted.

- **Observation: Hidden Structural Elements**
  - **Rule-out**: No exclusions noted.

- **Observation: Organic Structural Forms**
  - **Rule-out**: Minimalist is excluded as it tends to not prominently feature organic structural forms.

## Conclusion
By applying these structural pattern comparisons and exclusions, architectural analysis can effectively narrow down feasible architectural styles for specific design attributes observed in a building. This guidebook should serve as a tool for identifying key characteristics of buildings and understanding which architectural styles are plausible or improbable based on observed features and design patterns.
