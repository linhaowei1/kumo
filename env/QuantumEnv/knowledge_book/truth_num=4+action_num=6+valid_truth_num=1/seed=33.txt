# Quantum Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to various quantum states and experiments. By understanding the outcomes of certain experiments, we can rule out specific quantum states, thereby gaining insights into the true nature of quantum systems. The quantum states discussed here include the Excited State, Quantum Decoherence, GHZ State, and Quantum Hall State. The experiments covered in this guide include Entanglement Verification, Quantum Hall Effect Measurement, Rydberg Atom Spectroscopy, Rabi Oscillation Measurement, Aharonov-Bohm Effect Measurement, and Quantum Cryptography Test.

## Quantum States

### Excited State
An Excited State in quantum mechanics is when a quantum system, such as an atom or molecule, absorbs energy and transitions to a higher energy level. This is typically observed following energy absorption, such as from photons.

### Quantum Decoherence
Quantum Decoherence is a process wherein a quantum system loses its coherent superposition state, often due to interactions with its environment. This loss leads to the emergence of classical behavior and is a key concept in understanding the transition from quantum to classical physics.

### GHZ State
GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) State refers to a specific entangled state involving three or more particles. This state exhibits distinct correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics, making it a fundamental concept in quantum entanglement studies.

### Quantum Hall State
A Quantum Hall State is observed in two-dimensional electron systems subject to low temperatures and strong magnetic fields. It is characterized by the quantization of the Hall conductance and is pivotal in understanding quantum transport phenomena.

## Experiments and Outcomes

### Aharonov-Bohm Effect Measurement
This experiment investigates the phase shift in a quantum particle's wave function due to electromagnetic potentials.

- **Phase Shift Detected**: Rules out Quantum Decoherence.
- **No Phase Shift**: No states are ruled out.

### Quantum Cryptography Test
