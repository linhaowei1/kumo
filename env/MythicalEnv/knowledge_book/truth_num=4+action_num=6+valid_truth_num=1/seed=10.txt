## **Guidebook to Mythical Creatures and Detection Methods**

Welcome to the world of mythical creatures and the ancient art of their detection. Here, you'll learn about some of the fascinating creatures from lore and the methods used to identify them, or, rather, to exclude certain creatures based on the findings of these methods. By understanding what each sign or clue does *not* indicate, we form a clearer picture of what might be lingering just beyond our perception.

## Mythical Creatures

1. **Wraith**
   - Wraiths are spectral beings often tied to darkness and death. They are known for haunting places filled with sorrow and are often seen as harbingers of doom or reminders of mortality.

2. **Banshee**
   - In Celtic mythology, the Banshee is a female spirit known for her mourning wail. Often a predictor of death, her cries are feared by those who hear them.

3. **Chimera**
   - A Chimera is a monstrous hybrid creature depicted in ancient Greek mythology, typically combining aspects of a lion, goat, and serpent. This fire-breathing beast is known for its terrifying appearance.

4. **Satyr**
   - Satyrs, part of Greek lore, are half-human and half-goat beings associated with nature, music, and revelry. They typically inhabit woodland areas and are known for their playful and sometimes mischievous nature.

## Detection Methods and Lore Checks

Here are the methods used to detect and rule out various mythical creatures based on physical signs or ancient knowledge:

1. **Analyze Claw Marks**
   - Utilizing this method involves examining any claw marks present. 
     - **Deep Gouges** - Rules out Satyrs.
     - **Fine Scratches** - Rules out Chimeras.
     - **No Claw Marks** - Rules out Banshees, as they do not leave claw marks.

2. **Analyze Scale Samples**
   - This involves looking for and analyzing scales.
     - **Hard Scales** - No specific creature is ruled out.
     - **Soft Scales** - No specific creature is ruled out.
     - **No Scales** - Rules out Banshees, as they do not possess scales.

3. **Read Encrypted Runes**
   - Deciphering ancient runes can provide clues.
     - **Runes Deciphered** - No specific creature is ruled out.
     - **Runes Indecipherable** - Rules out Chimeras.

4. **Consult Ancient Tomes**
   - This method involves searching historical texts for references.
     - **Reference Found** - No specific creature is ruled out.
     - **No Reference** - Rules out Chimeras when no mention is found.

5. **Search for Illusions**
   - This involves detecting any magical illusions in the area.
     - **Illusions Detected** - Rules out Banshees, often associated with such illusions.
     - **No Illusions** - No specific creature is ruled out.

6. **Examine Residual Footprints**
   - Analyzing residual footprints left by creatures.
     - **Large Footprints** - No specific creature is ruled out.
     - **Small Footprints** - Rules out Chimeras, suggesting they are not present.
     - **No Footprints** - Rules out Wraiths, as they leave no physical trail.

By using these detection methods, we exclude certain mythical creatures based on the evidence or lack thereof. This process of elimination allows adventurers and scholars to narrow down the possibilities and perhaps identify the true nature of the creature they are dealing with. Understanding what cannot be may sometimes lead you closer to what is possible.
