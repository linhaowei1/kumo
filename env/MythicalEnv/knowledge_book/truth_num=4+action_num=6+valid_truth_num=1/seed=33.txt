# Guidebook to Identifying Mythical Creatures

Welcome to the realm of mythical creatures, where understanding the nuances between various entities can be both challenging and fascinating. This guidebook will introduce you to some of the most enigmatic mythological beings and provide a thorough explanation of the detection methods and lore reference checks necessary to discern their presence. In this guide, we will discuss four mystical creatures: Wraiths, Minotaurs, Harpies, and Elementals, and explain how to utilize specialized detection techniques to rule out or exclude certain beings based on specific outcomes.

## Mythical Creatures

### Wraith
Wraiths are ghostly, ethereal beings often associated with death or the afterlife. They are known for their intangible presence and haunting nature. Typically, wraiths are silent and difficult to detect by conventional means, making them elusive inhabitants of the supernatural world.

### Minotaur
The Minotaur is a powerful creature from Greek mythology, depicted as having the body of a man and the head of a bull. Usually found in labyrinthine environments, Minotaurs are known for their strength and aggression. They are physical, tangible beings with traces often left behind.

### Harpy
Harpies are mythological creatures that combine the features of birds and humans. Generally described as having the body of a bird and the face of a woman, they are famed for their agility and swift, feathered flight. Harpies are often associated with tempestuous winds.

### Elemental
Elementals are spirit-like entities tied to the fundamental elements of nature: earth, air, fire, and water. Each Elemental embodies the traits of its respective element, resulting in a diverse array of manifestations and a lack of tangible physicality, making them both powerful and elusive.
