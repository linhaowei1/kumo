**Guidebook to Mythical Creatures and Magical Detection Methods**

Welcome to the world of mythical creatures and the methods used to detect and understand their presence. In this guide, we'll explore four mythical creatures—Ghost, Manticore, Ogre, and Kraken—and the magical detection methods or lore reference checks applicable to these creatures. This handbook is designed to help detect the presence of mythical beings by identifying what findings rule out certain creatures.

### Mythical Creatures Overview

1. **Ghost**: Ethereal and often elusive, ghosts are spirits that typically do not leave physical traces. They are known for their spectral nature and can be detected through subtle, non-physical signs.

2. **Manticore**: A formidable creature with a lion's body, a human head, and often a tail with venomous spines. The manticore is legendary for its fierceness and cunning nature.

3. **Ogre**: Usually depicted as large, brutish creatures with immense strength. Ogres are often found in folktales causing destruction and living in isolated areas.

4. **Kraken**: A giant sea monster said to dwell off the coasts and engage ships. Its immense size and monstrous appearance are the stuff of sailors' nightmares.

### Magical Detection Methods and Lore Reference Checks

To discover which, if any, of these creatures are present, various magical detection methods can be employed. Here's how to interpret each method based on findings to rule out possibilities:

#### 1. Analyze Claw Marks
- **Deep Gouges**: No creatures are ruled out by deep gouges alone.
- **Fine Scratches**: Rules out the presence of a **Manticore**, as fine scratches are unlikely given its known features.
- **No Claw Marks**: All creatures could still be possible; no ruling out occurs here.

#### 2. Inspect Footprints
- **Hoof Prints**: Rules out the **Kraken** as they do not leave hoof prints.
- **Clawed Prints**: Does not specifically rule out any creature, keeping all possibilities open.
- **No Footprints**: Rules out the presence of a **Ghost**, aligning with their ethereal nature of not leaving physical traces.

#### 3. Analyze Soil Samples
- **Soil Acidic**: Detecting acidic soil rules out the presence of an **Ogre**, often associated with environments where acidic soil is rare.
- **Soil Alkaline**: No creature is directly ruled out with alkaline soil presence.
- **Neutral Soil**: No creature is ruled out by neutral soil conditions.

#### 4. Detect Ethereal Frequencies
- **High Frequency**: Rules out the presence of an **Ogre**, as they don't typically resonate with high frequencies.
- **Low Frequency**: No creature is ruled out at a low frequency.
- **No Frequency**: No ruling out occurs here as the absence of frequency leaves all open.

#### 5. Examine Residual Footprints
- **Large Footprints**: No creatures are specifically ruled out when large footprints are found.
- **Small Footprints**: No creatures are excluded based on small footprints.
- **No Footprints**: Rules out the **Ghost**, matching with their inclination not to leave traces.

#### 6. Detect Aura Signatures
- **Positive Aura**: Rules out an **Ogre** which is known for their generally negative energy.
- **Negative Aura**: No creature is ruled out by a negative aura.
- **Neutral Aura**: Presence of a neutral aura leaves all options open for creature presence.
