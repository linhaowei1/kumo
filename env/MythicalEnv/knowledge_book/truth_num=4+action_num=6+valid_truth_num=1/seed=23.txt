## Magical Detection Methods and Lore Reference Checks

In the realm of mythical creature identification, specific detection methods and lore checks can help you exclude certain creatures, shedding light on the enigma of their presence.

### 1. Inspect Residual Enchantments
- **Enchantment Fading**: If enchantment residues are detected but are fading, *Dragons* are ruled out as this suggests their absence.
- **Enchantment Strong**: There are no specific creatures excluded with this outcome.
- **No Enchantment**: There are no creatures excluded with this outcome.

### 2. Analyze Bone Fragments
- **Ancient Bones**: The discovery of ancient bones rules out the presence of *Nymphs* and *Mermaids*.
- **Fresh Bones**: If fresh bone fragments are found, this rules out the presence of a *Lich*, indicating they are not a factor.
- **No Bones Found**: This outcome doesn't rule out any specific creatures.

### 3. Examine Water Clarity
- **Clarity Range (0.0, 0.5)**: Low water clarity in this range rules out *Dragons*.
- **Clarity Range (0.6, 1.0)**: Water clarity in this range eliminates the possibility of *Nymphs* and *Mermaids*.
- **Clarity Range (1.1, 5.0)**: This water clarity range doesn't rule out any creatures.

### 4. Check for Temporal Distortions
- **Time Anomalies Detected**: The presence of time anomalies rules out *Liches*.
- **No Anomalies**: No creatures are excluded with this outcome.

### 5. Look for Residual Heat
- **Heat Range (0, 25)**: If residual heat falls within this range, *Dragons* are ruled out due to the insufficiency of heat expected from these creatures.
- **Heat Range (26, 50)**: No creatures are excluded in this heat range.
- **Heat Range (51, 100)**: There are no exclusions within this heat range.

### 6. Analyze Vocal Echoes
- **High-Pitched Echoes**: The presence of high-pitched echoes allows you to rule out *Dragons*.
- **Low-Pitched Echoes** and **No Echoes**: These outcomes do not exclude any specific creatures.

By using these detection methods and carefully analyzing their outcomes, you can effectively narrow down the presence of certain mythical creatures. Each outcome helps in methodically excluding specific beings, guiding you towards unveiling the truth within various mythological contexts.
