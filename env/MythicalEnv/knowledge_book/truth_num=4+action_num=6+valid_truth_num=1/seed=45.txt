# Guidebook to Mythical Creatures and Magical Detection Methods

## Introduction
In this guidebook, we explore the mysterious world of mythical creatures, focusing on Zombies, Shades, Unicorns, and Manticores. Alongside these fascinating beings, we delve into the methods used to detect their presence, relying on lore references and magical analysis. Understanding how to correctly interpret the signs and nuances in the enchanted world can reveal which creatures are not present, thereby narrowing down the potential suspects in any mythical occurrence.

## Mythical Creatures

### Zombie
A reanimated corpse brought back to life through mystical means, Zombies are often depicted as mindless beings that wander aimlessly. While this guide does not focus on their detection specifically, recognizing signs where a Zombie might have been is part of the greater investigation.

### Shade
Enigmatic and elusive, Shades are incorporeal entities often associated with darkness or shadow. They are usually characterized by their ability to move silently and remain unseen, existing more like echoes of souls rather than physical beings.

### Unicorn
The Unicorn is a majestic, horse-like creature with a single spiraling horn on its forehead. Known for its purity and connection to magical energies, the Unicorn often leaves traces of its presence that can be distinguished from other creatures by the absence of certain physical markers.

### Manticore
A fearsome creature with the body of a lion, the tail of a scorpion, and the face of a human, Manticores are often formidable and dangerous. Their physical presence is noted through specific kinds of evidence that can differentiate them from other creatures.

## Magical Detection Methods

### Analyze Claw Marks
This method involves examining any claw marks left behind. The nature of the claw marks can help rule out certain creatures:
- **Deep Gouges**: No creatures are specifically ruled out.
- **Fine Scratches**: When observed, Manticores are ruled out.
- **No Claw Marks**: Indicates that Unicorns are not present.

### Examine Residual Footprints
By studying footprints left at the scene, we gain insights into the creatures involved:
- **Large Footprints**: No creatures are specifically ruled out.
- **Small Footprints**: No creatures are specifically ruled out.
- **No Footprints**: When no footprints are found, Shades are not present, as they leave no physical traces.

### Detect Ethereal Frequencies
This technique involves sensing the ethereal or magical vibrations left by a creature:
- **High Frequency**: No creatures are specifically ruled out.
- **Low Frequency**: Suggests that Unicorns are not present.
- **No Frequency**: No implications of exclusion.

### Detect Magical Residue
After a creature's passage, it often leaves behind trace amounts of magical energy:
- **Fire Essence**: Points to Unicorns not being involved.
- **Shadow Essence**: No creatures are specifically ruled out.
- **No Residue Detected**: Offers no exclusions.

### Detect Shadow Movement
Observing shadow behavior can hint at certain creaturesâ€™ activities:
- **Shadows Active**: Unicorns are ruled out, as they do not manipulate shadows.
- **Shadows Inactive**: Offers no specific exclusions.
- **No Shadows**: Indicates that Shades are not present as they thrive in shadowy environments.

### Inspect Footprints
Investigating the type of footprints can determine the absence of certain creatures:
- **Hoof Prints**: No creatures are specifically ruled out.
- **Clawed Prints**: Indicates that Unicorns are not present.
- **No Footprints**: Shades are ruled out due to the lack of physical traces.

## Conclusion
By systematically examining the signs left behind using the methods outlined, it is possible to discern which mythical creatures are not responsible for the observed phenomena. This careful process of elimination aids in the effective investigation and understanding of the magical world.
