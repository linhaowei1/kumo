# Guidebook to Mythical Creatures and Magical Detection Methods

Welcome to a world where mythical creatures roam the realm, hidden from ordinary sight. This guidebook will introduce you to four unique mythical creatures: the Salamander, Banshee, Pegasus, and Werewolf. Additionally, we will explore various magical detection methods or lore checks to help identify or rule out these creatures based on specific observations. The art of exclusion is a key component in understanding these magical beings, as it allows us to narrow down possibilities by ruling out which creatures are not responsible for certain phenomena.

## Mythical Creatures

### 1. Salamander
The Salamander is a mythical creature associated with fire and heat. Often depicted as a flame-kissed lizard, these beings supposedly thrive in intense temperatures and can survive in flames unharmed.

### 2. Banshee
A Banshee is a spectral entity associated with foreboding wails and omen of death. Known in folklore to announce impending doom with her haunting cries, the Banshee is typically ethereal and ghost-like.

### 3. Pegasus
Pegasus, the majestic flying horse, is a symbol of grace and power. Known for its ability to soar through the skies, Pegasus is a creature of light and beauty, often celebrated in ancient myths and iconography.

### 4. Werewolf
The Werewolf is a creature of the night, a human cursed to transform into a wolf, often during a full moon. With an affinity for the nocturnal and a reputation for ferocity, werewolves embody primal instincts and strength.

## Magical Detection Methods

### Detection Method 1: Test for Elemental Balance
- **Outcome Rulings**:
  - **(0, 30)**: Rule out the presence of Salamander.
  - **(31, 70) and (71, 100)**: No creatures ruled out.

This method involves testing the elemental harmony in an area, which may be disturbed by the presence of certain creatures.

### Detection Method 2: Observe Light Refractions
- **Outcome Rulings**:
  - **Prismatic Light**: Rule out the presence of Pegasus.
  - **No Refraction**: No creatures ruled out.

This method focuses on observing how light scatters or refracts in the presence of these beings.

### Detection Method 3: Analyze Bone Fragments
- **Outcome Rulings**:
  - **Ancient Bones**: No creatures ruled out.
  - **Fresh Bones**: Rule out the presence of Werewolf.
  - **No Bones Found**: No creatures ruled out.

Analyzing bone fragments can provide clues about recent or old activities of certain creatures, particularly those tied to the corporeal realm.

### Detection Method 4: Examine Water Clarity
- **Outcome Rulings**:
  - **(0.0, 0.5)**: Rule out the presence of Salamander.
  - **(0.6, 1.0) and (1.1, 5.0)**: No creatures ruled out.

The clarity of water can be indicative of influence by magical creatures, especially those with purifying or contaminating abilities.

### Detection Method 5: Check for Temporal Distortions
- **Outcome Rulings**:
  - **Time Anomalies Detected**: Rule out the presence of Werewolf.
  - **No Anomalies**: No creatures ruled out.

Temporal distortions signify disruptions in time, often linked to creatures with temporal influences or effects.

### Detection Method 6: Analyze Scale Samples
- **Outcome Rulings**:
  - **Hard Scales and Soft Scales**: No creatures ruled out.
  - **No Scales**: Rule out the presence of Pegasus and Banshee.

Studying scale samples can provide insights, particularly since not all mythical creatures possess them.

## Conclusion

Armed with this guidebook, you are now ready to navigate the mysterious world of mythical creatures and use magical detection methods effectively. By ruling out creatures based on these observations, you will be able to narrow down possibilities and potentially identify the presence of these enchanting beings. Happy exploring!
