# Spice Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook delves into the intriguing world of spices, specifically focusing on Nigella Seeds, Mustard Seeds, Rosemary, and Onion Powder. We'll explore various sensory analysis experiments to observe their characteristics. Through these experiments, you'll learn how to analyze each spice by observing unique traits and ruling out possibilities rather than zeroing in on confirmations.

## Spices Overview
- **Nigella Seeds**: Also known as black cumin, these seeds are small, matte black, and uniquely flavored.
- **Mustard Seeds**: These tiny seeds can vary in color from yellow to brown and are known for their sharp and pungent flavors.

- **Black**: If detected, rule out Nigella Seeds.
- **Other**: No spices are ruled out.

### Texture Analysis
Feel and texture help in identifying the type of spice by ruling out those with different textural attributes.

- **Powdery**: If detected, rule out Onion Powder.
- **Coarse**: If detected, rule out Mustard Seeds and Nigella Seeds.
- **Smooth**: No spices are ruled out.
- **Grainy**: No spices are ruled out.

- **Sweet**: No spices are ruled out.
- **Salty**: No spices are ruled out.
- **Sour**: No spices are ruled out.
- **Bitter**: If detected, rule out Mustard Seeds.
- **Umami**: No spices are ruled out.

### Heat Level Measurement
This examines the heat or pungency level of the spice, often felt as a kind of "kick."

- **Heat Level (0-1000 Scoville Units)**: No spices are ruled out.
- **Heat Level (1001-10000 Scoville Units)**: No spices are ruled out.
- **Heat Level (10001-50000 Scoville Units)**: No spices are ruled out.
- **Heat Level (50001-1000000 Scoville Units)**: If detected, rule out Mustard Seeds and Onion Powder.

## Conclusion
