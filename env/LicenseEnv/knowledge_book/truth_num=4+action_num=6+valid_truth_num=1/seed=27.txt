# Software Licensing Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to provide an introductory overview of several common software licenses and methods to analyze them for specific legal and usage rights considerations. Understanding these licenses and how they interact with different analysis methods can assist developers, legal professionals, and businesses in making informed decisions about software use, distribution, and development.

## Software Licenses Overview

Below are the software licenses covered in this guide:

1. **Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND)**
   - Allows distribution and copying of the work as long as it remains unchanged and credited.
   - Does not permit modifications or derivative works.
   - Allows usage but conducting some evaluations will dismiss this license based on specific outcomes.

2. **GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3**
   - A strong copyleft license with network use clause requiring source code disclosure.
   - Allows commercial use but with restrictions on ownership and distribution.
   - Essential for platforms engaging users over a network to share the source.

3. **Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)**
   - A permissive license allowing modified versions to be distributed under different terms.
   - Includes a patent grant, providing users some measure of protection regarding patent claims.
   - Evaluations involving commercial and copyleft assessments will not rule this out.

4. **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND)**
   - Restrictive license; does not allow commercial use nor modifications.
   - Suitable for content intended to remain unaltered and non-commercial.

## Analysis Methods and Outcomes

Certain methods are employed to analyze various aspects of these licenses. Below are the descriptions of these methods along with their outcomes:

### 1. Commercial Use Assessment
This analysis determines whether a license permits or restricts the use of software commercially.

- **Permits Commercial Use:** This outcome rules out 'Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND)', which explicitly restricts commercial activities.
- **Restricts Commercial Use:** This outcome rules out 'GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3', indicating that it poses some conditions meaningful to commercial applications.

### 2. Copyleft Clause Examination
Evaluates the strength of copyleft provisions, requiring derived works to retain the same license.

- **Strong Copyleft:** This outcome implies that licenses with strong copyleft forces cannot be ruled out but indicates GNU licenses traditionally feature them.
- **Weak Copyleft:** Rules out 'GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3', indicating its more restrictive nature.
- **No Copyleft:** No specific license is ruled out, highlighting completely permissive licenses are not strongly featured.

### 3. Modification Rights Analysis
Looks at whether a license allows for source code modification and distribution of derivative works.

- **Modification Allowed:** Rules out 'Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND)', which prohibits alterations.
- **Modification Not Allowed:** No specific outcomes present to rule out licenses, since the examples here mostly permit modifications or have other restrictive mechanisms.

### 4. Usage Rights Evaluation
Assesses the ability to use and execute the software as intended without restriction.

- **Usage Allowed:** This outcome rules out 'GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3' and 'Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND)', which impose restrictions on usage rights.
- **Usage Restricted:** Does not apply here due to the lack of examples explicitly restricting usage devoid of other clauses.

### 5. Network Use Clause Evaluation
Assesses whether sharing over a network (e.g., SaaS) requires making the source available.

- **Requires Source Disclosure over Network:** Exclusively rules out 'GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3', asserting that distribution on a network necessitates source disclosure.
- **No Network Source Disclosure Requirement:** Licenses with this property cannot be ruled out given the absence from other licenses.

### 6. Patent Clause Evaluation
Examines whether the license includes patent rights or protections provided by the licensor to the licensee.

- **Includes Patent Grant:** Rules out 'Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)', as including patent rights could necessitate carefully crafted legal frameworks.
- **No Patent Clause:** No rules laid down due to the general presence or absence of patents which does not specifically hallmark other licenses explicitly here.

## Conclusion

The correct application of these analysis methods ensures comprehensive insight into software license implications, perfectly catering to use-case scenarios. By recognizing which licenses are ruled out under specific outcomes, developers and legal professionals can navigate compliance and strategically choose or avoid particular licenses for their projects.
