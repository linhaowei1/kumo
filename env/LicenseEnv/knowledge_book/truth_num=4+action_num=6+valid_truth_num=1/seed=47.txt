# Software Licensing Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to help you understand and analyze different software licenses by providing insights into various aspects of each license. We will explore four popular software licenses and the analysis methods used to evaluate them. The goal is to identify constraints and opportunities associated with each license by examining different analysis criteria. The core aspect of this guidebook is to highlight which licenses must be excluded based on specific outcomes from analysis methods.

## Software Licenses

1. **Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)**
   - This license allows users to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, as long as the original creator is credited.
   
2. **GNU General Public License (GPL) v3**
   - A strong copyleft license that allows users the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the software, requiring derived works to be distributed under the same license.

3. **Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)**
   - A permissive license that allows redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, under certain conditions. It includes a patent grant from contributors to users.

4. **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)**
   - Similar to CC BY, but users must share adaptations under the same license terms as the original.

## Analysis Methods

1. **Commercial Use Assessment**
   - This method evaluates if a license permits or restricts commercial use of the software.

   - **Outcome: Permits Commercial Use** excludes: None
   - **Outcome: Restricts Commercial Use** excludes: 
     - Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)
     - GNU General Public License (GPL) v3

2. **Patent Clause Evaluation**
   - This analysis determines whether a license includes a patent grant to end users.

   - **Outcome: Includes Patent Grant** excludes: 
     - Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)
   - **Outcome: No Patent Clause** excludes: None

3. **Copyleft Clause Examination**
   - Analyzes the presence and strength of copyleft provisions in a license.

   - **Outcome: Strong Copyleft** excludes: 
     - GNU General Public License (GPL) v3
   - **Outcome: Weak Copyleft** excludes: None
   - **Outcome: No Copyleft** excludes: 
     - Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)

4. **Modification Rights Analysis**
   - This evaluation looks at whether modifications of the software are permitted under the license.

   - **Outcome: Modification Allowed** excludes: None
   - **Outcome: Modification Not Allowed** excludes: 
     - GNU General Public License (GPL) v3

5. **Anti-DRM Clause Identification**
   - This method checks if a license includes clauses against Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies.

   - **Outcome: Includes Anti-DRM Clause** excludes:
     - Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)
     - GNU General Public License (GPL) v3
   - **Outcome: No Anti-DRM Clause** excludes: None

6. **Private Use Permissions Check**
   - Examines whether the license imposes any constraints on private use of the software.

   - **Outcome: State A** excludes: None
   - **Outcome: State B** excludes: None

## Conclusion

This guidebook presents a structured approach to analyze software licenses based on six key methods. Each method provides specific outcomes, and understanding these outcomes is crucial for determining which licenses to consider or rule out in a given context. By applying these methods, you can make informed decisions about the suitability of each license for your software project needs. Remember, the exclusion lists indicate which licenses are not viable based on the observed conditions from the analysis.
