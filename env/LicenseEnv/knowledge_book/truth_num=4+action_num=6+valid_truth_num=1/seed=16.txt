# Software Licensing Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook serves as an introduction to understanding various software licenses and using specific analysis methods to evaluate them. This guide will discuss four specific licenses, explain distinct analytical methods relevant to these licenses, and provide outcomes that help determine which licenses can be ruled out when certain states are observed.

## Software Licenses Overview

### 1. Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)
This license allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon a work non-commercially, as long as they credit the creator and license their new creations under identical terms.

### 2. CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)
CC0 (No Rights Reserved) enables creators to place their works in the public domain, which means anyone can use, modify, and distribute the work without requiring permission or citing the author.

### 3. GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v2.1
The LGPL allows developers and companies to use and integrate their software into their own (even proprietary) software under specific conditions that require derivatives or modifications to also be open-source under the same license.

### 4. Eclipse Public License 2.0
This license is intended for open-source software projects, which allows for the software to be used in commercial applications, provided that modifications to the software are shared back with the community.

## Analysis Methods

### 1. Commercial Use Assessment
This method evaluates whether a software license permits commercial activities. 
- **Outcome**: 
  - When observing a state of **Permits Commercial Use**, exclude "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)".
  - When observing **Restricts Commercial Use**, exclude "Eclipse Public License 2.0", "GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v2.1", and "CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)". 

### 2. Copyleft Clause Examination
This examines how the license handles copyleft clauses, which may require derivative works to follow the same licensing terms.
- **Outcome**:
  - When observing a state of **Weak Copyleft**, exclude "CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)".
  - There are no exclusions for **Strong Copyleft** or **No Copyleft** states since no licenses fall under these outcomes.

### 3. Sublicensing Permissions Evaluation
This method checks if a license permits sublicensing, meaning allowing others to further license the work.
- **Outcome**:
  - When observing a state of **Sublicensing Prohibited**, exclude "GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v2.1".
  - There are no licenses to rule out under **Sublicensing Allowed**.

### 4. Attribution Requirement Check
This involves checking whether a license has requirements for giving credit to the original creator.
- **Outcome**:
  - When observing a state of **Attribution Required**, exclude "CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)".
  - No licenses are excluded for **No Attribution Required** due to the current licensing scenarios.

### 5. Modification Rights Analysis
This checks whether a license provides rights to modify the software.
- **Outcome**:
  - This analysis does not result in any licenses being ruled out.

### 6. Indemnity Clause Review
This method looks at indemnity clauses that might protect the licensee against legal claims.
- **Outcome**:
  - This analysis does not result in any licenses being ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guide has outlined the key software licenses and the analytical methods used to evaluate them. By understanding these licenses through various analysis methods, it becomes possible to identify restrictions, permissions, and other regulatory clauses involved in software licensing. When conducting an analysis, use observed states to rule out specific licenses according to the provided outcomes, ensuring accurate evaluation of software licensing conditions.
