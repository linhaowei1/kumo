## Software Licensing Analysis Guidebook

Understanding different software licenses is crucial for developers, businesses, and open-source advocates to ensure legal compliance and to adopt the appropriate license for their projects. This guidebook introduces several software licenses and provides an analysis framework using specific analysis methods. By examining various clauses and requirements, the guidebook aims to clarify the conditions under which each software license can be excluded or ruled out as an option for your project.

## Software Licenses Overview

1. **GNU General Public License (GPL) v2**: A widely used free software license that ensures end users retain the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the software. It is known for its strong copyleft requirements, which mandate that derivative works are distributed under the same license terms.

2. **Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)**: This license allows users to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material, even commercially, as long as they provide proper attribution to the original creation.

3. **The Unlicense**: A license dedicated to releasing software into the public domain, it offers a way to relinquish copyright control, providing recipients with freedom of use without restriction.

4. **WTFPL (Do What The F*ck You Want To Public License)**: A permissive license that allows users to do nearly anything they want with the software, including personal and commercial activities.

## Analysis Methods

To accurately assess and determine the applicability of each software license, each must be evaluated against several licensing parameters, or analysis methods:
    
### 1. Copyleft Clause Examination

- **Assessment Objective**: Determine if a license enforces copyleft terms, which require derivative works to be licensed under the same terms.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Strong Copyleft**: 
  - **Weak Copyleft**:
  - **No Copyleft**: Rule out the use of the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 as it enforces strong copyleft, so if derivative flexibility is required, GPL v2 is not suitable.
    
### 2. Attribution Requirement Check

- **Assessment Objective**: Identify if a license requires users to give proper credit to the original authors.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Attribution Required**: Rule out licenses that do **not** require attribution; the licenses that do not require attribution include WTFPL and The Unlicense.
  - **No Attribution Required**: 
    
### 3. Commercial Use Assessment

- **Assessment Objective**: Evaluate if a license allows for the commercial use of the software.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Permits Commercial Use**:
  - **Restricts Commercial Use**: Rule out the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 and Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) for projects where restriction against commercial use is needed.
    
### 4. Sublicensing Permissions Evaluation

- **Assessment Objective**: Determine if a license permits sublicensing, allowing the licensee to grant sublicenses to others.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Sublicensing Allowed**:
  - **Sublicensing Prohibited**: Rule out the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2, which prohibits sublicensing, making it unsuitable if sublicensing is desired.
    
### 5. Patent Clause Evaluation

- **Assessment Objective**: Assess if the license includes a patent grant, providing rights over any patents related to the software.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Includes Patent Grant**:
  - **No Patent Clause**: Rule out The Unlicense, as it does not include a patent clause, which may be critical if patent rights are a concern.
    
### 6. Usage Rights Evaluation

- **Assessment Objective**: Analyze the extent to which the software can be used without restrictions.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Usage Allowed**:
  - **Usage Restricted**: Rule out the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 if unrestricted usage is a requirement, as it imposes certain limitations.
    
## Conclusion

By applying these analysis methods, users can identify which software licenses should be ruled out based on specific needs and constraints dictated by the licensing parameters. Understanding these evaluations will help ensure legal compliance and align license selection with project goals and values.
