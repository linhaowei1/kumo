# Software Licensing Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

Understanding software licenses is crucial for software developers, legal professionals, and companies that engage with open-source and proprietary software. This guidebook introduces four specific software licenses and six analysis methods to evaluate different aspects of these licenses. The guide offers insights into how to determine which licenses can be ruled out based on observed states during analysis. Our objective is to enable readers to discern which software licenses are applicable and which are to be excluded based on specific outcomes of an analysis.

## Software Licenses Overview

1. **No License (All Rights Reserved)**
   - This indicates that all rights are reserved by the creator. Without an explicit license, users have minimal rights, often requiring explicit permission to use, modify, or distribute the software.

2. **Eclipse Public License 2.0**
   - This is an open-source license that supports collaborative software development. It allows for the modification and distribution of software, provided that derivative works are also shared under the same license.

3. **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC)**
   - This license allows users to modify and build upon the work non-commercially, and although new works must acknowledge the original creator and be non-commercial, they do not have to follow the same license terms.

4. **Mozilla Public License 2.0**
   - This is a weak copyleft license that allows code to be mixed with proprietary code. It requires that modifications to MPL-licensed code be made available under the same license when distributed.

## Analysis Methods

### 1. Commercial Use Assessment
This method evaluates whether a license permits the software to be used for commercial purposes.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Permits Commercial Use**: Rules out 'Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC)' and 'No License (All Rights Reserved)'.
  - **Restricts Commercial Use**: Rules out 'Mozilla Public License 2.0' and 'Eclipse Public License 2.0'.

### 2. Modification Rights Analysis
This approach determines if a license permits modifications to the software.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Modification Allowed**: Rules out 'No License (All Rights Reserved)'.
  - **Modification Not Allowed**: Rules out 'Mozilla Public License 2.0'.

### 3. Copyleft Clause Examination
Copyleft is a general method for making a program free and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Strong Copyleft**: No licenses are ruled out.
  - **Weak Copyleft**: No licenses are ruled out.
  - **No Copyleft**: Rules out 'Mozilla Public License 2.0'.

### 4. Patent Retaliation Clause Examination
Analyzes whether a license includes a clause that allows the termination of rights if patent litigation is initiated.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **(0, 0)**: No licenses are ruled out.
  - **(1, 100)**: Rules out 'Mozilla Public License 2.0'.

### 5. Patent Clause Evaluation
Assesses whether a license includes provisions regarding patent rights.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Includes Patent Grant**: Rules out 'Mozilla Public License 2.0'.
  - **No Patent Clause**: No licenses are ruled out.

### 6. Defensive Termination Clause Review
Examines if the license has provisions for defensive termination to protect against conflicting claims.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **State A**: No licenses are ruled out.
  - **State B**: No licenses are ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides a foundation for understanding the relationships between various software licenses and the analysis methods used to evaluate them. By following the rule-out approach stipulated here, users can exclude certain licenses based on the outcomes observed in their analysis. This exclusion process allows for a systematic and clearer understanding of which licenses can apply under specific circumstances, ensuring better compliance and alignment with licensing requirements.
