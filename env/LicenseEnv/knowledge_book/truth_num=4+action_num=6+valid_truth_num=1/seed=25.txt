## **Software Licensing Analysis Guidebook**

Understanding software licenses and their implications is crucial in the software development and distribution process. This guide introduces you to four common software licenses and several methods to analyze them. By following this guide, you will learn how to evaluate and rule out certain licenses based on specific analysis outcomes, ultimately aiding in the selection of the most appropriate license for your needs.

## Software Licenses Overview

1. **GNU General Public License (GPL) v2**: A widely used free software license, which ensures that end users have the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software.

2. **Apache License 2.0**: A permissive license that allows users to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of the software under the terms of the license.

3. **WTFPL (Do What The F*ck You Want To Public License)**: A permissive license that is one of the most permissive and free licenses available. It allows any action with the software without any restrictions.

4. **Eclipse Public License 2.0**: A free and open-source software license, which is a more business-friendly alternative to the GPL.

## Analysis Methods

To determine the appropriateness of a software license, various aspects must be analyzed. Below are methods to analyze specific license characteristics:

### 1. Attribution Requirement Check
This analysis determines whether a license requires crediting the original authors.

- **Attribution Required**: If a license requires attribution, licenses under this category must be included, and others should be excluded. Here, the "WTFPL" is an example where attribution is required, and hence, other licenses that do not require attribution should be excluded if attribution is necessary.

- **No Attribution Required**: On encountering licenses stating no attribution is needed, any license that does require attribution should be ruled out. For example, "Apache License 2.0" implies no attribution requirement, so exclude licenses that require attribution.

### 2. Usage Rights Evaluation
This evaluation checks whether software can be used freely under each license.

- **Usage Allowed**: If a license allows unrestricted use, those that restrict it should be excluded. However, here all listed licenses restrict usage to some extent.

- **Usage Restricted**: When restricted usage terms are analyzed, licenses like "GNU GPL v2" and "Apache License 2.0" are ruled out due to usage restrictions.

### 3. Sublicensing Permissions Evaluation
This examines if sublicensing is permissible under the licenses.

- **Sublicensing Allowed**: Licenses allowing sublicensing can exclude those that disallow it. Up to date, no licenses strictly allow sublicensing without restrictions in this guide.

- **Sublicensing Prohibited**: In this context, "GNU GPL v2" prohibits sublicensing, therefore it must be ruled out when sublicensing is considered.

### 4. Commercial Use Assessment
This identifies if commercial use of software is allowed under the license.

- **Permits Commercial Use**: Any licenses that do permit commercial use would exclude those that have restrictions. Presently, no licenses are noted to unconditionally permit commercial use.

- **Restricts Commercial Use**: When restrictions on commercial use are found, licenses such as "GNU GPL v2", "Eclipse Public License 2.0", and "Apache License 2.0" are excluded as they restrict commercial use.

### 5. Copyleft Clause Examination
This analysis reviews how a license enforces copyleft principles, which ensure derivative works remain open-source.

- **Strong Copyleft**: Strong copyleft requires derivative works to use the same license. If observed, licenses without such stipulations (e.g., "Apache License 2.0" noted) should be ruled out.

- **Weak Copyleft/No Copyleft**: In the presence of weak or no copyleft (e.g., "GNU GPL v2" claimed to have no copyleft), licenses specifying copyleft enforcement are excluded.

### 6. Patent Retaliation Clause Examination
This checks whether a license involves a patent retaliation clause, which prohibits patent litigation against contributors.

- **Patent Retaliation Clause Present**: Identifies licenses like "Apache License 2.0", which includes patent retaliation coverage, ruling out licenses that do not have this clause.

- **No Patent Retaliation Clause**: If absent, it rules out licenses like "Apache License 2.0," which possess this clause.

## Conclusion

This guide is designed to help you familiarize yourself with these common licenses and analytical methods to assess their terms. Through this structured approach, you can effectively rule out licenses based on specific conditions encountered in your software development and distribution processes. Remember, the goal is to identify a license that aligns with your project needs while meeting all legal requirements.
