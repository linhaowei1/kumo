# Software Licensing Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of different software licenses and the methods used to analyze them. It focuses on the following licenses: 'CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)', 'Apache License 2.0', 'No License (All Rights Reserved)', and 'MIT License'. Additionally, it outlines six analysis methods to assess these licenses: 'Commercial Use Assessment', 'Usage Rights Evaluation', 'Attribution Requirement Check', 'Copyleft Clause Examination', 'Sublicensing Permissions Evaluation', and 'Anti-DRM Clause Identification'. This guidebook is designed to help you understand how to exclude licenses based on specific conditions or outcomes.

## Overview of Software Licenses

1. **CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)**
   - This license is akin to placing work in the public domain, waiving all copyrights and related rights to the fullest extent allowed by law.
   
2. **Apache License 2.0**
   - A permissive open-source license that allows wide use of the software, including the rights to modify and distribute, often with unique requirements, such as maintaining a NOTICE file.
   
3. **No License (All Rights Reserved)**
   - Indicates that the copyright holder retains all rights.
   - No permissions are expressly granted, implying that usage is restricted without explicit permission.
   
4. **MIT License**
   - A permissive license that allows nearly unrestricted freedom, as long as the original license and copyright notice are included in the derived work.

## Analysis Methods

1. **Commercial Use Assessment**
   - This analysis determines whether a license permits or restricts commercial use.
   - Outcome Analysis:
     - **Restricts Commercial Use**: Rule out 'No License (All Rights Reserved)'.
     - **Permits Commercial Use**: Rule out 'CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)', 'Apache License 2.0', 'MIT License'.

2. **Usage Rights Evaluation**
   - This method evaluates whether usage is allowed or restricted.
   - Outcome Analysis:
     - **Usage Restricted**: Rule out licenses not in {'Apache License 2.0', 'MIT License'}.
     - **Usage Allowed**: No licenses are ruled out, as this set is empty.

3. **Attribution Requirement Check**
   - Checks if a license requires attribution when the software is used or distributed.
   - Outcome Analysis:
     - **Attribution Required**: Rule out 'Apache License 2.0', 'MIT License', 'No License (All Rights Reserved)'.
     - **No Attribution Required**: Rule out 'CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)', 'No License (All Rights Reserved)'.

4. **Copyleft Clause Examination**
   - Analyzes the presence of copyleft provisions, determining if derived work must be shared under similar terms.
   - Outcome Analysis:
     - **Strong Copyleft**: Rule out 'CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)'.
     - **Weak Copyleft**: Rule out 'No License (All Rights Reserved)'.
     - **No Copyleft**: Rule out 'Apache License 2.0', 'MIT License', 'CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)'.

5. **Sublicensing Permissions Evaluation**
   - Assesses whether sublicensing is allowed under the license.
   - Outcome Analysis:
     - **Sublicensing Allowed**: Rule out 'CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)', 'Apache License 2.0', 'No License (All Rights Reserved)'.
     - **Sublicensing Prohibited**: Rule out 'MIT License', 'CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)', 'Apache License 2.0', 'No License (All Rights Reserved)'.

6. **Anti-DRM Clause Identification**
   - Identifies if there are provisions against Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies.
   - Outcome Analysis:
     - **Includes Anti-DRM Clause**: Rule out 'MIT License', 'CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)', 'Apache License 2.0', 'No License (All Rights Reserved)'.
     - **No Anti-DRM Clause**: Rule out licenses not in {'MIT License'}.

## Conclusion

This guidebook presents a method of analyzing licenses through the lens of ruling out possibilities based on observed conditions. By applying these methods, you'll be able to navigate the nuances of software licenses effectively, ensuring compliance and proper usage as per the defined rights and obligations.
