# Software Licensing Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

Understanding software licenses is a critical aspect of managing and deploying software, as these licenses dictate how software can be used, modified, and distributed. This guidebook introduces key software licenses and the methods used to analyze them. Through comprehensive examination, you can determine which licenses are applicable or must be ruled out based on specific clauses and requirements.

### Software Licenses Covered

1. **Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)**
2. **Eclipse Public License 2.0**
3. **The Unlicense**
4. **ISC License**

### Analysis Methods

To effectively analyze the software licenses, we employ six methods:

1. **Copyleft Clause Examination**
2. **Patent Clause Evaluation**
3. **Attribution Requirement Check**
4. **Commercial Use Assessment**
5. **Modification Rights Analysis**
6. **Integration with Proprietary Software Assessment**

## Analysis Methods Overview and Outcomes

Below, we delve into each analysis method, explaining the possible outcomes and which licenses must be ruled out based on these outcomes.

### 1. Copyleft Clause Examination

This analysis investigates the nature of copyleft clauses, which require derivative works to also be open source under the same license.

- **Strong Copyleft:**
  - Rule Out: **ISC License**

- **Weak Copyleft:**
  - Rule Out: None

- **No Copyleft:**
  - Rule Out: None

### 2. Patent Clause Evaluation

This method evaluates if the license includes clauses related to patents.

- **Includes Patent Grant:**
  - Rule Out: **Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)**

- **No Patent Clause:**
  - Rule Out: **The Unlicense**

### 3. Attribution Requirement Check

This check determines whether the license requires attribution when the software is used or distributed.

- **Attribution Required:**
  - Rule Out: **The Unlicense**

- **No Attribution Required:**
  - Rule Out: None

### 4. Commercial Use Assessment

This assessment evaluates whether the license allows the software to be used for commercial purposes.

- **Permits Commercial Use:**
  - Rule Out: None

- **Restricts Commercial Use:**
  - Rule Out: **Eclipse Public License 2.0**, **ISC License**

### 5. Modification Rights Analysis

This analysis identifies whether the software can be modified by the user.

- **Modification Allowed:**
  - Rule Out: None

- **Modification Not Allowed:**
  - Rule Out: **ISC License**

### 6. Integration with Proprietary Software Assessment

This assessment checks the compatibility of the software license with proprietary software.

- **State A:**
  - Rule Out: None

- **State B:**
  - Rule Out: None

## Conclusion

By applying these analysis methods, you can systematically determine which licenses do not meet your requirements based on specific outcomes. This process ensures clarity and aids in decision-making regarding software utilization and distribution.

Remember, each outcome provides insight into which licenses are not applicable under the conditions specified, making your software licensing decisions more deliberate and informed.
