# Software Licensing Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a clear overview of various software licenses and analysis methods. By understanding these licenses and employing specific analysis methods, you can make informed decisions regarding software distribution, modification, and commercial use.

## Software Licenses Overview

1. **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC)**:
   - Allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as they credit you.

2. **Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)**:
   - Permits users to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the work, even commercially, as long as they credit the creator for the original creation.

3. **Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND)**:
   - Allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to the creator.

4. **Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)**:
   - Allows the distribution of your work and derivatives under the same license. Offers a patent grant but does not guarantee non-infringement of patents.

## Analysis Methods

### 1. Commercial Use Assessment
This analysis determines whether a software license allows or restricts commercial use.

- **Outcome: Permits Commercial Use**
  - Rule out: **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC)**
  
- **Outcome: Restricts Commercial Use**
  - Rule out: **Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)**

### 2. Modification Rights Analysis
This method evaluates the allowance for making modifications to the original software.

- **Outcome: Modification Allowed**
  - Rule out: **Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND)**

- **Outcome: Modification Not Allowed**
  - No licenses need to be ruled out explicitly.

### 3. Patent Clause Evaluation
Examines the license for clauses related to patent grants.

- **Outcome: Includes Patent Grant**
  - Rule out: **Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)**

- **Outcome: No Patent Clause**
  - No licenses need to be ruled out explicitly.

### 4. Usage Rights Evaluation
Focuses on determining whether a license restricts or allows the usage of software.

- **Outcome: Usage Allowed**
  - Rule out: **Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND)**
  
- **Outcome: Usage Restricted**
  - No licenses need to be ruled out explicitly.

### 5. Trademark Grant Check
Analyzes licenses for rights related to trademarks.

- **Outcome: State A**
  - No licenses need to be ruled out explicitly.
  
- **Outcome: State B**
  - No licenses need to be ruled out explicitly.

### 6. Redistribution in Binary Form Evaluation
Evaluates if a license permits redistribution of software in binary form.

- **Outcome: State A**
  - No licenses need to be ruled out explicitly.
  
- **Outcome: State B**
  - No licenses need to be ruled out explicitly.

## Conclusion

By conducting these analysis methods, users can identify which licenses should be ruled out based on specific outcomes. This exclusion approach aids in narrowing down the most suitable licenses for different purposes, ensuring that chosen licenses align with intended use-cases and legal requirements.
