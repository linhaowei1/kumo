# Software Licensing Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of selected software licenses and detailed methodologies for analyzing them. The focus is on understanding how specific outcomes of analysis methods can rule out certain licensing possibilities. 

## Software Licenses Overview

### 1. BSD 3-Clause License
The BSD 3-Clause License is a permissive free software license that allows software to be freely used, modified, and distributed. Key terms include minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software.

### 2. Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)
This license allows for sharing and adaptation of the licensed work, as long as it is attributed to the original creator and distributed under the same, similar, or a compatible license.

### 3. Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND)
This license allows others to download the works and share them with others as long as they credit the creator, but they canâ€™t change them in any way or use them commercially.

### 4. MIT License
The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is a simple and easy-to-understand license that allows users considerable freedom.

## Analysis Methods and Licensing Rule-Outs

Each analysis method assesses specific clauses and terms within the licenses. Observed outcomes can help rule out certain licenses.

### 1. Commercial Use Assessment
- **Permits Commercial Use**: Ruling out occurs for "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND)" as it restricts commercial use.
- **Restricts Commercial Use**: Rule out "BSD 3-Clause License" and "MIT License" as these permit commercial use.

### 2. Anti-DRM Clause Identification
- **Includes Anti-DRM Clause**: Rule out "Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)" as it includes an Anti-DRM clause.
- **No Anti-DRM Clause**: Rule out "BSD 3-Clause License" and "MIT License" as they do not contain an Anti-DRM clause.

### 3. Network Use Clause Evaluation
- **Requires Source Disclosure over Network**: No licenses can be ruled out as none require network source disclosure.
- **No Network Source Disclosure Requirement**: Rule out "BSD 3-Clause License" and "MIT License" as these do not have a network disclosure requirement.

### 4. Patent Retaliation Clause Examination
- **Presence of Patent Retaliation Clause**: Rule out outcome is aligned based on numeric values (0, 0) for "BSD 3-Clause License" and "MIT License", indicating no patent retaliation clause.
- **Absence of Patent Retaliation Clause**: No licenses in the data require ruling out based on this evaluation.

### 5. Modification Rights Analysis
- **Modification Allowed**: No specific licenses are ruled out.
- **Modification Not Allowed**: Rule out "MIT License" as modification is allowed, thus not fitting this outcome.

### 6. Sublicensing Permissions Evaluation
- **Sublicensing Allowed**: Rule out "BSD 3-Clause License" and "MIT License" as they allow sublicensing.
- **Sublicensing Prohibited**: No licenses in this analysis require ruling out.

## Conclusion

This guide details how specific licensing outcomes are used to rule out incompatible licenses based on the presence or absence of certain terms and clauses. By cross-referencing the outcomes, one can effectively determine which software licenses are not applicable for certain uses and requirements. This exclusion-based approach provides a systematic means of narrowing down license options, aiding developers and organizations in making informed licensing decisions.
