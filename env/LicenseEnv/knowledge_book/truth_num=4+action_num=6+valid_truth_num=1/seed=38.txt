# Software Licensing Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is intended to help you navigate the complexities of software licenses and perform an analysis on them using specific methods. We will discuss four commonly used software licenses and six analysis methods, explaining each license and method before detailing how to utilize these methods to rule out potential licenses based on specific outcomes.

## Software Licenses Overview

1. **GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3**: This is a free, copyleft license designed to ensure that users retain the freedom to modify and share software, especially when it's run over a network. It includes provisions for distribution and ensures end users have access to the source code.

2. **BSD 3-Clause License**: A permissive license that is a simple and concise alternative to the GNU licenses. It allows for redistribution and use in source and binary forms but does not permit sublicensing or copyleft requirements.

3. **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v2.1**: This license allows developers to link to libraries under it without being subjected to the strong copyleft nature of the regular GPL. It seeks a balance between permitting software linking and retaining some copyleft conditions.

4. **MIT License**: A permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is simple, requiring only that all copies of the software include the license terms.

## Analysis Methods and Outcomes

Each analysis method below evaluates a different aspect of the software license, allowing you to rule out licenses based on specific outcomes.

### 1. Anti-DRM Clause Identification

**Purpose**: Evaluates whether a license includes clauses against digital rights management (DRM).

- **Includes Anti-DRM Clause**: No licenses are ruled out.
- **No Anti-DRM Clause**: Rule out BSD 3-Clause License and MIT License.

### 2. Sublicensing Permissions Evaluation

**Purpose**: Determines if the license allows sublicensing of the software.

- **Sublicensing Allowed**: No licenses are ruled out.
- **Sublicensing Prohibited**: Rule out GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v2.1.

### 3. Copyleft Clause Examination

**Purpose**: Examines the strength of the copyleft provision, if any, in the license.

- **Strong Copyleft**: Rule out BSD 3-Clause License and MIT License.
- **Weak Copyleft**: Rule out MIT License and GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3.
- **No Copyleft**: No licenses are ruled out.

### 4. Usage Rights Evaluation

**Purpose**: Assesses whether the usage rights granted by the license are unrestricted or have limitations.

- **Usage Allowed**: Rule out GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3.
- **Usage Restricted**: Rule out MIT License.

### 5. Patent Clause Evaluation

**Purpose**: Checks if the license includes a clause granting patent rights.

- **Includes Patent Grant**: No licenses are ruled out.
- **No Patent Clause**: Rule out BSD 3-Clause License and MIT License.

### 6. Modification Rights Analysis

**Purpose**: Evaluates whether the right to modify the software is explicitly permitted.

- **Modification Allowed**: No licenses are ruled out.
- **Modification Not Allowed**: Rule out MIT License.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can methodically analyze software licenses to rule out specific ones based on various criteria. Each outcome from the analysis methods provide clarity on which licenses cannot be associated with certain conditions, thereby guiding you towards selecting the appropriate license for your needs. This ensures that you make informed decisions while adhering to the legal and operational requirements of software licensing.
