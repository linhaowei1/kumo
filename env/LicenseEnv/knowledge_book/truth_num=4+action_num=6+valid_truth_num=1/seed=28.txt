## **Software Licensing Analysis Guidebook**

## Introduction

Understanding software licenses is crucial for both developers and businesses to ensure compliance, manage risks, and make informed decisions regarding software use. This guidebook introduces several common types of software licenses and outlines methods for analyzing these licenses. By the end of this guide, you will understand how to assess specific license clauses and determine which licenses are applicable to your needs or should be ruled out based on certain criteria.

## Software Licenses Overview

Below, we provide a brief introduction to each of the selected software licenses:

1. **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC)**
   - This license allows users to share and adapt the work but strictly for non-commercial purposes. Attribution to the original creator is required.

2. **Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)**
   - A free and open-source license that allows the code to be used commercially while requiring modifications to be open-sourced similarly. It includes clauses for patent rights.

3. **BSD 3-Clause License**
   - A permissive free software license with minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. It does not impose restrictions on the inclusion of DRM (Digital Rights Management) technologies.

4. **WTFPL (Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License)**
   - An extremely permissive license that places no conditions or requirements, allowing for any kind of use without attribution or other obligations.

## Analysis Methods

### 1. Commercial Use Assessment
This method evaluates whether a license permits or restricts commercial use of the software:

- **Rule-Out Outcomes**:
  - If the license explicitly restricts commercial use, rule out:
    - Mozilla Public License 2.0
    - BSD 3-Clause License
  - If the license permits commercial use, rule out:
    - Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC)

### 2. Attribution Requirement Check
This involves determining whether a license mandates attribution to the original creators:

- **Rule-Out Outcomes**:
  - If the license clearly requires attribution, rule out:
    - WTFPL
  - No licenses need to be excluded for non-requirement of attribution.

### 3. Anti-DRM Clause Identification
This analysis identifies whether a license includes clauses that prohibit the application of DRM technologies:

- **Rule-Out Outcomes**:
  - For licenses without any anti-DRM clauses, rule out:
    - BSD 3-Clause License

### 4. Patent Retaliation Clause Examination
Focuses on whether a license contains clauses that could trigger retaliation in response to patent litigation:

- **Rule-Out Outcomes**:
  - If there's no provision for patent retaliation, rule out:
    - BSD 3-Clause License
  - With a moderate to high possibility of patent retaliation (from partial obligations to full), rule out:
    - Mozilla Public License 2.0

### 5. Patent Clause Evaluation
This involves checking for the inclusion of patent grants within the license:

- **Rule-Out Outcomes**:
  - If the license does not include patent clauses, rule out:
    - BSD 3-Clause License

### 6. Network Use Clause Evaluation
Evaluates if the license requires source code disclosure when the software is used over a network:

- **Rule-Out Outcomes**:
  - If there is no network source disclosure requirement, rule out:
    - BSD 3-Clause License

## Conclusion

The analysis of software licenses requires careful examination of various clauses to ensure compliance with legal and business requirements. By employing the analysis methods outlined above, you can effectively identify and rule out incompatible licenses based on specific business needs or legal obligations. Understanding and applying these rules will help in selecting the software license that aligns best with your organization's goals while mitigating any potential legal risks.
