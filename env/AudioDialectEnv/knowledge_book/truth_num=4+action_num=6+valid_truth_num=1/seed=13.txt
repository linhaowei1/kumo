# Guidebook on Audio Dialect Analysis

## Introduction to Language Dialects

This guidebook introduces the fascinating world of audio dialect analysis, focusing on four unique English dialects and the application of phonetic experiments to analyze them. Understanding these dialects involves examining specific phonetic characteristics that differentiate them.

### Language Dialects

1. **Polish English**: A variation of English influenced by native Polish speakers. It often features distinct phonetic traits due to the Polish language's influence on pronunciation.

2. **Yorkshire English**: Originating from the Yorkshire region in England, this dialect is known for its distinct pronunciation patterns and vocabulary.

3. **Estuary English**: A dialect from the southeastern parts of England, particularly around the Thames Estuary. It is characterized by certain phonetic features blending Received Pronunciation and Cockney.

4. **Californian English**: A dialect from the western United States, marked by its unique vowel shifts and relaxed pronunciation.

## Phonetic Analysis Experiments

To analyze the aforementioned dialects, several phonetic experiments can be performed. Each of these experiments focuses on detecting specific phonetic traits that can help differentiate between the dialects.

### Phonetic Experiments

1. **Phoneme Occurrence Analysis**:
   - **High occurrence of 'tʃ' and 'dʒ' sounds**: No dialects are excluded.
   - **Frequent use of 'θ' and 'ð' sounds**: Rule out 'Estuary English'.
   - **Predominant use of 'ŋg' clusters**: No dialects are excluded.

2. **Vowel Raising Measurement**:
   - **(0, 25)**: No dialects are excluded.
   - **(25, 75)**: No dialects are excluded.
   - **(75, 100)**: Rule out 'Californian English'.

3. **Palatalization Detection**:
   - **Frequent palatalization**: Rule out 'Polish English'.
   - **Rare palatalization**: No dialects are excluded.

4. **H-dropping Test**:
   - **Frequent H-dropping**: Rule out 'Estuary English' and 'Yorkshire English'.
   - **Rare H-dropping**: No dialects are excluded.

5. **U-fronting Analysis**:
   - **Strong U-fronting**: Rule out 'Estuary English'.
   - **Weak U-fronting**: No dialects are excluded.

6. **L-vocalization Test**:
   - **Presence of L-vocalization**: Rule out 'Estuary English'.
   - **Absence of L-vocalization**: No dialects are excluded.

## Conclusion

This guidebook presents a straightforward approach to analyzing dialects through phonetic experiments. The key to understanding these dialects lies in recognizing which phonetic characteristics are absent or significantly different from each other. By systematically applying the rule-out approach, you can narrow down potential dialects based on observed phonetic outcomes. Each analysis provides invaluable insights into the phonetic diversity and intricacies of English dialects.
