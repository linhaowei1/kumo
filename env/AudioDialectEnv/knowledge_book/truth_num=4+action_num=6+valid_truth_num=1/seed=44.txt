# Guidebook on Audio Dialect Analysis: An Introduction

## Introduction
Dialect analysis is a fascinating field within linguistics that provides insights into the variations and uniqueness of language use in different regions and communities. This guidebook focuses on analyzing specific language dialects using phonetic analysis experiments. Each dialect carries its own history and cultural significance, influencing its phonetic signatures.

The dialects explored in this guide include:
- **French-influenced dialects like Louisiana Creole English**
- **African-American Vernacular English**
- **Northern English Dialects**
- **Southern American English**

We categorize phonetic analysis experiments utilized to distinguish these dialects and outline the outcomes that lead to excluding certain dialects when specific phonetic traits are observed.

## Language Dialects
### 1. French-influenced Dialects like Louisiana Creole English
These dialects developed from French influence on English, notable in Louisiana, reflecting the state's rich cultural history. Influences are apparent in vocabulary, syntax, and occasionally, phonetics.

### 2. African-American Vernacular English (AAVE)
AAVE is a significant and vibrant dialect with roots in African languages, combined with English elements. It encompasses unique grammatical, lexical, and phonological features with a strong cultural connection.

### 3. Northern English Dialects
Encompassing a range of dialects found in northern England, these dialects can be identified by specific vowel sounds and intonation patterns differing from Southern English.

### 4. Southern American English
Originating in the Southern United States, this dialect features distinct vowel shifts and pronunciations, among the most researched in American dialectology.

## Phonetic Analysis Experiments and Outcomes

### 1. Stress Pattern Analysis
- **Experiment**: Focuses on stress placement in polysyllabic words.
- **Outcome Rule-Outs**:
  - When initial syllable stress in polysyllabic words is observed, **French-influenced dialects like Louisiana Creole English** are ruled out.
  - No dialects are uniquely ruled out by final syllable stress.

### 2. Vowel Raising Measurement
- **Experiment**: Measures the extent of vowel raising from low to high.
- **Outcome Rule-Outs**:
  - Observing vowel raising in the range of (0, 25) eliminates **Southern American English** as a possibility.
  - No dialects are ruled out for ranges (25, 75) and (75, 100).

### 3. Foot-Strut Split Test
- **Experiment**: Determines the presence or absence of the foot-strut split.
- **Outcome Rule-Outs**:
  - Absence of the foot-strut split rules out **Northern English Dialects**.

### 4. G-dropping Frequency
- **Experiment**: Measures the frequency of dropping the "g" sound in "-ing" endings.
- **Outcome Rule-Outs**:
  - High frequency (75, 100) of g-dropping rules out **Southern American English**.
  - No dialects are ruled out for ranges (0, 25) and (25, 75).

### 5. Diphthong Glide Analysis
- **Experiment**: Examines the presence or absence of diphthong glides.
- **Outcome Rule-Outs**:
  - Observing monophthongization rules out **Southern American English**.
  - Retention of diphthongs does not rule out any specific dialects.

### 6. Vowel Length Measurement
- **Experiment**: Assesses the relative length of vowel sounds.
- **Outcome Rule-Outs**:
  - Longer vowel length (67, 100) excludes **Southern American English**.
  - No dialects are ruled out for shorter vowel lengths (0, 33).

## Conclusion
Understanding dialects through phonetic experiments provides a reliable method to analyze and categorize speech patterns. By observing specific phonetic traits and employing an exclusion-based approach, linguists can systematically narrow down potential dialects for given speech samples. This guidebook serves as a foundational reference for anyone interested in delving into the intricate world of audio dialect analysis.
