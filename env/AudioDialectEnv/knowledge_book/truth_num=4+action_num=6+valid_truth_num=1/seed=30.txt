# Guidebook on Audio Dialect Analysis

This guidebook explores the fascinating field of audio dialect analysis, focusing on selected English dialects and phonetic analysis experiments. It aims to provide insights into identifying and distinguishing between different dialects through various phonetic experiments. 

## Language Dialects Overview

In our study, we focus on four specific dialects of English:

1. **French English**: Characterized by the influence of French phonetics on English, which can affect pronunciation and intonation.
  
2. **Indian English**: Known for its distinctive pronunciation, including unique vowel sounds and often a retroflex sound for certain consonants.
  
3. **New Zealand English**: Distinguished by its vowel shifts and rhotic sounds, with particular variations in the pronunciation of some common phonemes.
  
4. **London English**: Often associated with Cockney or Estuary accents, featuring unique features like the glottal stop and vowel shifts.

## Phonetic Analysis Experiments

We utilize a series of phonetic experiments to discern linguistic differences and rule out specific dialects based on observed outcomes.

### 1. Nasalization Measurement

This experiment measures the nasal quality in speech sounds. Nasalization refers to when airflow passes through the nose while producing a sound that typically doesn't require it.

- **Outcome: (0, 33)**: Dialects excluding **Indian English**.
- **Outcome: (67, 100)**: No dialects ruled out.

### 2. L-vocalization Test

L-vocalization involves the substitution of the /l/ sound with a vowel or semivowel, particularly in word-final or pre-consonantal positions.

- **Presence of L-vocalization**: Dialects excluding **New Zealand English**.
- **Absence of L-vocalization**: No dialects ruled out.

### 3. U-fronting Analysis

U-fronting refers to the articulation of the /u/ vowel sound closer to the front of the mouth than usual.

- **Strong U-fronting**: Dialects excluding **London English**.
- **Weak U-fronting**: No dialects ruled out.

### 4. Rhoticity Test

Rhoticity indicates whether or not the /r/ sound is pronounced in words like "car" or "hard."

- **Non-rhotic speech**: Dialects excluding **New Zealand English**.
- **Rhotic speech**: No dialects ruled out.
- **Variable rhoticity**: No dialects ruled out.

### 5. H-dropping Test

H-dropping occurs when the /h/ sound is omitted at the beginning of words like "hat" or "house."

- **Frequent H-dropping**: No dialects ruled out.
- **Rare H-dropping**: Dialects excluding **Indian English**.

### 6. Vocabulary Usage Comparison

This involves comparing the preference for British or American vocabulary terms in spoken English.

- **British English terms**: Dialects excluding **Indian English**.
- **American English terms**: No dialects ruled out.

## Conclusion

Understanding and identifying dialects through phonetic experiments involves assessing specific linguistic characteristics and making careful observations. The outcomes of these experiments help to rule out certain dialects based on presence or absence of features, thus narrowing down possibilities. By following the above experiments and outcomes, researchers and linguists can effectively analyze and identify dialects with greater precision.
