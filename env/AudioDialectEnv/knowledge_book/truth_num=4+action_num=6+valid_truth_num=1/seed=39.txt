# Guidebook on Audio Dialect Analysis: Language Dialects and Phonetic Experiments

## Introduction to Language Dialects

This guidebook provides an overview of audio dialect analysis, focusing on four specific English dialects and how various phonetic experiments can help in identifying or ruling out these dialects. The language dialects under study are:

1. **Welsh English**: Known for its unique intonation patterns and retention of older English phonological traits. It may exhibit features akin to nearby Celtic languages.
   
2. **Polish English**: Typically characterized by the influence of Polish phonetics, including potential vowel differences and consonant articulations not common in native English dialects.
   
3. **New Zealand English**: Distinctive for its vowel shifts (such as the 'short i' pronounced as a 'schwa' sound), and certain consonantal phenomena like yod-coalescence and L-vocalization.
   
4. **Scottish English**: Recognized by its rhoticity, a strong presence of the 'r' sound, and distinct phonemes such as the 'velar fricative /x/' present in some varieties.

## Phonetic Analysis Experiments

The dialect analysis involves six phonetic experiments, each yielding specific outcomes that can rule out certain dialects:

### 1. Phoneme Occurrence Analysis

This analysis observes the presence and frequency of certain phonemes. The outcomes guide the exclusion of language dialects as follows:

- **High occurrence of 'tʃ' and 'dʒ' sounds**
  - Dialects ruled out: **Scottish English**, **Welsh English**
- **Frequent use of 'θ' and 'ð' sounds**
  - Dialects ruled out: None
- **Predominant use of 'ŋg' clusters**
  - Dialects ruled out: None

### 2. L-vocalization Test

The L-vocalization test examines the transformation of the “l” sound into a vowel or semi-vowel in specific positions.

- **Presence of L-vocalization**
  - Dialects ruled out: **New Zealand English**
- **Absence of L-vocalization**
  - Dialects ruled out: None

### 3. Yod-coalescence Detection

This experiment identifies whether yod-coalescence (the merging of /j/ with preceding consonants) is present.

- **Presence of Yod-coalescence**
  - Dialects ruled out: **New Zealand English**
- **Absence of Yod-coalescence**
  - Dialects ruled out: None

### 4. TH-fronting Detection

TH-fronting analysis looks for the replacement of /θ/ and /ð/ with /f/ and /v/, respectively.

- **Presence of TH-fronting**
  - Dialects ruled out: None
- **Absence of TH-fronting**
  - Dialects ruled out: **Scottish English**
- **Variable TH-fronting**
  - Dialects ruled out: None

### 5. Rhoticity Test

This test determines whether the dialect is rhotic (pronouncing the r in all contexts) or non-rhotic.

- **Non-rhotic speech**
  - Dialects ruled out: **New Zealand English**
- **Rhotic speech**
  - Dialects ruled out: **Scottish English**
- **Variable rhoticity**
  - Dialects ruled out: None

### 6. Pitch Accent Measurement

This measurement assesses the typical pitch range used in speech, which can vary significantly among dialects.

- **Pitch range (0, 30)**
  - Dialects ruled out: None
- **Pitch range (30, 70)**
  - Dialects ruled out: **Scottish English**

## Conclusion

By utilizing these phonetic tests, one can effectively rule out certain dialects based on observable phonetic phenomena, thereby narrowing down the potential dialects present in a given audio sample. This analytical framework helps linguists and phonologists determine the most likely English dialect in diverse contexts of speech.
