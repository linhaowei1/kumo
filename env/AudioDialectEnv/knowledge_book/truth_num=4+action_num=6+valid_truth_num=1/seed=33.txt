## Introduction to Language Dialects

### Overview
Language dialects are variants of a language that are distinct in their vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. This guide focuses on analyzing dialects through phonetic experiments to identify unique features and rule out possibilities based on observed outcomes.

### Dialects Covered
1. **Cockney English**: A traditional working-class dialect from London, known for its distinct phonetic characteristics, such as TH-fronting.
2. **South African English**: A variety of English spoken in South Africa, influenced by the country's diverse linguistic landscape.
3. **Californian English**: A dialect characteristic of California, often marked by specific vowel sounds.
4. **Singaporean English**: Commonly referred to as "Singlish," this dialect includes influences from other languages like Mandarin and Malay, alongside English.

## Phonetic Analysis Experiments

### Rhoticity Test
- **Purpose**: To examine whether the dialect includes pronounced 'r' sounds post-vocalically.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Non-rhotic Speech**: If detected, **exclude Cockney English and South African English** as these are inherently non-rhotic.
  - **Rhotic Speech**: No dialects excluded.
  - **Variable Rhoticity**: No dialects excluded.

### Vowel Raising Measurement
- **Purpose**: Assesses the elevation of tongue position in vowel sounds.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **(0, 25)**: No dialects excluded.
  - **(25, 75)**: No dialects excluded.
  - **(75, 100)**: If observed, **exclude Californian English**, as it features significant raising.

### Non-rhotic 'R' Occurrence
- **Purpose**: Analyzes the absence of 'r' in speech where it might be expected in rhotic varieties.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **(0, 25)**: If less frequent, **exclude Cockney English**, as it tends towards frequent non-rhotic usage.
  - **(75, 100)**: No dialects excluded.

### TH-fronting Detection
- **Purpose**: Identifies if TH sounds (as in "think") are pronounced like 'f' (as in "fink").
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Presence of TH-fronting**: If detected, **exclude Cockney English**.
  - **Absence of TH-fronting**: No dialects excluded.
  - **Variable TH-fronting**: No dialects excluded.

### Diphthong Shift Analysis
- **Purpose**: Evaluation of changes in diphthong pronunciations over time.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Significant Shift Observed**: If observed, **exclude Cockney English** due to its notable shifts.
  - **No Significant Shift**: No dialects excluded.

### L-vocalization Test
- **Purpose**: Checks if 'l' sounds are vocalized or turned into a vowel-like sound.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Presence of L-vocalization**: If detected, **exclude Cockney English**, which often features L-vocalization.
  - **Absence of L-vocalization**: No dialects excluded.

## Conclusion
By employing these phonetic experiments, one can rule out certain dialects based on specific speech characteristics. This guide provides a structured approach to dialect analysis, allowing for systematic exclusion of possibilities to narrow down and identify the correct dialects based on observed phonetic outcomes.
