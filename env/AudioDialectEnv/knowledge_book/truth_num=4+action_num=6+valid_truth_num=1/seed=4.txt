# Guidebook on Audio Dialect Analysis: Language Dialects and Phonetic Analysis Experiments 

## Introduction to Language Dialects

Language dialects are variations of a language distinguished by phonetic, grammatical, and lexical differences. In this guide, we focus on four English dialects:

1. **Australian English**: Known for its unique vowel pronunciation and vocabulary, it bears similarities to British English but has distinct phonetic characteristics.

2. **African American Vernacular English (AAVE)**: A dialect of English with roots in the African American community, identified by its unique grammatical structures and phonetic patterns.

3. **Quebec English**: Spoken in Quebec, Canada, this dialect is influenced by both Canadian and French English, showing unique traits especially in phonetic articulation.

4. **Scottish English**: Characterized by its distinct phonemic inventory and strong influences from Scots language, it varies widely across regions in Scotland.

## Phonetic Analysis Experiments

To analyze the dialects mentioned above, we conduct specific phonetic experiments. Each experiment helps to narrow down possibilities by ruling out dialects based on observed outcomes.

### Experiment 1: Vowel Nasalization Occurrence

This experiment identifies how often vowels are nasalized in speech.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **0-25% Nasalization**: No dialects are ruled out.
  - **25-75% Nasalization**: **Quebec English** is ruled out.

### Experiment 2: Monophthongization Test

Monophthongization refers to the pronunciation of a diphthong as a single vowel sound.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Monophthongization present**: **African American Vernacular English** is ruled out.
  - **Absent**: No dialects are ruled out.

### Experiment 3: Trap-Bath Split Test

This test examines whether the vowel difference between 'trap' and 'bath' words exists.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Trap-Bath split present**: **Australian English** is ruled out.
  - **No Trap-Bath split**: No dialects are ruled out.

### Experiment 4: Intrusive 'R' Occurrence

This experiment observes the insertion of an 'r' sound between vowels where it does not traditionally exist.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **High occurrence of intrusive R**: **Australian English** is ruled out.
  - **Low occurrence of intrusive R**: No dialects are ruled out.

### Experiment 5: Vowel Length Measurement

Vowel length measurement identifies how long vowels are pronounced in speech.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **0-33% Vowel Length**: **Scottish English** is ruled out.
  - **67-100% Vowel Length**: **Australian English** is ruled out.

### Experiment 6: Non-rhotic 'R' Occurrence

Non-rhoticity describes the omission of 'r' sounds at the end of words or before consonants.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **0-25% Non-rhotic R**: **Australian English** is ruled out.
  - **75-100% Non-rhotic R**: **Scottish English** is ruled out.

## Conclusion

Dialect analysis through phonetic experiments allows us to exclude certain dialects under specific observable outcomes. By following this guide, researchers can systematically narrow down dialect possibilities and gain deeper insights into the characteristics of different English dialects. This approach fosters a structured understanding of language variation and phonetic phenomena.
