# Guidebook on Audio Dialect Analysis

## Introduction to Language Dialects

Language dialects form a fascinating aspect of linguistic diversity. This guidebook focuses on four specific English dialects along with a blend influenced by French, examining their unique phonetic characteristics.

### 1. New Zealand English
New Zealand English is known for its distinctive vowel shifts and non-rhotic accent, meaning the 'r' sound at the end of words or after a vowel is often not pronounced.

### 2. French-influenced Dialects (e.g., Louisiana Creole English)
Dialect variations influenced by French, such as Louisiana Creole English, often feature laconic speech patterns and distinct vowel sounds, retaining strong nasal influences from French.

### 3. Western American English
Characterized by the Western US region, Western American English often includes notable vowel mergers, such as the caught-cot merger, where 'caught' and 'cot' sound the same.

### 4. Polish English
Polish English exhibits distinctive features due to Polish language influence, including frequent palatalization, where sounds are pronounced with the body of the tongue raised towards the hard palate.

## Phonetic Analysis Experiments

Phonetic analysis experiments are methodologies used to identify and analyze dialect features based on pronunciation patterns. Below are descriptions of the experiments and their outcomes in determining which dialects can be ruled out:

### 1. Non-rhotic 'R' Occurrence
**Objective**: Identify the presence or absence of rhotic 'r' sounds.

**Outcome Interpretation**:
- **(0, 25) Occurrence**: Rules out **New Zealand English**. This indicates the absence or minimal use of rhotic 'r', similar to non-rhotic accents.
- **(75, 100) Occurrence**: Rules out no specific dialects as this experiment state was empty.

### 2. Nasalization Measurement
**Objective**: Measure nasal sound presence. 

**Outcome Interpretation**:
- **(0, 33) Measurement**: Does not rule out any dialects.
- **(67, 100) Measurement**: Rules out **French-influenced dialects like Louisiana Creole English**, indicating a stronger nasal quality.

### 3. Vowel Merger Detection
**Objective**: Identify the merging of particular vowel sounds.

**Outcome Interpretation**:
- **Caught-cot Merger Detection**: Rules out **Western American English**, where these vowels are pronounced the same.
- **Caught-cot distinctly marked**: Does not rule out any dialects.

### 4. Yod-coalescence Detection
**Objective**: Check for the blending of the 'y' sound with subsequent consonants like 'ch' and 'j'.

**Outcome Interpretation**:
- **Presence of Yod-coalescence**: Rules out **New Zealand English**, showing instances of this sound merging.
- **Absence of Yod-coalescence**: Does not rule out any dialects.

### 5. Rhoticity Test
**Objective**: Assess the use of rhotic 'r'.

**Outcome Interpretation**:
- **Non-rhotic speech**: Rules out **New Zealand English**, characterized by dropping the 'r' sound.
- **Rhotic speech**: Does not rule out any dialects.
- **Variable Rhoticity**: Does not rule out any dialects.

### 6. Palatalization Detection
**Objective**: Investigate the occurrence of palatalization, where sounds are pronounced closer to the hard palate.

**Outcome Interpretation**:
- **Frequent Palatalization**: Rules out **Polish English**, which frequently exhibits this speech trait.
- **Rare Palatalization**: Does not rule out any dialects.

## Conclusion

This guidebook has outlined the relationship between specific dialect features and their identification through a range of phonetic experiments. By recognizing the states and exclusions noted within each experiment, linguistic analysts can better discern among the dialects of English, narrowing down options based on observed phonetic behavior. Understanding these dialectal nuances not only enriches our comprehension of language diversity but also enhances our ability to analyze language systematically.
