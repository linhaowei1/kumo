# Soil Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Soil Analysis Guidebook, designed to help you understand various soil types and how different experiments can help identify or rule out certain soils based on their characteristics and conditions. This guide focuses on four primary soil types and six fundamental experiments. 

## Soil Types

### 1. Tundra Soil
Tundra Soil is typically found in cold regions, often experiencing short summers and long, harsh winters. It is known for its low biological activity and slow decomposition rates.

### 2. Gley Soil
Gley Soil is characterized by its greyish color, often resulting from water saturation and poor drainage, leading to the reduction of iron and sulfur compounds.

### 3. Silty Soil
Silty Soil is smooth and slippery with high silt content. It is known for its excellent fertility and ability to retain moisture without compromising drainage significantly.

### 4. Loamy Soil
Loamy Soil is a well-balanced combination of sand, silt, and clay, offering excellent fertility and strong structure, which makes it highly desirable for agriculture.

## Experiments

This section describes experiments used to analyze soils and how the findings can help rule out certain soil types based on empirical results.

### Particle Size Analysis
This experiment determines the size distribution of the soil particles.

- **High Sand Content**: No specific soil types ruled out.
- **High Clay Content**: No specific soil types ruled out.
- **Balanced Texture**: When a balanced texture is observed, **Silty Soil** can be ruled out as a possibility.

### Soil Temperature Measurement
Soil temperature affects its biological activity and characteristics.

- **Temperature Range 0.0 - 10.0°C**: No specific soil types ruled out.
- **Temperature Range 10.0 - 30.0°C**: **Tundra Soil** is ruled out.
- **Temperature Range 30.0 - 100.0°C**: **Tundra Soil** is ruled out.

### Soil Water Holding Capacity Test
This test evaluates the soil's ability to retain water, crucial for plant growth.

- **Capacity Range 0.0 - 0.1**: No specific soil types ruled out.
- **Capacity Range 0.1 - 0.2**: **Loamy Soil** is ruled out.
- **Capacity Range 0.2 - 0.5**: No specific soil types ruled out.

### Soil Structure Analysis
Soil structure affects aeration, drainage, and root penetration.

- **Granular Structure**: No specific soil types ruled out.
- **Massive Structure**: **Loamy Soil** is ruled out as it typically does not exhibit a massive structure.
- **Blocky Structure**: No specific soil types ruled out.

### Electrical Conductivity Test
Electrical conductivity measures the soil's ionic content, indicating its fertility and salinity level.

- **Conductivity Range 0.0 - 2.0**: No specific soil types ruled out.
- **Conductivity Range 2.0 - 4.0**: No specific soil types ruled out.
- **Conductivity Range 4.0 - 16.0**: **Loamy Soil** is ruled out, indicating it would generally not have such high conductivity levels.

### Soil Redox Potential Test
Redox potential reflects soil's oxidative or reductive conditions, influencing nutrient availability.

- **Redox Range -400.0 - 0.0**: **Loamy Soil** is ruled out, suggesting conditions too reducing for this soil type.
- **Redox Range 0.0 - 400.0**: **Gley Soil** is ruled out because it typically exists under more reduced conditions.

By conducting these experiments and considering the observed outcomes, analysts can make informed decisions on the soil type present at a given site. Use this guide to facilitate soil analysis objectives seamlessly, ensuring each outcome's nuances and rule-out criteria are clear and accurately applied.
