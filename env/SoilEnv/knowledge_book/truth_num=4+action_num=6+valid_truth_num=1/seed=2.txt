# Soil Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook is designed to help you understand different soil types and conduct various experiments to determine their characteristics. By carefully observing the outcomes of these tests, you can exclude certain soil types from consideration, thus narrowing down the possibilities to identify the soil you are dealing with.

## Soil Types

1. **Aridisol**
   - Typically found in arid regions where moisture is scarce.
   - Characterized by limited organic matter and often has accumulations of salts or calcium carbonate.

2. **Calcisol**
   - Known for having high calcium levels.
   - Often found in regions with significant calcium carbonate content in the soil profile.

3. **Lithosol**
   - Shallow soil mainly composed of rock fragments.
   - Has low water retention and limited agricultural utility.

4. **Loamy Soil**
   - A well-balanced soil made up of sand, silt, and clay.
   - Known for its excellent water-holding capacity and fertility, making it ideal for agriculture.

## Experiments and Interpretations

### 1. Soil Water Holding Capacity Test
This test measures the amount of water that soil can retain.

- **Outcomes & Interpretations:**
  - Water holding capacity between 0.0 and 0.1: No soil types are ruled out. Further testing is needed.
  - Water holding capacity between 0.1 and 0.2: Exclude Loamy Soil.
  - Water holding capacity between 0.2 and 0.5: Exclude Aridisol.

### 2. Soil Redox Potential Test
This experiment determines the soil's oxidation-reduction potential, indicating the availability of oxygen and other factors affecting root and microbial activity.

- **Outcomes & Interpretations:**
  - Redox potential between -400.0 and 0.0: Exclude Calcisol and Loamy Soil.
  - Redox potential between 0.0 and 400.0: No soil types are ruled out.

### 3. Soil Phosphorus Test
A test to assess the level of phosphorus, which is essential for plant growth.

- **Outcomes & Interpretations:**
  - High Phosphorus Level: Exclude Aridisol.
  - Low Phosphorus Level: No soil types are ruled out.

### 4. Infiltration Rate Test
This measures the speed at which water passes through the soil, reflecting potential drainage rates and penetration efficiency.

- **Outcomes & Interpretations:**
  - Infiltration rate between 0.0 and 0.5: Exclude Aridisol.
  - Infiltration rate between 0.5 and 2.0: No soil types are ruled out.
  - Infiltration rate between 2.0 and 10.0: No soil types are ruled out.

### 5. Organic Matter Content Test
This test measures the quantity of organic matter present, which is crucial for soil fertility and microbial activity.

- **Outcomes & Interpretations:**
  - Organic matter content between 0.0 and 2.0: No soil types are ruled out.
  - Organic matter content between 2.0 and 5.0: No soil types are ruled out.
  - Organic matter content between 5.0 and 70.0: Exclude Calcisol and Aridisol.

### 6. Soil Calcium Test
Assesses calcium levels, a vital plant nutrient, and component in soil structure.

- **Outcomes & Interpretations:**
  - High Calcium Level: No soil types are ruled out.
  - Low Calcium Level: Exclude Calcisol.

## Conclusion
By utilizing these tests and carefully analyzing the results, you can systematically rule out incompatible soil types. This will assist in narrowing down the potential options and providing a better understanding of your soil. Remember that multiple tests and outcomes should be considered together for a more accurate soil profile analysis.
