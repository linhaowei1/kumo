# Guidebook for Analyzing Circus Performances

This guidebook serves as a comprehensive resource for analyzing circus performances, focusing on several core acrobatic techniques and modern analysis methods used to critically assess these performances. By understanding and applying these methods, observers can gain insights into which techniques are being performed by identifying those that are ruled out by certain outcomes. The following sections cover each acrobatic technique, the available analysis methods, and explicitly detail how various outcomes can exclude specific techniques.

## Acrobatic Techniques

### 1. Flying Trapeze
This iconic circus act involves acrobats soaring through the air between trapeze bars. Flying trapeze acts are characterized by their height and agility, often necessitating safety nets below.

### 2. Elephant Acts
In traditional circuses, elephants perform incredible feats of balance and coordination. These acts typically emphasize the animal's strength and intelligence, operating on stage rather than in the air.

### 3. Object Manipulation
Encompassing various skills like juggling, plate spinning, and balancing objects, object manipulation acts require precision and timing. These acts are typically performed on the ground and can vary greatly in complexity.

### 4. Human Cannonball
A thrilling and high-risk act where a performer is launched from a cannon across the circus ring. It requires intense preparation and safety precautions, given the extreme nature and height involved.

## Body Position Analysis and Timing & Motion Studies

To effectively evaluate and differentiate between circus acts, we employ a set of analysis methods:

### Height Measurement
- **Outcome Rule-out**: 
  - Height between 0 and 2 meters: Rules out 'Human Cannonball' and 'Flying Trapeze'
  - Height between 2 and 10 meters: Rules out 'Object Manipulation'
  - Height above 10 meters: No specific exclusions

### Risk Factor Assessment
- **Outcome Rule-out**: 
  - High-risk performance: Rules out 'Human Cannonball' and 'Flying Trapeze'
  - Low-risk performance: No specific exclusions

### Pyrotechnic Residue Detection
- **Outcome Rule-out**: 
  - Presence of residue: No specific exclusions
  - No residue: Rules out 'Human Cannonball'

### Performance Duration Timing
- **Outcome Rule-out**: 
  - Duration between 0.0 and 5.0 minutes: Rules out 'Human Cannonball'
  - Duration between 5.0 and 30.0 minutes: No specific exclusions

### Sound Analysis
- **Outcome Rule-out**: 
  - Loud mechanical sounds: No specific exclusions
  - Quiet performance: Rules out 'Human Cannonball'

### Weight Measurement
- **Outcome Rule-out**: 
  - Weight between 0.0 and 50.0 kilograms: Rules out 'Elephant Acts'
  - Weight above 50.0 kilograms: No specific exclusions

## Conclusion

Through the application of these analysis methods, it is possible to eliminate unlikely acrobatic techniques, leaving observers with a clearer picture of what performance is taking place. Understanding these connections allows for a more refined and accurate assessment of the circus spectacle being observed.
