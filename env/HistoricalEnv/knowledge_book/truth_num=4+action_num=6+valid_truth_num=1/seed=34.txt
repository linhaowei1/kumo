# Historical Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Historical Analysis Guidebook, a resource designed to guide you through the fascinating world of historical research. By examining pivotal historical events and periods alongside advanced research methods, we can develop a nuanced understanding of the past. This guidebook will introduce four significant historical events or periods and explore six research methods used to rule out incorrect associations using given data outcomes.

## Historical Events or Periods

### Sumerian Civilization
The Sumerian Civilization, one of the world's earliest and most influential civilizations, emerged in Mesopotamia around 4500 BCE. Known for developing the cuneiform script and monumental architecture such as ziggurats, the Sumerians significantly influenced future societies.

### Prohibition Era
The Prohibition Era refers to the period in the United States from 1920 to 1933 when the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages were banned. This era was marked by the rise of organized crime and significant social and political change.

### Russian Revolution
The Russian Revolution of 1917 was a period of political turmoil resulting in the overthrow of the Russian monarchy and the establishment of the Soviet Union. It consisted of two key events: the February Revolution and the October Revolution.

### The Fall of the Berlin Wall
The Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 symbolized the end of the Cold War and the impending reunification of East and West Germany. This event marked a significant shift towards democracy in Eastern Europe and a move away from Soviet influence.

## Research Methods

### Carbon Dating
Carbon Dating is a scientific method used to date organic materials by measuring the decay of carbon-14 isotopes. When employing Carbon Dating, we find:

- **(0, 1500):** This outcome means "The Fall of the Berlin Wall," "Prohibition Era," and "Russian Revolution" must be excluded as possibilities.
- **(1500, 2000):** This outcome rules out "Sumerian Civilization."

### Geoarchaeology
Geoarchaeology integrates geological techniques to study historical and prehistoric sites. This includes:

- **Soil Analysis:** No specific events are excluded with this outcome.
- **Sediment Core:** This outcome excludes "Sumerian Civilization."

### Dendrochronology
Dendrochronology involves tree-ring dating to understand past climatic conditions and timelines. Outcomes observed are:

- **(0, 1000):** "Prohibition Era" is excluded as a possibility.
- **(1000, 2000):** "Sumerian Civilization" is ruled out.

### Molecular Archaeology
This method uses molecular analysis to investigate ancient biological remains. Outcomes for Molecular Archaeology include:

- **Ancient DNA:** Excludes the validity of "Prohibition Era."
- **Isotopic Analysis:** This outcome excludes "Sumerian Civilization."

### Stratigraphy
Stratigraphy examines rock layers and layering to understand chronological sequencing. Relevant outcomes are:

- **Deep Layer:** This outcome rules out "Prohibition Era."
- **Shallow Layer:** No specific events are precluded.

### Artifact Examination
This technique involves examining objects wielded or made by past humans to understand culture and technology. Outcomes connected to artifact types are:

- **Stone Tools:** "Prohibition Era" must be ruled out with this outcome.
- **Iron Weapons:** This outcome does not exclude any specific events.

This guidebook serves as an essential resource to elucidate how historical events are analyzed and determined using various research methods. Utilizing these outcomes helps refine our understanding by systematically excluding possibilities that do not align with observed evidence.
