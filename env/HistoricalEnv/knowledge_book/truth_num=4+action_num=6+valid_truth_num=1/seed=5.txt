# Historical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

Understanding past events and periods is crucial to comprehending our present and shaping our future. By employing various research methods, historians and archaeologists piece together narratives from different eras. This guidebook introduces four significant historical events or periods—the Aztec Empire, the Age of Exploration, the Great Depression, and the Space Race—alongside key research methods used to study them. Each method can, through its outcomes, help to exclude possibilities and refine our understanding of historical contexts.

## Historical Events or Periods

### Aztec Empire
The Aztec Empire flourished in central Mexico during the 14th to 16th centuries until it was conquered by Spanish forces. Known for its rich culture, advanced engineering, and complex social structure, this empire left behind a legacy of monumental architecture and artifacts.

### Age of Exploration
Spanning approximately from the 15th to the 17th century, the Age of Exploration was marked by European powers exploring and colonizing vast parts of the world. This period led to increased globalization, the exchange of goods and ideas, and significant shifts in power dynamics.

### Great Depression
The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic downturn in the 1930s, starting with the U.S. stock market crash in 1929. It led to widespread unemployment, poverty, and significant changes in economic policies globally.

### Space Race
The Space Race was a mid-20th-century competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, focusing on achieving significant space exploration milestones. Starting with the launch of Sputnik in 1957, it included pivotal achievements like landing the first humans on the Moon in 1969.

## Research Methods

### Dendrochronology
This method involves analyzing tree rings to date historical events and environmental changes. When dendrochronology shows outcomes between 0 and 1000, the Space Race is ruled out. For outcomes from 1000 to 2000, the Aztec Empire is excluded.

### Molecular Archaeology
Molecular archaeology utilizes technologies like ancient DNA and isotopic analysis to understand past societies. When ancient DNA is analyzed, the Space Race and Great Depression can be excluded as interpretations. Using isotopic analysis, interpretations that include the Aztec Empire should be ruled out.

### Geoarchaeology
Geoarchaeology combines earth sciences with archaeology to study soil and sediment. Soil analysis outcomes necessitate excluding the Space Race. No historical period is ruled out for sediment core analysis in the dataset provided.

### Artifact Examination
Analyzing artifacts, like stone tools, provides insights into past cultural practices. If stone tools are examined, the possibility of their association with the Space Race and Age of Exploration is excluded. The analysis of iron weapons does not exclude any of the historical events listed.

### Carbon Dating
This technique measures the decay of carbon isotopes to date organic materials. Outcomes from carbon dating between 0 and 1500 rule out associations with the Space Race and Great Depression, whereas those between 1500 and 2000 exclude the Aztec Empire.

### Stratigraphy
Stratigraphy studies the layers of soil and rock deposits to understand the chronological sequence of events. When a deep layer outcome is observed, the Space Race is excluded, while shallow layer outcomes do not rule out any historical periods from the list.

## Conclusion

Understanding the relationships between historical events and the research methods used to study them allows for a more nuanced comprehension of history. Each method discussed in this guide provides a unique lens through which histories are analyzed, and their outcomes guide historians by ruling out certain possibilities. This exclusion approach streamlines research by narrowing down the feasible narratives and focusing on those most supported by evidence.
