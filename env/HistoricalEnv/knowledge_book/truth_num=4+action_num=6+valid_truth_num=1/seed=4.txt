## Historical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is intended to provide an introduction to several significant historical events and periods, alongside a comprehensive overview of various research methods utilized in historical analysis. Our goal is to elucidate the contexts and relationships between these events and methods, focusing on the outcomes that help historians eliminate certain periods or events as possibilities when specific research findings are observed.

## Historical Events or Periods

### Aztec Empire
The Aztec Empire was a Mesoamerican culture that flourished in central Mexico in the post-classic period from 1300 to 1521. Noted for its complex societal structures, monumental architecture, and rich cultural heritage, the Aztec Empire is a focal point for historians studying this period of pre-Columbian history.

### Russian Revolution
The Russian Revolution of 1917 marked the fall of the Russian Empire and ushered in the Soviet Union's establishment. It was characterized by mass protests, political upheavals, and significant shifts in power, which dramatically altered the course of 20th-century history.

### Great Depression
The Great Depression was a severe global economic downturn that occurred during the 1930s. It began with the stock market crash in 1929 and had profound social, economic, and political impacts across the world.

### Ancient Mesopotamia
Ancient Mesopotamia, often referred to as the cradle of civilization, is known for early developments in writing, urbanization, agriculture, and governance. Situated in the land between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, this region played a pivotal role in the advancement of human culture.

## Research Methods

### Carbon Dating
Carbon dating is an established technique used to determine the age of an artifact or site by measuring the decay of carbon isotopes. This method is invaluable for creating chronological frameworks in archaeology.

#### Outcomes:
- When carbon dating indicates an age between 0 and 1500, the Russian Revolution and the Great Depression are ruled out, as these events occurred after this period.
- Conversely, when the date determined is between 1500 and 2000, Ancient Mesopotamia and the Aztec Empire are excluded, as they existed well before and during the earlier part of this time frame.

### Molecular Archaeology
Molecular archaeology involves analyzing the molecular composition of biological remains to learn about past human activities, diets, and environments.

#### Outcomes:
- With Ancient DNA analysis, Ancient Mesopotamia and the Great Depression are excluded as focal points because this technique is often used to study much older periods and not primarily for recent events like the Great Depression.
- Isotopic analysis, when pointing towards human or animal remnants, excludes the Aztec Empire, indicating the limitations this method has when applied to fresher periods or aspects of Aztec civilization.

### Dendrochronology
Dendrochronology, or tree-ring dating, relies on analyzing growth rings in trees to date events or environmental changes accurately.

#### Outcomes:
- For dates before 1000, dendrochronology isn't applicable here.
- When utilized for periods after 1000, it excludes Ancient Mesopotamia and the Aztec Empire as circles of interest.

### Stratigraphy
Stratigraphy involves analyzing soil layers (strata) to understand chronological sequence. This method helps archaeologists differentiate between layers to map historical timelines.

#### Outcomes:
- Regardless of whether the layer is deep or shallow, this method currently doesnâ€™t affect the inclusion or exclusion of any specific historical periods in this analysis.

### Geoarchaeology
Geoarchaeology applies earth science techniques to analyze archaeological sites, providing insight into past landscapes and environments.

#### Outcomes:
- Neither soil analysis nor sediment cores rule out any specific events as possibilities. Although insightful, this approach doesn't directly exclude any period from being considered under examined contexts.

### Artifact Examination
Artifact examination involves studying physical objects made or used by past human societies, such as tools, weapons, or artwork, to reconstruct past behaviors and events.

#### Outcomes:
- Examination of stone tools and iron weapons doesn't specifically exclude any of the historical periods mentioned.

This guide equips historians with the knowledge necessary to apply each research method, understanding their strengths in ruling out events or periods during the investigation of historical contexts. Accurate analysis relies on understanding not only the confirmatory potential of methods but also their exclusive capacity.
