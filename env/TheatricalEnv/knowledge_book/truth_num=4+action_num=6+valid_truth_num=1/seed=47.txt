This guidebook introduces you to different theatrical genres and outlines a set of script analysis activities that provide insight into these genres. Importantly, it details how certain observations during the analysis can rule out potential genres for a given piece, aiding in pinpointing the true nature of the work.

### Theatrical Genres
1. **Greek Tragedy**: Ancient plays that often involve serious themes such as fate, destiny, and the divine, generally characterized by the use of elaborate language and formal structure.
2. **Vaudeville**: A genre of theatrical variety entertainment, encompassing a mix of specialty acts such as comedy, song, and dance, known for being light-hearted and whimsical.
3. **Tragicomedy**: A blend of tragedy and comedy, this genre presents varied emotional tones, often weaving serious themes with humorous elements.
4. **Social Realism**: A genre focused on depicting real-life issues and societal challenges, frequently characterized by a serious and often philosophical approach to storytelling.

## Script Analysis Activities

### 1. Setting Analysis
An exploration of the time and place where the play is set can reveal much about the play's genre:
- **Futuristic Settings**: If the setting analysis reveals a futuristic setting, Vaudeville can be ruled out, as it is more commonly associated with historical or contemporary settings.

### 2. Use of Mask and Costume Check
Costume design can be a strong indicator of genre:
- **Elaborate Masks and Costumes**: No specific exclusions are identified with this state.
- **Minimalist Costumes**: If observed, Greek Tragedy can be ruled out, as it typically involves more elaborate presentations.

### 3. Emotional Tone Assessment
Understanding the emotional tone is key to identifying the genre:
- **Consistently Serious**: No specific exclusions are identified with this state.
- **Varied Emotional Tones**: If this outcome is observed, Tragicomedy should be ruled out, as it is known for its richness in emotional variety.

### 4. Tone Consistency Check
Determining the consistency in tone is vital:
- **Consistent Tone**: Should this outcome be identified, Tragicomedy can be excluded, which typically alternates between comedic and serious tones.
- **Shifts in Tone**: No specific exclusions are identified with this state.

### 5. Theme Assessment
Themes reveal the core of a playâ€™s message:
- **Serious and Philosophical Themes**: If this feature is prominent, Vaudeville can be considered improbable, as it generally offers light-hearted entertainment.
- **Light-hearted and Entertaining Themes**: No genres are specifically excluded with this state.

### 6. Length and Structure Analysis
The duration and structure of a play can limit potential genre classifications:
- **Length (0-60 minutes)**: Observing this length can rule out Tragicomedy, typically requiring longer forms to fully develop its mixed themes.
- **Length (61-120 minutes)**: No specific exclusions are identified with this state.

## Conclusion
This guidebook provides a comprehensive framework for identifying and narrowing down potential theatrical genres through meticulous script analysis. By systematically observing and noting these specific states and their resultant exclusions, practitioners can refine their understanding of a play's true genre, ensuring a richer, more informed performance interpretation.
