## **Theatrical Script Analysis Guidebook**

This guidebook is designed to assist you in analyzing theatrical scripts by introducing key genres and essential analytical activities. Each activity is aimed at helping you understand the nuances of the script and ruling out certain theatrical genres based on specific outcomes.

### Theatrical Genres

1. **Mystery Play**: Originating from Medieval Europe, mystery plays depict biblical stories and are often performed during religious festivals. These plays typically have a religious theme and were historically part of cycles.

2. **Farce**: A light, comedic genre featuring exaggerated and improbable events intended for humorous effect. Farces often involve physical humor and extreme situations.

3. **Absurdist Drama**: A genre that expresses the belief that human existence is purposeless. These plays typically present illogical, senseless events that challenge conventional narrative structures and dialogue.

4. **Opera**: A dramatic work where the script, known as the libretto, is predominantly set to music. Operas typically involve a combination of singing in various styles and orchestral accompaniment.
