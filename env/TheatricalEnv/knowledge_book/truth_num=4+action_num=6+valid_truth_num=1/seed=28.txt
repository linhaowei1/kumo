# Theatrical Script Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a framework for analyzing theatrical scripts within various genres. It includes a detailed look at analysis activities essential for understanding the intricacies of different types of plays, with a focus on ruling out specific genres based on the observed outcomes of these analyses.

## Theatrical Genres Overview

1. **Lyric Drama**: A genre that often intertwines poetry with action, creating an emotional and reflective experience. Characters often express deeper emotional truths through lyrical and poetic dialogues.

2. **Comedy**: Characterized by humor, wit, and often a happy ending, comedy explores human folly and social norms. It usually features conflicts resolved in amusing and ironic ways.

3. **Musical Theatre**: A genre that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting, and dance. Character dialogues tend to be concise, often leading into songs or performances to further the plot.

4. **Realism**: Aims to represent life accurately, focusing on everyday activities and authentic dialogues. It often involves detailed settings and explores complex characters and situations.

## Script Analysis Activities

This involves examining the nature and style of the dialogue between characters.

- **Highly Poetic**: Rule out "Realism" as this often requires more authentic and realistic dialogues.
- **Colloquial**: When observed, can apply to any genre.
- **Minimalist**: Rule out "Musical Theatre" because musical theatre dialogues are often brief to make way for songs, but the dialogues themselves are crucial.

### 2. Linguistic Style Analysis
Focuses on the language used in the script, whether it is everyday language or more refined.

- **Colloquial Language**: Rule out "Lyric Drama" as this genre prefers elevated or poetic language.

### 3. Stage Directions Analysis
Examines the specificity and amount of stage directions provided in the script.

- **Detailed Stage Directions**: Can apply to any genre.
- **Minimal Stage Directions**: Rule out "Realism", as this typically includes extensive and precise stage directions.

### 4. Conflict Type Identification
Identifies the primary type of conflict driving the narrative.

- **Man vs. Self**: Rule out "Comedy", as comedies often deal with external conflicts or social interactions rather than internal struggles.
- **Man vs. Society**: Can apply to any genre.
- **Man vs. Nature**: Can apply to any genre.

### 5. Symbolism Analysis
Analyzes the use and significance of symbolism within the script.

- **Heavy Symbolism**: Rule out "Realism", where the focus is more on the mundane and literal representation of life.
- **Minimal Symbolism**: Can apply to any genre.

### 6. Plot Complexity Analysis
Evaluates the intricacy of the plot structure and story progression.

- **Complexity Rated 0-5**: Can apply to any genre.
