# Theatrical Script Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

Analyzing a theatrical script involves understanding various components that bring a play from page to stage. This guidebook provides a detailed examination of four distinct theatrical genres and prescribed script analysis activities. We will explore how different outcomes in script analysis can help identify or exclude certain genres from consideration. This understanding enhances the ability to interpret, perform, or critique theatrical works meaningfully.
