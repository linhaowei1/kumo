## **Theatrical Script Analysis Guidebook**

This guidebook is designed to aid in the analysis of theatrical scripts by providing an understanding of various theatrical genres and outlining specific script analysis activities. Each activity provides outcomes that can help in determining what genre the script is not associated with based on observed characteristics.

## Theatrical Genres

### Satyr Play
A lighthearted and often comedic genre originating from ancient Greek theater, known for its chorus of satyrs providing bawdy humor and parody. 

### Thriller
A genre characterized by suspense, tension, and excitement. Thrillers often include intricate plots and strong social commentary that engage the audience.

### Epic Theatre
Popularized by Bertolt Brecht, this genre is designed to provoke rational self-reflection and a critical view of the actions on the stage. It often breaks the "fourth wall" and includes non-linear plot structures and present temporal settings.

### Shakespearean
A genre encompassing the works of William Shakespeare, known for its poetic language, use of soliloquies, and wide range of themes from tragedy to comedy.

## Script Analysis Activities

### 1. Plot Structure Examination
This activity evaluates the organization of the script's events.
- **Non-linear** plots mean none of the identified genres can be ruled out specifically.
- **Linear** plots exclude Epic Theatre as they typically employ non-linear storytelling.

### 2. Chorus Inclusion Check
This activity assesses the presence or absence of a chorus in the script.
- If a **chorus is present**, no specific genres can be ruled out.
- **No chorus** eliminates Satyr Play, as it typically features a chorus of satyrs.

### 3. Presence of Soliloquy Check
This examines whether characters express their inner thoughts out loud, typically alone on stage.
- Scripts with **frequent soliloquies** do not exclude any specific genres.
- **No soliloquies** is an indicator to rule out Shakespearean genre, which frequently employs this device.

### 4. Social Commentary Presence Check
This activity reviews the script for any underlying messages about society.
- **Strong social commentary** eliminates Thriller, as they inherently contain this element.
- **No social commentary** doesn't exclude any specific genres uniquely; rather, it reassures others not to be ruled out.

### 5. Plot Complexity Analysis
This involves evaluating the intricacy and depth of the scriptâ€™s plot.
- A complexity score of **0 to 5** suggests ruling out Thriller, which typically has more complex plots.
- **Complexity beyond 5** doesn't immediately exclude any genres, meaning further analysis is needed to rule out others.

### 6. Temporal Setting Examination
This looks at the time period in which the script is set.
- A script set in the **present** eliminates Epic Theatre, which often engages with this temporal setting.
- **Past** and **future** do not distinctly exclude any genres but indicate areas to focus on during further analysis.

By employing these analysis activities, you can determine what a script is not, thus narrowing down the possibilities for accurate genre classification. Understanding these exclusions will help you focus on the defining characteristics or thematic content specific to particular genres.
