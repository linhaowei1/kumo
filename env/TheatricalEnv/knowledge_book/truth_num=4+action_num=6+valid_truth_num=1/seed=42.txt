# Theatrical Script Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to help you navigate the task of theatrical script analysis by introducing several genres and a series of analysis activities to perform on scripts. For each activity, specific outcomes will help you exclude certain genres based on your findings.

## Theatrical Genres

### 1. Lyric Drama
- **Description**: This genre often focuses on the poetic and musical aspects of storytelling. It tends to emphasize emotions, moods, and a lyrical quality of expression. Expect harmonious dialogue that may be more akin to music or poetry than regular speech.

### 2. Shakespearean
- **Description**: Rooted in the works of William Shakespeare, this genre is characterized by its use of iambic pentameter, soliloquy, and a mix of verse and prose. It often covers themes of human nature, power struggles, and tragic flaws.

### 3. Existentialist Drama
- **Description**: Existentialist drama grapples with themes of meaninglessness, free will, and the absurdity of human existence. Characters in these plays often face moral choices without clear right or wrong answers.
  
### 4. Historical
- **Description**: Historical drama reflects events and characters from the past, often focusing on political, social, or cultural themes from a specific era. This genre aims to bring historical narratives to life on stage.
