# Economic Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of various economic models and policy simulations, with a focus on identifying which models can be ruled out when observing specific outcomes. The economic models covered include Monopoly Theory, Permanent Income Hypothesis, Monetarism, and New Keynesian Economics. The policy simulations analyzed address impacts on inflation, savings rates, market competition, interest rates, GDP growth, and fiscal multipliers.

## Economic Models Overview

### 1. Monopoly Theory
Monopoly Theory examines market situations where a single firm dominates, acting as the sole producer of a good or service with no close substitutes. This model helps understand pricing power, barriers to entry, and the inefficiencies that can arise from lack of competition.

### 2. Permanent Income Hypothesis
The Permanent Income Hypothesis, proposed by Milton Friedman, suggests that individuals base their consumption decisions on their expected long-term average income rather than current income. It implies that temporary changes in income do not significantly affect consumer spending patterns.

### 3. Monetarism
Monetarism emphasizes the role of governments in controlling the amount of money in circulation. Monetarists assert that variations in the money supply have major influences on national output and inflation levels, advocating for predictable monetary policy to manage economic stability.

### 4. New Keynesian Economics
New Keynesian Economics builds upon traditional Keynesian concepts by incorporating microeconomic foundations to explain price stickiness and how market imperfections can lead to macroeconomic instability. This model often supports active government policies to address economic fluctuations.

## Policy Simulations and Outcomes

### Analyze Impact on Inflation
- **(5.0, 20.0):** Rule out New Keynesian Economics.
- **(2.0, 5.0):** Rule out Monetarism.
- **(0.0, 2.0):** No models are ruled out.

### Examine Savings Rates
- **(0.0, 5.0):** No models are ruled out.
- **(5.0, 15.0):** No models are ruled out.
- **(15.0, 30.0):** Rule out Monetarism.

### Analyze Market Competition
- **Perfect Competition:** Rule out Monopoly Theory.
- **Monopolistic Competition:** No models are ruled out.

### Study Effects on Interest Rates
- **(0.0, 2.0):** Rule out Monetarism.
- **(2.0, 5.0):** No models are ruled out.
- **(5.0, 10.0):** Rule out New Keynesian Economics.

### Investigate Changes in GDP Growth
- **(5.0, 10.0):** No models are ruled out.
- **(0.0, 5.0):** No models are ruled out.
- **(-10.0, 0.0):** Rule out Monetarism.

### Evaluate Fiscal Multipliers
- **(1.5, 3.0):** Rule out Monetarism.
- **(0.5, 1.5):** No models are ruled out.
- **(-1.0, 0.5):** No models are ruled out.

## Understanding and Applying the Guide

This guide uses the rule-out method to interpret the relevance of economic models in specific contexts based on observed outcomes. By understanding which models can be excluded under certain conditions, analysts can refine their analysis and tailor economic policies to better suit observed data.

Each policy simulation ideally provides a framework against which the strengths or limitations of various models can be assessed. This allows policymakers and economists to strategically eliminate implausible theories, thereby narrowing their focus to the most applicable models for addressing real-world economic challenges.
