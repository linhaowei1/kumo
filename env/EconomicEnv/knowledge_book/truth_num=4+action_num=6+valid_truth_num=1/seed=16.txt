# Economic Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook serves as an introduction to key economic models and policy simulations, providing a simple approach to understanding how various theoretical approaches can be applied to real-world economic analysis. We focus on four economic models and the simulation of six policy scenarios, explaining how observations in these simulations impact the applicability of each model. The results of our simulations are used not to confirm which models are at play, but to rule out models that are inconsistent with observed outcomes.

## Economic Models

1. **Behavioral Economics**
   - This model examines economic decision-making influenced by psychological factors. People often do not act entirely rationally; instead, they follow patterns or biases that deviate from classical economic predictions.

2. **Austrian School**
   - The Austrian School emphasizes the importance of individual choices and actions over time, capital structure, and the role of entrepreneurship. It often critiques the reliability of mathematical modeling in economics.

3. **Rational Expectations Theory**
   - According to this theory, people form expectations about the future based on available information, and thus, generally, predictions align with actual future outcomes barring any new information that could disrupt expectations.

4. **Life-Cycle Hypothesis**
   - This model suggests individuals plan their consumption and savings behavior over their lifetime, aiming for a stable consumption level by accumulating wealth during working years for retirement.

## Policy Simulations

Here, we outline how different policy simulations might impact economic outcomes and the applicability of various models.

### 1. Analyze Impact on Inflation
- **(5.0, 20.0) Inflation Rate**: If inflation is high (between 5.0 and 20.0), exclude "Behavioral Economics" and "Rational Expectations Theory".
- **(2.0, 5.0) Inflation Rate**: At moderate inflation (between 2.0 and 5.0), rule out the "Austrian School".
- **(0.0, 2.0) Inflation Rate**: No specific models are excluded with low inflation.

### 2. Assess Consumption Patterns
- **High Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)**: A high propensity to consume rules out "Rational Expectations Theory" and "Life-Cycle Hypothesis".
- **Low MPC**: When consumption propensity is low, "Behavioral Economics" is ruled out.

### 3. Assess Investment Levels
- **(0.0, 5.0) Investment Level**: Low investment levels lead us to exclude "Austrian School".
- **(5.0, 15.0) Investment Level**: There are no model exclusions for moderate investment levels here.
- **(15.0, 30.0) Investment Level**: High investment levels do not rule out any specific models.

### 4. Examine Savings Rates
- **(0.0, 5.0) Savings Rate**: At low savings rates, no models are deemed invalid.
- **(5.0, 15.0) Savings Rate**: Moderate savings rates also do not exclude any models.
- **(15.0, 30.0) Savings Rate**: High savings rates indicate the exclusion of "Austrian School".

### 5. Analyze Financial Market Stability
- **Instability**: No models are specifically disregarded when markets are unstable.
- **Stability**: A stable financial market environment suggests ruling out "Behavioral Economics".

### 6. Study Effects on Interest Rates
- **(0.0, 2.0) Interest Rates**: Low rates do not necessitate the exclusion of any models.
- **(2.0, 5.0) Interest Rates**: Similar to low rates, moderate rates do not provide exclusions.
- **(5.0, 10.0) Interest Rates**: When rates are high, "Austrian School" is ruled out.

This guide provides a foundational understanding of how different economic models relate to observable economic outcomes. By using simulations, analysts can rule out models inconsistent with current economic data, thus focusing on more applicable theories for understanding economic conditions.
