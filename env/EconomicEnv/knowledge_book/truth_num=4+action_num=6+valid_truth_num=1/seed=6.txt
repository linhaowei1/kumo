# Economic Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook is designed to offer a fundamental understanding of various economic models and how specific policy simulations can inform decisions by ruling out certain models. The focus here is on four primary economic theories—New Keynesian Economics, Monopoly Theory, Austrian School, and Keynesian Economics—and how the outcomes of key policy simulations can eliminate potential models. By understanding these dynamics, stakeholders can better navigate economic decision-making. 

## Economic Models

### 1. New Keynesian Economics
New Keynesian Economics builds on the ideas of Keynesian Economics, incorporating aspects like price stickiness and wage rigidity. It highlights the need for monetary policy to manage economic fluctuations and offers insights into how inflation expectations and demand can affect an economy.

### 2. Monopoly Theory
Monopoly Theory examines the dynamics of markets dominated by a single seller. This model analyzes how monopolies set prices, control supply, and impact market efficiency by limiting competition. It provides a framework for understanding market power and its implications for consumer choice and economic welfare.

### 3. Austrian School
The Austrian School emphasizes the role of individual action and the importance of time and information in economic decisions. It critiques centralized economic planning and supports free markets, focusing on entrepreneurship and the dynamic nature of market activities.

### 4. Keynesian Economics
Keynesian Economics, originating with John Maynard Keynes, stresses the role of aggregate demand in driving economic performance, particularly during periods of recession. It advocates for active government intervention and fiscal policies to stabilize economies and promote growth.

## Policy Simulations and Outcomes

### Assess Investment Levels
This simulation involves evaluating the rate of investment within an economy:

- **Outcome: (0.0, 5.0)** 
  - **Ruled Out Models:** Austrian School
- **Outcome: (5.0, 15.0)**
  - **Ruled Out Models:** Keynesian Economics
- **Outcome: (15.0, 30.0)**
  - No models are ruled out for this range.

### Analyze Market Competition
This simulation examines the types of competition within the market:

- **Outcome: Perfect Competition**
  - **Ruled Out Models:** Monopoly Theory
- **Outcome: Monopolistic Competition**
  - No models are ruled out for this type of competition.

### Examine Monopoly Power
This simulation explores the concentration of market power:

- **Outcome: High Concentration**
  - No models are ruled out for high concentration scenarios.
- **Outcome: Low Concentration**
  - **Ruled Out Models:** Keynesian Economics

### Analyze Impact on Inflation
This simulation assesses economic responses to various inflation levels:

- **Outcome: (5.0, 20.0)**
  - **Ruled Out Models:** New Keynesian Economics
- **Outcome: (2.0, 5.0)**
  - **Ruled Out Models:** Austrian School
- **Outcome: (0.0, 2.0)**
  - **Ruled Out Models:** Keynesian Economics

### Examine Price Elasticity of Demand
This simulation considers how demand respond to price changes:

- **Outcome: (0.0, 1.0)**
  - No models are ruled out for this range of elasticity.
- **Outcome: (1.0, 10.0)**
  - **Ruled Out Models:** Keynesian Economics

### Evaluate Tax Policy Effects
This simulation evaluates different tax structures and their effects:

- **Outcome: Laffer Curve Peak**
  - No models are ruled out under the peak of the Laffer curve.
- **Outcome: Progressive Impact**
  - **Ruled Out Models:** Keynesian Economics

## Conclusion

By understanding these economic models and simulating these critical economic policies, policymakers and analysts can better identify which theories are less applicable under certain conditions. This approach streamlines economic analysis, focusing on a process of elimination to refine strategies and policies in pursuit of economic stability and growth.
