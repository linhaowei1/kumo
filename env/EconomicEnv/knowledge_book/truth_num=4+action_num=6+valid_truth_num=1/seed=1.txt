# Economic Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Economic Analysis Guidebook, your comprehensive resource for understanding various economic models and their implications through policy simulations. This guide will introduce several foundational economic theories and will provide detailed analyses of policy simulations to determine which models are not supported by observed outcomes. By applying this systematic approach, you can gain a clearer picture of how different economic theories can be evaluated through real-world phenomena.

## Economic Models

### 1. Neoclassical Economics
- **Overview:** Focuses on how the equilibrium of supply and demand determines prices and quantities in markets. Assumes rational decision-making and the optimization of utility and profit by consumers and firms, respectively.
- **Core Concepts:** Market equilibrium, marginalism, and opportunity costs.

### 2. New Keynesian Economics
- **Overview:** Builds upon Keynesian economics by incorporating microeconomic foundations to explain price stickiness and its impact on the economy. Emphasizes the role of monetary policy in managing economic fluctuations.
- **Core Concepts:** Price rigidities, nominal wages, and the significance of policy interventions.

### 3. Monopoly Theory
- **Overview:** Examines market structures where a single firm dominates, affecting competition and market dynamics. Analyzes the impact on pricing, output, and consumer choice.
- **Core Concepts:** Barriers to entry, pricing power, and efficiency loss.

### 4. Keynesian Economics
- **Overview:** Highlights the role of aggregate demand in influencing economic output and employment, particularly in the short run. Advocates for government intervention to stabilize economic fluctuations.
- **Core Concepts:** Fiscal policy, demand management, and cyclical unemployment.

## Policy Simulations and Outcomes

This section discusses policy simulations used to assess the impact of different economic phenomena, highlighting which models are ruled out when specific outcomes are observed.

### 1. Analyze Impact on Inflation
When simulating inflation impacts, observed inflation rates indicate which models may not apply:
- For inflation rates between 5.0% and 20.0%, **New Keynesian Economics** is ruled out.
- For inflation rates between 0.0% and 2.0%, **Keynesian Economics** is ruled out.
- No models are ruled out for inflation rates between 2.0% and 5.0%.

### 2. Analyze Market Competition
This simulation assesses market structures:
- In cases of **Perfect competition**, **Monopoly Theory** is ruled out, as a monopoly does not fit this structure.
- No models are ruled out in scenarios of **Monopolistic competition**.

### 3. Analyze Business Cycle Fluctuations
This simulation evaluates patterns in economic cycles:
- When observing **Smoothed cycles**, **Keynesian Economics** is ruled out.
- No models are ruled out for **Frequent cycles**.

### 4. Evaluate Capital Flows
This simulation observes capital movement across borders:
- With capital flows between -100.0 and -1.0, **Keynesian Economics** is ruled out.
- No models are ruled out for flows between -1.0 and 1.0 or between 1.0 and 100.0.

### 5. Investigate Impact on Poverty Levels
This simulation examines changes in poverty:
- For poverty reductions between 10.0% and 100.0%, **Keynesian Economics** is ruled out.
- No models are ruled out for changes between 0.0% and 10.0%.

### 6. Examine Savings Rates
This simulation explores the effects on savings behavior:
- With savings rate changes between 5.0% and 15.0%, **Keynesian Economics** is ruled out.
- No models are ruled out for changes between 0.0% and 5.0% or 15.0% and 30.0%.

## Conclusion

Through the analysis of these models and simulations, we can better understand how different economic theories align or misalign with observable outcomes. By ruling out incompatible models based on specific evidence, we contribute to the evolving discourse on economic theory and policymaking. Use this guidebook as a reference to support your exploration and analysis of economic dynamics.
