# Economic Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an introduction to various economic models and explores how specific policy simulations can be used to better understand economic outcomes. By examining each model and simulation, we aim to help policymakers and economists make informed decisions by identifying which economic frameworks may not be applicable given certain observed outcomes.

## Economic Models

### 1. Ecological Economics
Ecological Economics focuses on the relationship between economic systems and the ecological environment, emphasizing sustainability and the long-term impacts of economic growth on natural resources.

### 2. Monopoly Theory
Monopoly Theory examines markets where a single firm or entity has significant control, evaluating how this dominance affects prices, competition, and efficiency within a market.

### 3. Behavioral Economics
Behavioral Economics studies the psychological factors influencing economic decisions, highlighting how cognitive biases and social factors shape consumer behavior and market outcomes.

### 4. Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)
Modern Monetary Theory posits that countries that issue their own currencies can manage economy-wide spending without necessarily adhering to traditional budget constraints, suggesting unique perspectives on public debt and government spending.

## Policy Simulations and Outcomes

### 1. Investigate Public Debt Sustainability
- **Outcome: Public Debt Level (80.0 - 200.0% of GDP)**
  - **Rule-out:** No economic models ruled out.
- **Outcome: Public Debt Level (0.0 - 80.0% of GDP)**
  - **Rule-out:** Modern Monetary Theory is ruled out when public debt is within this range.

### 2. Assess Environmental Impacts
- **Outcome: Negative Externalities**
  - **Rule-out:** No economic models ruled out.
- **Outcome: Sustainable Development**
  - **Rule-out:** Ecological Economics is ruled out when sustainable development is observed.

### 3. Analyze Market Competition
- **Outcome: Perfect Competition**
  - **Rule-out:** Monopoly Theory is ruled out in perfectly competitive markets.
- **Outcome: Monopolistic Competition**
  - **Rule-out:** No economic models ruled out.

### 4. Analyze Impact on Inflation
- **Outcome: High Inflation Rates (5.0 - 20.0%)**
  - **Rule-out:** Behavioral Economics is ruled out when inflation rates are high.
- **Outcome: Moderate Inflation Rates (2.0 - 5.0%)**
  - **Rule-out:** No economic models ruled out.
- **Outcome: Low Inflation Rates (0.0 - 2.0%)**
  - **Rule-out:** No economic models ruled out.

### 5. Assess Consumption Patterns
- **Outcome: High Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)**
  - **Rule-out:** No economic models ruled out.
- **Outcome: Low Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)**
  - **Rule-out:** Behavioral Economics is ruled out when the MPC is low.

### 6. Analyze Financial Market Stability
- **Outcome: Instability**
  - **Rule-out:** No economic models ruled out.
- **Outcome: Stability**
  - **Rule-out:** Behavioral Economics is ruled out when financial markets are stable.

## Conclusion

By using this guidebook, analysts and decision-makers can better understand the applicability of various economic models based on observed outcomes from policy simulations. Each policy simulation provides insights that can help rule out certain economic models, allowing for a more targeted and accurate assessment of economic conditions and decisions.
