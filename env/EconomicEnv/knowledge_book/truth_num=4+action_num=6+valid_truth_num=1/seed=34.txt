# Economic Analysis Guidebook: Understanding Models and Policy Simulations

This guidebook aims to introduce key economic models and policy simulations in a straightforward manner. We focus on four economic models and use policy simulations to explore related outcomes. An important aspect of this guide is understanding which economic models can be ruled out based on observed outcomes in policy simulations.

## Economic Models

### Post-Keynesian Economics
Post-Keynesian Economics emphasizes the role of demand in the economy and believes that output and employment are primarily determined by demand. It often criticizes neoclassical economics for neglecting the importance of uncertainty and institutional factors.

### Behavioral Economics
Behavioral Economics integrates insights from psychology into economics, focusing on how people often behave in ways that deviate from traditional economic models focusing on rational behavior. This field examines how factors such as emotions and cognitive biases influence economic decisions.

### New Keynesian Economics
New Keynesian Economics builds on Keynesian principles, incorporating microeconomic foundations and emphasizing price stickiness and imperfect competition. It often uses models where prices and wages do not adjust instantly to changes in economic conditions.

### Mercantilism
Mercantilism is an economic theory historically focused on promoting governmental regulation to achieve a positive trade balance. This theory suggests that national strength can be maximized by minimizing imports and maximizing exports.

## Policy Simulations and Outcomes

### 1. Examine Unemployment Trends
This simulation evaluates how unemployment levels change under different conditions. The outcomes are interpreted to rule out economic models based on the observed trends:
- If unemployment rate change is between 0.1% and 10.0%, Post-Keynesian Economics is ruled out.

### 2. Study Effects on Interest Rates
This simulation assesses how interest rate fluctuations influence the economy. Outcomes dictate the exclusion of certain models:
- If interest rates rise between 5.0% and 10.0%, New Keynesian Economics is ruled out.

### 3. Study Trade Balance Changes
This simulation investigates how different conditions affect the trade balance:
- If the trade balance changes between 1.0% and 10.0%, Mercantilism is ruled out.

### 4. Analyze Impact on Inflation
This evaluation looks at how inflation rates behave under varied circumstances:
- If inflation rates increase between 5.0% and 20.0%, New Keynesian Economics and Behavioral Economics are ruled out.

### 5. Assess Consumption Patterns
This simulation focuses on the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and its impacts:
- If a low MPC is observed, Behavioral Economics is ruled out.

### 6. Evaluate Fiscal Multipliers
This simulation studies the impact of fiscal policy on the economy:
- If the fiscal multiplier is between -1.0 and 0.5, Post-Keynesian Economics is ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guidebook outlines key economic models and their relevance to policy simulations. By examining specific outcomes, analysts can systematically rule out certain economic models, thereby refining their understanding of economic dynamics and informing policy decisions. Each simulation and accompanying interpretation are designed to enhance clarity and improve decision-making in real-world economic analysis.
