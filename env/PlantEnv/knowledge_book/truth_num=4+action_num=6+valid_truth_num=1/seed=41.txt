# Botanical Guidebook: Examination of Selected Plant Species

This guidebook introduces four plant species and various methods for examining them. The goal is to help you identify which species may be excluded based on specific examination outcomes. The plants discussed are *Platanus occidentalis* (American sycamore), *Populus deltoides* (Eastern cottonwood), *Tsuga canadensis* (Eastern hemlock), and *Fraxinus excelsior* (Common ash).

## Plant Species

1. **Platanus occidentalis (American sycamore)**
   - Known for its distinctive peeling bark and large size.
   - Often found in floodplain environments.

2. **Populus deltoides (Eastern cottonwood)**
   - Recognizable by its triangular leaves and rapid growth.
   - Typically grows in floodplains.

3. **Tsuga canadensis (Eastern hemlock)**
   - Features needle-like foliage and a slower growth rate.
   - Adaptable to a variety of forested habitats.

4. **Fraxinus excelsior (Common ash)**
   - Bears simple leaves and is widely distributed in temperate regions.
   - Typically found in mixed woodland environments.

## Examination Methods and Exclusion Outcomes

### 1. Habitat Analysis
This method helps narrow down species based on their preferred environments. In particular:

- **Floodplains:** If your study area is not a floodplain, you can likely exclude *Populus deltoides* and *Platanus occidentalis* as they are typically associated with this habitat.

### 2. Growth Rate Measurement
Assess the annual growth increments of the plant:

- **0 - 0.5 meters/year:** If the observed growth falls in this range, *Tsuga canadensis* can be potentially ruled out, as it characteristically grows more slowly than the others.

### 3. Leaf Morphology Examination
Examining the type and arrangement of leaves helps in identification:

- **Simple leaves:** If the plant does not have simple leaves, *Fraxinus excelsior* could be excluded from consideration.

### 4. Bark Texture Analysis
This involves feeling and observing the bark texture:

- **Peeling bark:** If the bark of the specimen peels, *Platanus occidentalis* can be excluded as a possible species.

### 5. Flowering Time Observation
This method requires studying the period when a plant flowers:

- **Months 0-3, 4-6, 7-9:** The absence of observable flowering during any of these times does not specifically rule out any of the plants in this guide.

### 6. Fruit Type Identification
Identifying fruit types contributes to determining species presence:

- **Samara, Nut, Berry:** None of the species will be ruled out by the absence of these specific fruit types.

## Conclusion

By using these methods, you can systematically exclude certain species from your study, narrowing down the possibilities based on observable traits and conditions. Remember, these exclusion rules are tools to guide your native or horticultural assessments. By focusing on what characteristics do not match the species, you can make more informed decisions in plant identification and ecology studies.
