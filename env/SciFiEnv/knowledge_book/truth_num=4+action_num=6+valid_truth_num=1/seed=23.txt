# Guidebook for Determining if a Planet Supports Life in a Sci-Fi Setting

Welcome, interstellar explorers, to the guide for determining the potential of life-supporting conditions on planets in the uncharted realms of our galaxy. In this guide, we will explore a series of scans and analytical methods used to assess the viability of life on four distinctive planets: Helios, Elysium, Zephyria, and Eden Prime. Through a comprehensive understanding of these evaluations, you'll be able to identify which planets fall short in supporting life, thereby narrowing down your quest for celestial habitable worlds.

## Overview of Planets
1. **Helios**: Known for its blazing proximity to its star, Helios has unique characteristics ripe for scientific exploration.
2. **Elysium**: A planet with a mystic allure, Elysium presents intriguing atmospheric conditions that merit investigation.
3. **Zephyria**: Defined by its wild and unpredictable atmospheric dynamics, Zephyria is a planet full of surprises.
4. **Eden Prime**: Often seen as a hopeful candidate for life, Eden Prime's natural features foster much curiosity.

## Scans and Samples

Each scan or sample provides specific insights into the properties of a planet, allowing us to rule out planets based on their outcomes:

### 1. Atmospheric Composition Analysis
This scan determines the dominant gases in a planet's atmosphere, helping to assess its ability to support life.

- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: No planets ruled out.
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**:
  - Rule Out: **Zephyria, Eden Prime**
  
- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: No planets ruled out.
- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**:
  - Rule Out: **Zephyria, Elysium**

### 2. Oxygen Level Test
This test measures the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere, crucial for assessing habitability.

- **0 - 10% Oxygen**: No planets ruled out.
- **10 - 20% Oxygen**: No planets ruled out.
- **20 - 30% Oxygen**: No planets ruled out.
- **30 - 100% Oxygen**:
  - Rule Out: **Helios**

### 3. Magnetic Field Assessment
A planet's magnetic field protects it from harmful solar radiation, influencing its capacity to sustain life.

- **Strong Magnetic Field**: No planets ruled out.
- **Weak Magnetic Field**:
  - Rule Out: **Zephyria**

- **No Detectable Magnetic Field**: No planets ruled out.

### 4. Liquid Water Detection
The presence of liquid water is a key indicator of a planet's potential to support life.

- **Liquid Water Present**: No planets ruled out.
- **No Liquid Water Detected**:
  - Rule Out: **Zephyria, Elysium**

### 5. Solar Radiation Absorption Test
This test measures a planet's ability to absorb solar radiation, affecting its thermal regulation.

- **High Absorption**: No planets ruled out.
- **Moderate Absorption**: No planets ruled out.
- **Low Absorption**: No planets ruled out.

### 6. Presence of Organic Molecules Test
Detecting organic molecules can suggest the possibility of life-forming processes.

- **Organic Molecules Present**: No planets ruled out.
- **No Organic Molecules Detected**: No planets ruled out.

## Conclusion

By carefully analyzing the outcomes of each scan, explorers can systematically eliminate planets that do not meet the criteria for potential life-supporting conditions. While no single scan can confirm the presence of life, each provides critical data to build a comprehensive assessment. Thus, this guide serves as an essential tool in directing your focus toward worlds that may harbor life, steering clear of those that cannot meet the basic requirements for life as we envision it. Happy exploring, and let the stars guide your path!
