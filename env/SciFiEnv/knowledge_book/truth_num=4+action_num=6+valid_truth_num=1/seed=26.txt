# Guidebook: Determining Planet Habitability in a Sci-Fi Universe

This guide provides an analysis process for evaluating the potential of various fictional planets to support life. By employing a series of scientific scans and tests, we can methodically "rule out" planets that do not meet the necessary conditions for supporting life. The planets under investigation are **Hyperion**, **Eden Prime**, **Umbra**, and **Vulcania**. However, this guide primarily encompasses planets that are affected by the outcomes of various tests, which are listed here.

## Planets Overview

1. **Hyperion**: A planet known for its enigmatic landscapes and considered a candidate for harboring life forms that could adapt to unusual atmospheric compositions.
2. **Eden Prime**: Though not part of the exclusion outcomes, this planet is hypothetically lush, with a balanced ecosystem, making it a top candidate for supporting diverse life forms.
3. **Umbra**: Shrouded in mystery, known for its peculiar absence of a magnetic field and unique geological features, though less likely to support life as we understand it.
4. **Vulcania**: A tumultuous world with intense seismic activity and limited oxygen levels, often deemed inhospitable.

## Scans and Samples

### 1. Gravitational Field Strength Test

- **Purpose**: Measures the gravitational pull of the planet, which affects the ability to sustain life.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **(0.0, 0.5)**: Excludes **Hyperion, Umbra**
  - **(0.5, 1.5)**: No exclusions
  - **(1.5, 3.0)**: Excludes **Vulcania**
  - **(3.0, 10.0)**: Excludes **Vulcania**

### 2. Magnetic Pole Reversal History

- **Purpose**: Assesses the stability of the planet's magnetic field, crucial for protecting life from harmful solar radiation.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Recent Pole Reversal**: Excludes **Vulcania**
  - **Stable Poles**: No exclusions
  - **No Magnetic Field**: Excludes **Umbra**

### 3. Ice Core Sampling

- **Purpose**: Detects the presence of ice, indicative of waterâ€”a basic necessity for life.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Ice Present**: No exclusions
  - **No Ice Detected**: Excludes **Vulcania**

### 4. Oxygen Level Test

- **Purpose**: Estimates the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere, essential for life similar to Earth's.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **(0, 10)**: Excludes **Vulcania**
  - **(10, 20)**: No exclusions
  - **(20, 30)**: No exclusions
  - **(30, 100)**: No exclusions

### 5. Average Rainfall Measurement

- **Purpose**: Evaluates the average rainfall, providing insight into the planet's ability to maintain life-supporting water cycles.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **(0, 10)**: Excludes **Vulcania**
  - **(10, 200)**: No exclusions
  - **(200, 1000)**: No exclusions

### 6. Seismic Activity Monitoring

- **Purpose**: Analyzes geological activity levels, as extreme conditions can hinder stable life development.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **High Seismic Activity**: Excludes **Vulcania**
  - **Low Seismic Activity**: No exclusions
  - **No Seismic Activity**: Excludes **Umbra**

## Conclusion

By utilizing these tests and understanding the outcomes, researchers can systematically determine which planets are less likely to support life. The exclusion method outlined ensures a clear approach, ruling out planets based on established criteria from scientific observations. Planets not mentioned in any exclusion outcomes, like **Eden Prime**, remain potential candidates for supporting life.
