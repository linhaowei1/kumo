# Guidebook for Determining Life-Support on Sci-Fi Planets

## Introduction

In the quest to explore the universe and discover new life-supporting planets, scientists have developed a series of scans and analyses to guide these assessments. In this guide, we will explore how to determine if the planets Mirage, Elysium, Solaris, and Helios can support life using specific scientific evaluations. The scans produce outcomes that help rule out planets that are unsuitable for sustaining life, thereby narrowing down potential candidates.

## Planet Profiles

1. **Mirage**: The characteristics of this planet remain mysterious. It is essential to evaluate it thoroughly using available scans to determine its potential to support life.

2. **Elysium**: Known for some unique atmospheric qualities, it shows intriguing elements that warrant further investigation.

3. **Solaris**: A dynamic world with complex attributes, including volcanic activity and a methane-rich atmosphere.

4. **Helios**: Named for its bright characteristics, Helios has an atmosphere rich in oxygen.

## Scans and Their Interpretations

### 1. Atmospheric Composition Analysis

This scan determines the dominant gases present in the atmosphere. Specific atmospheric compositions can rule out planets:

- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: Excludes Solaris.
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Does not exclude any listed planet.
- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: Excludes Solaris.
- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Excludes Elysium.

### 2. Oxygen Level Test

This test measures oxygen levels, crucial for many life forms:

- **0-10% Oxygen**: Excludes Solaris.
- **10-20% Oxygen**: Excludes no planets.
- **20-30% Oxygen**: Excludes no planets.
- **30-100% Oxygen**: Excludes Helios.

### 3. Volcanic Activity Assessment

This assessment identifies volcanic activity that might impact atmospheric conditions and surface stability:

- **Active Volcanoes**: Excludes Solaris.
- **No Volcanic Activity**: No exclusions.

### 4. Subsurface Ocean Detection

The presence of subsurface water is a critical factor for life:

- **Subsurface Ocean Present**: Does not exclude any listed planet.
- **No Subsurface Ocean**: Excludes Solaris.

### 5. Planetary Albedo Measurement

Albedo reflects the amount of light that reflects off the planet's surface, which can affect climate conditions:

- **0.0-0.3 Albedo**: Excludes Solaris.
- **0.3-0.7 Albedo**: No exclusions.
- **0.7-1.0 Albedo**: No exclusions.

### 6. Presence of Organic Molecules Test

Organic compounds are key indicators of potential biological activity:

- **Organic Molecules Present**: No exclusions.
- **No Organic Molecules Detected**: Excludes Solaris.

## Conclusion

In this sci-fi setting, comprehensive use of the scans outlined above helps systematically assess the life-supporting potential of each planet by ruling out planets based on non-compatible observations. While the absence of exclusions for a planet does not necessarily prove it supports life, it remains a candidate for further exploration. By following the interpretation of scan outcomes, we progress closer to discovering worlds that may harbor life.
