# Guidebook for Determining Life-Supporting Conditions on Sci-Fi Planets

In this guidebook, you'll learn how to use scientific scans and analyses to determine the potential for life on various fictional planets. We will focus on the planets Glaciera, Umbra, Oceanus, and Eden Prime. By conducting specific scans and interpreting the outcomes, you can systematically rule out planets that do not support life. Each scan outcome dictates which planets are eliminated as potential life-supporting worlds, adhering to a process of exclusion rather than confirmation.

## Overview of the Planets

- **Glaciera**: Known for its icy conditions and possible methane-rich atmosphere.
- **Umbra**: Characterized by extremely cold temperatures and no volcanic activity.
- **Oceanus**: Notable for an atmosphere possibly rich in ammonia and the absence of liquid water on its surface.
- **Eden Prime**: Suspected to have a carbon dioxide-dominant atmosphere, often regarded as a potential candidate for supporting some forms of life.

## Available Scans and Analyses

1. **Atmospheric Composition Analysis**: Determines the predominant gases within a planet's atmosphere, crucial for assessing its potential to support life forms.

2. **Surface Temperature Measurement**: Provides a temperature range on the planet’s surface, helping to ascertain habitability based on thermal conditions.

3. **Liquid Water Detection**: Identifies the presence or absence of liquid water, a key indicator of life-supporting environments.

4. **Volcanic Activity Assessment**: Detects active volcanic processes, which can influence atmospheric composition and surface conditions.

5. **Stellar Flux Analysis**: Measures the amount of stellar radiation reaching the planet, affecting environmental conditions and habitability.

6. **Magnetic Field Assessment**: Evaluates the presence and strength of a planet's magnetic field, important for shielding life from harmful cosmic radiation.

## Scan Outcomes and Rule-Out Criteria

### 1. Atmospheric Composition Analysis

- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: No exclusions.
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Rule out **Eden Prime**.
- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out **Glaciera**.
- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out **Oceanus**.

### 2. Surface Temperature Measurement

- **(-200, -50)** °C: Rule out **Glaciera** and **Umbra**.
- **(-50, 0)** °C: Further eliminate **Umbra**.
- **(0, 50)** °C & **(50, 100)** °C & **(100, 300)** °C: No exclusions.

### 3. Liquid Water Detection

- **Liquid Water Present**: No exclusions.
- **No Liquid Water Detected**: Rule out **Oceanus**.

### 4. Volcanic Activity Assessment

- **Active Volcanoes**: No exclusions.
- **No Volcanic Activity**: Rule out **Glaciera** and **Umbra**.

### 5. Stellar Flux Analysis

- **(0, 1) Stellar Units**: Rule out **Glaciera** and **Umbra**.
- **(1, 1.5) Stellar Units** & **(1.5, 3) Stellar Units**: No exclusions.

### 6. Magnetic Field Assessment

- **Strong Magnetic Field**: No exclusions.
- **Weak Magnetic Field**: No exclusions.
- **No Detectable Magnetic Field**: Rule out **Glaciera** and **Umbra**.

## Conclusion

By carefully analyzing the results from each scan, you can determine which planets to exclude in the search for life-supporting environments. Each scan result narrows down the list of possible habitable planets, allowing you to focus on the most promising candidates. Remember, these observations are exclusionary, meaning that identifying certain conditions negates the possibility of life on specific planets based on this framework.
