## Sci-Fi Guidebook: Determining Planetary Viability for Life

This guidebook is designed to assist you in determining whether any of the four fictional planets, Pandora, Gaia, Hydra, and Neptunia, can support life. We utilize six advanced scanning and sampling techniques to effectively eliminate planets based on specific outcomes. Each scan represents a unique dataset gathered during exploration missions.

### Planets Overview

- **Pandora**: Known for its high atmospheric oxygen levels.
- **Gaia**: Has unique atmospheric properties with distinct levels of carbon dioxide and ammonia.
- **Hydra**: Characterized by a nitrogen-rich atmosphere and an absence of tectonic activity.
- **Neptunia**: Exhibits aurora activity and is surrounded by ice rings.

### Scans and Samples

1. **Oxygen Level Test**:
   - This test measures the percentage of oxygen levels in the planet's atmosphere.
   - Outcomes:
     - **0-10%**: Rule out none.
     - **10-20%**: Rule out none.
     - **20-30%**: Rule out none.
     - **30-100%**: Rule out Pandora.
   
2. **Tectonic Plate Activity Check**:
   - Determines if tectonic plates on the planet are active, indicating geological movement.
   - Outcomes:
     - **Active Tectonic Plates**: Rule out none.
     - **No Tectonic Activity**: Rule out Hydra.
   
3. **Aurora Activity Observation**:
   - Observes the presence of auroras which often suggest magnetic field interactions with solar winds.
   - Outcomes:
     - **Aurora Detected**: Rule out Neptunia.
     - **No Auroras**: Rule out none.
   
4. **Carbon Dioxide Concentration Check**:
   - Measures the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
   - Outcomes:
     - **0-0.03%**: Rule out Gaia.
     - **0.03-1%**: Rule out none.
     - **1-10%**: Rule out none.
     - **10-100%**: Rule out none.
   
5. **Atmospheric Composition Analysis**:
   - Analyzes the dominant gases present in the planet's atmosphere.
   - Outcomes:
     - **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out Hydra.
     - **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Rule out Gaia.
     - **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out none.
     - **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out Gaia.
   
6. **Planetary Ring Composition Analysis**:
   - Studies the composition and presence of rings surrounding the planet.
   - Outcomes:
     - **Ice Rings**: Rule out Neptunia.
     - **Rocky Rings**: Rule out none.
     - **No Rings**: Rule out none.

### Conclusion

By applying each scan and understanding its outcomes, explorers can systematically eliminate each planet from the list of potential life-supporting worlds based on the specific observations collected. This methodology ensures that only planets with the most suitable environmental conditions for life will remain under consideration in this fictional universe. Happy exploring!
