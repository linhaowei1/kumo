# Guidebook for Determining Life-Supporting Planets in "The Astra System"

Welcome to the futuristic adventure of evaluating extraterrestrial worlds to determine their potential to support life. This guidebook will help you navigate the complex task of analyzing the planets within "The Astra System" using advanced scans and samples.

## Overview of the Planets

1. **Zephyria**: A planet with a volatile atmosphere, known for its striking sunsets and challenging surface conditions.

2. **Oceanus**: A water-world cloaked in dense clouds and mystery, providing unique challenges for exploration.

3. **Gaia**: Aptly named for its Earth-like qualities, Gaia presents both promise and peril with a complex atmospheric setup.

4. **Borealis**: A frigid world with temperatures plunging to extreme lows, wrapped in silence and icy landscapes.

## Scans and Samples to Evaluate Planetary Habitability

In your voyage across these celestial bodies, a suite of scientific scans is available to assist in the assessment of life-supporting potential. Here is how each scan works and what they reveal:

### 1. **Atmospheric Composition Analysis**
Analyzing the atmospheric makeup to understand the primary gases present.
- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: All planets remain viable.
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Exclude **Gaia** and **Zephyria**.
- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: All planets remain viable.
- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Exclude **Oceanus**, **Gaia**, and **Zephyria**.

### 2. **Surface Temperature Measurement**
Recording temperature ranges to identify suitable climates.
- **(−200, −50) Celsius**: Exclude **Borealis**.
- **(−50, 0) Celsius**: Exclude **Borealis**.
- **(0, 50) Celsius**: All planets remain viable.
- **(50, 100) Celsius**: All planets remain viable.
- **(100, 300) Celsius**: All planets remain viable.

### 3. **Magnetic Field Assessment**
Determining the presence and strength of the magnetic field, crucial for protecting life components.
- **Strong Magnetic Field**: All planets remain viable.
- **Weak Magnetic Field**: Exclude **Zephyria**.
- **No Detectable Magnetic Field**: All planets remain viable.

### 4. **Carbon Dioxide Concentration Check**
Evaluating CO2 levels, important for understanding atmospheric interactions with potential life.
- **(0, 0.03)% CO2**: Exclude **Gaia**.
- **(0.03, 1)% CO2**: All planets remain viable.
- **(1, 10)% CO2**: All planets remain viable.
- **(10, 100)% CO2**: All planets remain viable.

### 5. **Average Rainfall Measurement**
Measuring rainfall to gauge hydrological cycles.
- **(0, 10) mm per year**: All planets remain viable.
- **(10, 200) mm per year**: All planets remain viable.
- **(200, 1000) mm per year**: Exclude **Oceanus** and **Gaia**.

### 6. **Liquid Water Detection**
Identifying the presence of liquid water, a crucial component for life.
- **Liquid Water Present**: All planets remain viable.
- **No Liquid Water Detected**: Exclude **Oceanus**, **Gaia**, and **Zephyria**.

## Conclusion

This guidebook equips you to navigate the complexities and wonders of The Astra System's planets through targeted scientific validation. Remember, ruling out potential planets relies heavily on the exclusionary criteria defined by each scan's outcomes. By systematically applying these scans, you can hone in on the planets with the highest likelihood of supporting life.

Adventure awaits as you explore and uncover the mysteries hidden among the stars. Safe travels!
