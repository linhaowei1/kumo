## Guidebook for Determining Life-supporting Planets in a Sci-fi Universe

### Introduction

In this guide, you will learn how to determine if a planet supports life by systematically ruling out planets based on specific scans and their outcomes. We focus on the fictional planets: Eden Prime, Elysium, Tempest, and Vulcania, using a range of detailed scans.

### Planets Overview

- **Eden Prime**: Known for its unusual carbon dioxide-dominant atmosphere.
- **Elysium**: Features an atmosphere rich in ammonia, lacking liquid water.
- **Tempest**: Exhibits an unstable orbit and high seismic activity.
- **Vulcania**: Characterized by a nitrogen- and methane-rich atmosphere, unstable orbit, no ice, high seismic activity, and low planetary albedo (0.0, 0.3 range).

### Scans and Their Outcomes

1. **Atmospheric Composition Analysis**
   - **Outcome: Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**
     - Rule out: Vulcania.
     
   - **Outcome: Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**
     - Rule out: Eden Prime.
     
   - **Outcome: Methane-rich Atmosphere**
     - Rule out: Vulcania.
     
   - **Outcome: Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**
     - Rule out: Elysium.

2. **Liquid Water Detection**
   - **Outcome: Liquid Water Present**
     - No planets are ruled out.
     
   - **Outcome: No Liquid Water Detected**
     - Rule out: Elysium.

3. **Ice Core Sampling**
   - **Outcome: Ice Present**
     - No planets are ruled out.
     
   - **Outcome: No Ice Detected**
     - Rule out: Vulcania.

4. **Orbit Stability Check**
   - **Outcome: Stable Orbit**
     - No planets are ruled out.
   
   - **Outcome: Unstable Orbit**
     - Rule out: Tempest, Vulcania.

5. **Planetary Albedo Measurement**
   - **Outcome: Albedo Range (0.0, 0.3)**
     - Rule out: Vulcania.
     
   - **Outcome: Albedo Range (0.3, 0.7)**
     - No planets are ruled out.
     
   - **Outcome: Albedo Range (0.7, 1.0)**
     - No planets are ruled out.

6. **Seismic Activity Monitoring**
   - **Outcome: High Seismic Activity**
     - Rule out: Tempest, Vulcania.
     
   - **Outcome: Low Seismic Activity**
     - No planets are ruled out.
     
   - **Outcome: No Seismic Activity**
     - No planets are ruled out.

### Conclusion

By applying these scans and systematically ruling out planets using the specified outcomes, you can efficiently determine which planets in this fictional setting do not support life. Always use this guide in the context of exploration, research, or mission planning to systematically eliminate planets that fail to meet the criteria for supporting life.
