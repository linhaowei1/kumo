# Guidebook for Determining Life-Sustaining Planets in a Sci-Fi Setting

In this guide, we will explore the methods and criteria used to assess whether any of the fictional planets—Oceanus, Glaciera, Tempest, and Solaris—can support life. This determination is based on various scans and samples collected from the planets. Each scan or sample provides certain outcomes that help us rule out planets that do not meet the criteria for supporting life. Below are the planets and the analyses that can be performed:

## Planets
1. **Oceanus**: Known for its aquatic environment, possibly an exoplanet with vast oceans.
2. **Glaciera**: An icy world with extreme cold conditions.
3. **Tempest**: Characterized by turbulent weather patterns and high-energy phenomena.
4. **Solaris**: A sun-like planet with a warm, energy-rich environment.

## Scans and Samples
To evaluate the planets, we will perform the following analyses:

1. **Average Rainfall Measurement**  
   - This test measures the amount of rainfall on a planet.
   - **Rule-Out Outcomes**:
     - (0, 10): No planets ruled out.
     - (10, 200): No planets ruled out.
     - (200, 1000): Oceanus is ruled out.

2. **Stellar Flux Analysis**  
   - Assesses the amount of stellar energy a planet receives, important for temperature regulation.
   - **Rule-Out Outcomes**:
     - (0, 1): Glaciera is ruled out.
     - (1, 1.5): No planets ruled out.
     - (1.5, 3): Tempest and Solaris are ruled out.

3. **Liquid Water Detection**  
   - Detects the presence of liquid water, crucial for life as we know it.
   - **Rule-Out Outcomes**:
     - Liquid Water Present: No planets ruled out.
     - No Liquid Water Detected: Oceanus is ruled out.

4. **Magnetic Field Assessment**  
   - Evaluates the planet's magnetic field, which can protect against harmful cosmic radiation.
   - **Rule-Out Outcomes**:
     - Strong Magnetic Field: Solaris is ruled out.
     - Weak Magnetic Field: No planets ruled out.
     - No Detectable Magnetic Field: Glaciera is ruled out.

5. **Atmospheric Composition Analysis**  
   - Analyzes the planet's atmosphere, focusing on its primary gases.
   - **Rule-Out Outcomes**:
     - Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere: Solaris is ruled out.
     - Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere: No planets ruled out.
     - Methane-rich Atmosphere: Solaris and Glaciera are ruled out.
     - Ammonia-rich Atmosphere: Oceanus is ruled out.

6. **Tectonic Plate Activity Check**  
   - Checks for geological activity, which may indicate a dynamic and life-supporting environment.
   - **Rule-Out Outcomes**:
     - Active Tectonic Plates: No planets ruled out.
     - No Tectonic Activity: Glaciera is ruled out.

## Conclusion

By carefully analyzing the outcomes from each scan and sample, we can systematically exclude planets that cannot support life. Only the planets that remain after applying all rule-out criteria are potential candidates for sustaining life. Use this guide to navigate the complex assessments and make informed decisions about each planet's habitability in your science fiction exploration.
