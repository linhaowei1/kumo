# Guidebook for Determining Life-Supporting Potential in Sci-Fi Planets

In this guidebook, we will explore the methods and criteria for determining whether a given planet can support life in our sci-fi setting. The planets in our study are **Vulcania**, **Elysium**, **Nova Terra**, and **Solaris**. To assess these planets, we will employ an array of scans and sampling techniques, using a process of elimination to determine which planets can potentially support life.

## Planets Overview

- **Vulcania**: Known for its harsh environment, yet intriguing due to potential bio-signatures and resource availability.
- **Elysium**: Enigmatic and mysterious, often considered a wildcard due to its unexplored characteristics.
- **Nova Terra**: Earth-like in some respects, making it a candidate for exploration despite its challenging conditions.
- **Solaris**: An enigmatic powerhouse with volatile atmospheric features but promising signs of life-supporting environments.

## Scans and Samples

To determine the viability of each planet to support life, we conduct the following scans and samplings:

1. **Magnetic Field Assessment**: Measures the strength of a planet's magnetic shield.
   - **Strong Magnetic Field**: Ruling out `Solaris` and `Vulcania`.
   - **Weak Magnetic Field**: Ruling out `Nova Terra`.
   - **No Detectable Magnetic Field**: Does not rule out any planets.

2. **Cosmic Ray Exposure Measurement**: Evaluates how much cosmic radiation reaches the surface.
   - **Exposure (0, 10)**: Does not rule out any planets.
   - **Exposure (10, 100)**: Ruling out `Solaris` and `Vulcania`.
   - **Exposure (100, 1000)**: Ruling out `Solaris`.

3. **Atmospheric Density Test**: Assesses the thickness of the planet's atmosphere.
   - **Density (0.0, 0.5)**: Does not rule out any planets.
   - **Density (0.5, 2)**: Does not rule out any planets.
   - **Density (2, 10)**: Ruling out `Solaris` and `Vulcania`.

4. **Ice Core Sampling**: Determines if ice, a crucial indicator of water and climate patterns, is present.
   - **Ice Present**: Does not rule out any planets.
   - **No Ice Detected**: Ruling out `Solaris` and `Vulcania`.

5. **Atmospheric Composition Analysis**: Analyzes the types of gases present in a planet's atmosphere.
   - **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: Ruling out `Solaris` and `Vulcania`.
   - **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Ruling out `Nova Terra`.
   - **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: Ruling out `Solaris` and `Vulcania`.
   - **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Ruling out `Nova Terra` and `Elysium`.

6. **Bio-Signature Gas Detection**: Detects gases typically associated with biological processes.
   - **Bio-Signature Gases Present**: Does not rule out any planets.
   - **No Bio-Signature Gases Detected**: Ruling out `Solaris` and `Vulcania`.

## Understanding Exclusion Criteria

Each of the tests above provides outcomes that help us exclude planets that are unlikely to support life. By focusing on the exclusion of certain planets when specific test outcomes are observed, we zero in on potential candidates for habitability. This systematic approach allows us to efficiently sift through data and identify planets worthy of further investigation.

## Conclusion

By using this guide, researchers and explorers can efficiently determine which planets might truly hold the potential to support life. This elimination-based approach ensures that our resources and time are optimally used to explore promising worlds in the vast universe.
