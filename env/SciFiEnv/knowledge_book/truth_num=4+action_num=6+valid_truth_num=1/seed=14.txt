# Guidebook for Determining Habitable Planets: A Sci-Fi Exploration

In this guidebook, we explore the process of determining which planets in our fictional universe can support life. We have four intriguing planets: Gaia, Tempest, Aurelia, and Glaciera. We will use a series of scientific scans and samples to evaluate these planets. Each scan provides specific outcomes that help us exclude certain planets from consideration as habitable worlds. 

The key scans and their outcomes that aid in ruling out planets are detailed below:

## Planets Overview

- **Gaia**: Known for its Earth-like features, potentially a prime candidate for life.
- **Tempest**: A planet with intense atmospheric phenomena and dramatic seasonal swings.
- **Aurelia**: Mysterious and less understood, it requires more data for assessment.
- **Glaciera**: Dominated by ice, with intriguing subsurface features.

## Scans and Samples

### 1. **Carbon Dioxide Concentration Check**
This scan measures the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the planet.

- **Outcome Analysis**:
  - **Concentration (0, 0.03%)**: **Rule out Gaia**.
  - **Concentration (0.03, 1%)**: No exclusions made based on this outcome.
  - **Concentration (1, 10%)**: **Rule out Glaciera**.
  - **Concentration (10, 100%)**: No exclusions made based on this outcome.

### 2. **Subsurface Ocean Detection**
This test checks for the presence of an ocean beneath the planet's surface.

- **Outcome Analysis**:
  - **Subsurface Ocean Present**: **Rule out Glaciera**.
  - **No Subsurface Ocean**: No exclusions made based on this outcome.

### 3. **Planetary Axis Tilt Measurement**
This scan assesses the degree of tilt in a planet’s axis, which affects climate and seasons.

- **Outcome Analysis**:
  - **Tilt (0, 5 degrees)**: **Rule out Glaciera**.
  - **Tilt (5, 30 degrees)**: No exclusions made based on this outcome.
  - **Tilt (30, 90 degrees)**: **Rule out Tempest**.

### 4. **Stellar Flux Analysis**
This evaluates the amount of energy a planet receives from its star.

- **Outcome Analysis**:
  - **Flux (0, 1 units)**: **Rule out Glaciera**.
  - **Flux (1, 1.5 units)**: No exclusions made based on this outcome.
  - **Flux (1.5, 3 units)**: **Rule out Tempest**.

### 5. **Seasonal Variation Analysis**
Assesses if the planet experiences significant seasonal changes.

- **Outcome Analysis**:
  - **Significant Seasonal Changes**: No exclusions made based on this outcome.
  - **No Seasonal Variation**: **Rule out Glaciera**.

### 6. **Methane Detection**
Checks for the presence of methane in the planet’s atmosphere, which can indicate biological processes.

- **Outcome Analysis**:
  - **Methane Detected**: No exclusions made based on this outcome.
  - **No Methane Detected**: **Rule out Glaciera**.

## Synthesis of Results

By gathering data from each scan and applying the exclusion rules, we can gradually narrow down which of the planets might support life. If a planet is ruled out by any of these scans, it is unlikely to support life as we know it. Use this guide to explore our fictional universe's potential for life beyond Earth!
