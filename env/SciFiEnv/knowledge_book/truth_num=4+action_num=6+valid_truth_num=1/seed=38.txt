# Guidebook for Determining Life-Supporting Planets in a Sci-Fi Universe

Welcome to your galactic exploration guidebook. Here, we aim to equip you with the tools needed to assess whether a planet can support life in our fictional universe. We will focus on four fascinating planets: Hydra, Solaris, Vulcania, and Pandora. By conducting various scans and collecting samples, we can eliminate planets that aren't suitable for life. Remember, in this guide, we focus on ruling out planets based on observed outcomes.

## Planets Overview

- **Hydra**: A mysterious planet with largely undetermined conditions. Known for its stable geological structure.
- **Solaris**: A bright, radiant planet that often defies the odds with its extreme conditions.
- **Vulcania**: A planet characterized by fiery conditions and notable gravitational pulls.
- **Pandora**: An enigmatic world with abundant oxygen levels, hinting at its potential to support life.

## Scans and Samples

The following scans and samples provide critical data to determine which planets should be ruled out as life-support possibilities:

### 1. Radiation Level Measurement

- **0 to 10 Units**: Rules out no planets. (Open for exploration)
- **10 to 100 Units**: Rules out Solaris and Vulcania.
- **100 to 1000 Units**: Rules out Solaris and Vulcania.
- **1000 to 10000 Units**: Rules out Solaris only.

### 2. Oxygen Level Test

- **0% to 10%**: Rules out Solaris and Vulcania.
- **10% to 20%**: Rules out no planets. (Open for exploration)
- **20% to 30%**: Rules out no planets. (Open for exploration)
- **30% to 100%**: Rules out Pandora. (Despite high oxygen, consider other factors)

### 3. Tectonic Plate Activity Check

- **Active Tectonic Plates**: Rules out no planets. (Geological activity present)
- **No Tectonic Activity**: Rules out Hydra. (Stable surface but may lack dynamic earth processes)

### 4. Sulfur Dioxide Concentration Check

- **0 to 0.1 Units**: Rules out no planets. (Open for exploration)
- **0.1 to 1 Units**: Rules out Solaris and Vulcania.
- **1 to 10 Units**: Rules out Solaris and Vulcania.

### 5. Gravitational Field Strength Test

- **0.0 to 0.5 Units**: Rules out no planets. (Low gravitational influence)
- **0.5 to 1.5 Units**: Rules out no planets. (Earth-like gravity)
- **1.5 to 3.0 Units**: Rules out Solaris and Vulcania.
- **3.0 to 10.0 Units**: Rules out Vulcania. (Strong gravitational pull)

### 6. Atmospheric Density Test

- **0.0 to 0.5 Units**: Rules out no planets. (Thin atmosphere)
- **0.5 to 2 Units**: Rules out no planets. (Moderate atmosphere)
- **2 to 10 Units**: Rules out Solaris and Vulcania.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the various outcomes from each scan and sample, explorers can systematically rule out planets that are not conducive to supporting life. The remaining planets, which are not eliminated by negative outcomes, warrant further investigation. Use this guide as a strategic tool during your interstellar exploration and make calculated decisions in your quest for habitable worlds. Happy exploring!
