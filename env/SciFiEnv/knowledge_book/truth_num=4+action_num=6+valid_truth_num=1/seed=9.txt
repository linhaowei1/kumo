# Guidebook for Determining Life-Supporting Planets in a Sci-Fi Setting

In the distant reaches of space, assessing a planet's capability to support life is a complex but essential task for interstellar explorers. This guidebook outlines a methodical approach using specific scans and analyses to determine the potential for life on four fictional planets: Hydra, Solaris, Glaciera, and Desertus. Each scan or sample provides data that helps eliminate planets that are unsuitable for life.

## Planets Overview

1. **Hydra**: Known for its mysterious lack of tectonic activity and toxic soil composition. 
2. **Solaris**: Characterized by its strong magnetic field and toxic soil.
3. **Glaciera**: An icy planet with no tectonic activity, aurora visibility, a weak or non-existent magnetic field, poor soil nutrients, low wind speeds, and a minimal planetary axis tilt.
4. **Desertus**: A vast desert planet with no auroras, a strong magnetic field, poor soil nutrients, and high wind speeds.

## Scans and Samples

1. **Tectonic Plate Activity Check**
   - **Active Tectonic Plates**: No planet is ruled out under this condition.
   - **No Tectonic Activity**: Exclude Hydra and Glaciera as they experience no tectonic activity.

2. **Aurora Activity Observation**
   - **Aurora Detected**: Exclude Glaciera as it is the only planet where auroras are observed.
   - **No Auroras**: Exclude Desertus where no auroral activity is detected.

3. **Magnetic Field Assessment**
   - **Strong Magnetic Field**: Exclude Solaris and Desertus for having a strong magnetic presence, unsuitable for certain life forms.
   - **Weak Magnetic Field**: No planets fall into this category.
   - **No Detectable Magnetic Field**: Exclude Glaciera and Hydra for lacking a detectable magnetic field.

4. **Soil Nutrient Analysis**
   - **Rich in Nutrients**: No planets appear rich in nutrients.
   - **Poor in Nutrients**: Exclude Glaciera and Desertus for poor nutrient soil, limiting life sustainability.
   - **Toxic Soil Composition**: Exclude Solaris and Hydra due to toxic soil conditions.

5. **Wind Speed Measurement**
   - **Low Wind Speed (0-10 m/s)**: Exclude Glaciera, which falls into this category of low wind speeds.
   - **Moderate to High Wind Speed (10-500 m/s)**: No planets meet these criteria.
   - **Very High Wind Speed (100-500 m/s)**: Exclude Desertus for its excessive wind speeds.

6. **Planetary Axis Tilt Measurement**
   - **Minimal Tilt (0-5 degrees)**: Exclude Glaciera, which has minimal axial tilt.
   - **Moderate to Extreme Tilt (5-90 degrees)**: No planets meet these tilt criteria.

## Conclusion

By applying the exclusion criteria based on the detailed outcomes from each scan or sample, explorers can systematically eliminate planets that are unsuitable for life. The approach ensures that efforts are focused on planets with the best potential for supporting life, facilitating efficient exploration in the vastness of space.
