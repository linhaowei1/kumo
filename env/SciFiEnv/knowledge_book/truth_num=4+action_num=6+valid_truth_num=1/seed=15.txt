# Guide to Determining Life Support Potential on Sci-Fi Planets

Welcome to the exploratory guidebook on assessing whether distant planets can support life, set in a fantastical sci-fi universe. Here, we meticulously evaluate each planet's conditions using advanced scans and samples. The main planets under study include Hyperion, Zephyria, Tempest, and Vulcania, and are analyzed through a series of tests. Each test will exclude certain planets based on the observed outcomes, helping us determine which potential planets are worth further exploration.

## Planets Overview

1. **Hyperion**
   - An enigmatic world with diverse landscapes but with unexplored potential for supporting life.

2. **Zephyria**
   - Known for its volatile weather patterns but remains mysterious in its ability to harbor life forms.

3. **Tempest**
   - A planet characterized by intense atmospheric conditions that induces curiosity about its livability.

4. **Vulcania**
   - A fiery realm with extreme environmental conditions and complex characteristics that challenge life-support assessments.

## Scans and Samples

These scientific tools allow us to gauge different planetary conditions. The scans provide data, which when interpreted, allow us to eliminate certain planets from the possibility of supporting life based on the outcomes.

### 1. Surface Gravity Measurement

This scan determines the gravitational pull on a planet's surface:
- **(0.0, 0.5):** Rules out Hyperion due to extremely low gravity.
- **(0.5, 1.5):** No planets are excluded here; gravitational conditions close to Earth's standard are preferred.
- **(1.5, 3.0):** Rules out Tempest and Vulcania due to high gravity levels that might be oppressive to life.
- **(3.0, 10.0):** Rules out Vulcania for extreme gravitational forces.

### 2. Stellar Flux Analysis

This scan assesses the amount of stellar energy a planet receives:
- **(0, 1):** Eliminates none; insufficient stellar energy may not be ideal but rules out no planet outright.
- **(1, 1.5):** No exclusions; moderate stellar flux implies potential for life.
- **(1.5, 3):** Rules out Tempest and Vulcania due to overheating concerns and intense stellar radiation.

### 3. Bio-Signature Gas Detection

Detects gases indicative of biological processes:
- **Bio-Signature Gases Present:** Bio-signature gases are detected; hence, zero exclusions.
- **No Bio-Signature Gases Detected:** Rules out Vulcania due to the absence of biological indicators.

### 4. Carbon Dioxide Concentration Check

This scan measures CO₂ levels; extreme amounts could be detrimental:
- **(0, 0.03):** Excludes none; considered an Earth-like range.
- **(0.03, 1):** Excludes none; tolerable levels possibly.
- **(1, 10):** Rules out Vulcania due to potentially toxic CO₂ concentrations.
- **(10, 100):** Rules out Vulcania for intensely high CO₂, likely inhospitable for life.

### 5. Magnetic Field Assessment

Analyzes the protection against cosmic and solar radiation offered by a planet's magnetic field:
- **Strong Magnetic Field:** Vulcania is ruled out because conditions supporting life may be limited despite magnetic protection.
- **Weak Magnetic Field:** Zephyria is ruled out for vulnerability to harmful radiation.
- **No Detectable Magnetic Field:** No exclusions, though potential life-support issues present.

### 6. Average Rainfall Measurement

Looks at average annual precipitation, vital for sustaining ecosystems:
- **(0, 10):** Rules out Vulcania for scant rainfall, unfavorable for supporting diverse ecosystems.
- **(10, 200):** No exclusions; indicates moderate potential.
- **(200, 1000):** No exclusions; generally signals rich aquatic presence conducive to life.

In conclusion, through interpreting these scans and sample outcomes, we can strategically exclude planets like Hyperion, Tempest, and Vulcania at various stages during the investigatory process. This guide will focus our explorations and direct us towards potential havens for life beyond our own world. Happy exploring, and may your discoveries be profound!
