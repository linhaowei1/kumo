# Guidebook for Determining Planetary Habitability in a Sci-Fi Setting

Welcome to the guidebook for determining whether a planet is capable of supporting life in our thrilling sci-fi universe. This guide is essential for explorers and scientists venturing into the unknown territories of space, specifically across the celestial bodies known as Mirage, Neptunia, Desertus, and Helios. Let's dive into the scans and samples that will help us understand the possibilities for life on these planets by the process of exclusion based on specific outcomes.

## Planets Overview

- **Mirage**: A mysterious world, suspected to possess extreme climates.
- **Neptunia**: A chilly and possibly aurora-rich world with unique characteristics.
- **Desertus**: Known for its harsh, desert-like conditions.
- **Helios**: A bright, radiantly sunny planet thought to have diverse temperatures.

## Scans and Samples

1. **Surface Temperature Measurement**
   - This test measures the surface temperature of a planet.
   - Outcomes:
     - **(-200, -50)°C**: Exclude Neptunia
     - **(-50, 0)°C**: Exclude Neptunia
     - **(0, 50)°C**: No exclusions
     - **(50, 100)°C**: Exclude Desertus, Mirage
     - **(100, 300)°C**: No exclusions

2. **Oxygen Level Test**
   - This assessment evaluates the oxygen concentration in the planet's atmosphere.
   - Outcomes:
     - **0-10%**: Exclude Desertus
     - **10-20%**: No exclusions
     - **20-30%**: No exclusions
     - **30-100%**: Exclude Helios

3. **UV Radiation Level Measurement**
   - Measures levels of ultraviolet radiation on the planet, which can affect habitability.
   - Outcomes:
     - **0-10**: No exclusions
     - **10-100**: Exclude Desertus
     - **100-1000**: No exclusions

4. **Solar Radiation Absorption Test**
   - Determines how much solar radiation the planet absorbs.
   - Outcomes:
     - **High Absorption**: Exclude Desertus
     - **Moderate Absorption**: No exclusions
     - **Low Absorption**: No exclusions

5. **Planetary Axis Tilt Measurement**
   - Measures the tilt of the planet's axis, influencing climate and seasons.
   - Outcomes:
     - **0-5 degrees**: Exclude Neptunia
     - **5-30 degrees**: No exclusions
     - **30-90 degrees**: No exclusions

6. **Aurora Activity Observation**
   - Observes the presence of auroras, which can indicate atmospheric phenomena.
   - Outcomes:
     - **Aurora Detected**: Exclude Neptunia
     - **No Auroras**: Exclude Desertus

## Instructions for Use

When evaluating a planet's ability to support life, conduct all the scans and observe the outcomes carefully. Use the rule-out approach based on the scan results:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Perform each listed scan on a target planet.
2. Compare the observed outcome with the corresponding outcome criteria.
3. Exclude any planets as indicated by the outcome information.
4. Continue the process with all scans to narrow down which planets do not meet habitability criteria.
5. The planets left after all exclusions can be considered potential candidates for supporting life, subject to further analysis and exploration.

Through this meticulous process of elimination, explorers and researchers can discern the most promising worlds for life among Mirage, Neptunia, Desertus, and Helios, enhancing the chances of successful discoveries in our sci-fi universe. Enjoy your interstellar adventures!
