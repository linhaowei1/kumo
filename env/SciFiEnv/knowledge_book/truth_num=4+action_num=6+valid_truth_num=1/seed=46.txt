# Guidebook for Determining Life-Supporting Planets

Welcome to the comprehensive guidebook designed to help explorers and scientists navigate the complexities of identifying planets capable of supporting life in our sci-fi universe. In this guidebook, we will focus on evaluating four planets: Elysium, Borealis, Vulcania, and Aurelia, using various scientific scans and analyses. The goal is to understand which outcomes from these scans rule out specific planets from being viable options for life support.

## Planet Profiles

### 1. **Elysium**
- Known for its serene landscapes and theorized to potentially house subsurface water.

### 2. **Borealis**
- A planet with vast polar ice caps, suggesting unique climatic conditions.

### 3. **Vulcania**
- Volatile surface activity and peculiar atmospheric phenomena are characteristic of Vulcania.

### 4. **Aurelia**
- Noted for its bright, reflective surface and extensive desert regions.

## Scans and Their Implications

To determine the habitability of each planet, several scans are employed. The interpretations of these scans involve ruling out planets unable to meet essential criteria for supporting life.

### a. **Liquid Water Detection**
- **Outcome: Liquid Water Present**: No immediate exclusions.
- **Outcome: No Liquid Water Detected**: Rule out Elysium and Aurelia. These planets lack the crucial element of liquid water necessary for sustaining life as we know it.

### b. **Magnetic Pole Reversal History**
- **Outcome: Recent Pole Reversal**: Rule out Vulcania. The recent pole reversal might imply instability in its electromagnetic field, which could disrupt the sustainment of life.
- **Outcome: Stable Poles**: No exclusions occur based on stable poles.
- **Outcome: No Magnetic Field**: In the absence of a magnetic field, no exclusions are specified.

### c. **Radiation Level Measurement**
- **Outcome: Radiation Levels (0, 10)**: No planets are ruled out with radiation levels in this range.
- **Outcome: Radiation Levels (10, 100)**: Rule out Vulcania, indicating radiation levels possibly detrimental to biological organisms.
- **Outcome: Radiation Levels (100, 1000)**: Vulcania is also ruled out at this intensity range, which further signifies challenging conditions for life.
- **Outcome: Radiation Levels (1000, 10000)**: No specified exclusions within this extreme radiation range.

### d. **Presence of Organic Molecules Test**
- **Outcome: Organic Molecules Present**: No exclusions suggested.
- **Outcome: No Organic Molecules Detected**: Rule out Vulcania. The absence of organic molecules, essential building blocks of life, necessitates this exclusion.

### e. **UV Radiation Level Measurement**
- **Outcome: UV Levels (0, 10)**: No exclusions suggested.
- **Outcome: UV Levels (10, 100)**: Rule out Vulcania due to these medium UV radiation levels which could be hostile to organic life forms.

### f. **Average Rainfall Measurement**
- **Outcome: Average Rainfall (0, 10)**: Rule out Vulcania. Insufficient rainfall may result in an ecosystem too barren to support life.
- **Outcome: Average Rainfall (10, 200)**: No planets are excluded at this level.
- **Outcome: Average Rainfall (200, 1000)**: No exclusions identified within this optimal range for many types of life.

## Conclusion

By utilizing each scan and analyzing the outcomes, we can systematically eliminate planets that do not meet the necessary conditions for supporting life. Remember, exclusions are a vital part of the selection process, narrowing down potential candidates for further exploration and study. As promising as the quest for life-bearing planets is, this structured approach ensures comprehensive assessment and informed decision-making as you journey through the cosmos.
