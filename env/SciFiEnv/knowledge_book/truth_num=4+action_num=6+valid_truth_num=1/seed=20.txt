# Guidebook for Determining Life-Supporting Planets in a Sci-Fi Setting

In this guidebook, you will find comprehensive steps to determine if a fictional planet supports life. We will use scans and samples to assess each planet's viability. The planets in our focus are Desertus, Glaciera, Gaia, and Neptunia.

## Planets Overview

1. **Desertus**: Known for its extreme desert conditions and challenging environment.
2. **Glaciera**: A planet covered in ice, with an extremely cold climate.
3. **Gaia**: A balanced Earth-like planet with diverse ecosystems.
4. **Neptunia**: A mysterious world with vast oceans and unknown depths.

## Scans and Samples

To evaluate the planets, specific scans and tests are conducted. The analyses help rule out planets that do not show characteristics suitable for supporting life.

### 1. Carbon Dioxide Concentration Check
This scan measures the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere.

- **(0, 0.03):** If CO2 levels are between 0 and 0.03, rule out Desertus and Gaia. These planets have CO2 concentrations that don't support the possibility of life as we know it.
- **(0.03, 1):** No planets are excluded in this range.
- **(1, 10):** Rule out Glaciera, which suggests uncommon CO2 levels for life.
- **(10, 100):** No planets are excluded as none fit within this range.

### 2. Bio-Signature Gas Detection
This scan identifies gases typically associated with biological processes.

- **Bio-Signature Gases Present:** Unfortunately, no planets are ruled out based on the presence of bio-signature gases.
- **No Bio-Signature Gases Detected:** Rule out Neptunia and Desertus, as these planets show no bio-signature gases indicative of life.

### 3. Magnetic Field Assessment
Assesses the strength of a planetâ€™s magnetic field, which is crucial for protecting a biosphere from cosmic and solar radiation.

- **Strong Magnetic Field:** Rule out Desertus as it has a strong magnetic field not typically associated with life presence.
- **Weak Magnetic Field:** No removals here, as no planets exhibit this characteristic.
- **No Detectable Magnetic Field:** Rule out Glaciera, as the lack of a magnetic field suggests conditions that are unlikely to nurture life.

### 4. Presence of Organic Molecules Test
Tests for organic molecules that are fundamental components of life.

- **Organic Molecules Present:** No exclusions because no known planets demonstrate this effectively.
- **No Organic Molecules Detected:** Rule out Desertus, which shows an absence of organic molecules.

### 5. Methane Detection
Detects methane, often a byproduct of biological activity.

- **Methane Detected:** Unfortunately, this does not provide grounds for ruling out any planet due to methane presence.
- **No Methane Detected:** Rule out Glaciera and Desertus, which have no methane traces.

### 6. Surface Gravity Measurement
Measures the gravitational force at the surface, crucial for maintaining an atmosphere conducive to life.

- **(0.0, 0.5):** Rule out Neptunia and Glaciera, as low gravity is inconsistent with environments that can support higher life forms.
- **(0.5, 1.5):** No planets are excluded in this range.
- **(1.5, 3.0):** No exclusions here.
- **(3.0, 10.0):** No planets fall into this range to be ruled out.

## Conclusion

When assessing a planet's habitability potential based on the scans and samples, use this guide to systematically eliminate planets incompatible with life-sustaining properties. By following these steps, you can narrow down the list of potential life-supporting planets in your sci-fi narrative.
