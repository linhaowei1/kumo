# Guidebook for Determining Planetary Habitability in a Sci-Fi Setting

Welcome to the Galactic Explorer's Guide to assessing the habitability of planets in the cosmos! As an interstellar researcher, this guide will help you determine whether the planets Hydra, Nova Terra, Tempest, and Vulcania can support life based on various scans and samples. This guide uses a "rule-out" methodology where specific outcomes from planetary analyses will exclude certain planets from consideration.

## Planets Overview

1. **Hydra**: Known for its toxic soil composition, Hydra poses challenges for agriculture and habitation.
2. **Nova Terra**: Characterized by its carbon dioxide and ammonia-rich atmosphere, Nova Terra is an environment with significant atmospheric constraints.
3. **Tempest**: A dynamic planet with notable rocky rings and strong gravitational fields, Tempest's radiation levels and variable axis tilt may provide challenges.
4. **Vulcania**: With both nitrogen and methane in its atmosphere and a history of poor soil nutrients, Vulcania presents distinct ecological hurdles.

## Scans and Samples with Rule-Out Criteria

### 1. Atmospheric Composition Analysis
- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out Hydra and Vulcania.
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Rule out Nova Terra.
- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out Vulcania.
- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out Nova Terra.

### 2. Planetary Ring Composition Analysis
- **Ice Rings**: No rule-out planets (not applicable).
- **Rocky Rings**: Rule out Tempest.
- **No Rings**: No rule-out planets (not applicable).

### 3. Gravitational Field Strength Test
- **Field Strength (0.0 to 0.5)**: No rule-out planets (not applicable).
- **Field Strength (0.5 to 1.5)**: No rule-out planets (not applicable).
- **Field Strength (1.5 to 3.0)**: Rule out Tempest and Vulcania.
- **Field Strength (3.0 to 10.0)**: Rule out Tempest and Vulcania.

### 4. Soil Nutrient Analysis
- **Rich in Nutrients**: No rule-out planets (not applicable).
- **Poor in Nutrients**: Rule out Vulcania.
- **Toxic Soil Composition**: Rule out Hydra and Vulcania.

### 5. Radiation Level Measurement
- **Radiation Levels (0 to 10)**: No rule-out planets (not applicable).
- **Radiation Levels (10 to 100)**: Rule out Vulcania.
- **Radiation Levels (100 to 1000)**: Rule out Tempest and Vulcania.
- **Radiation Levels (1000 to 10000)**: No rule-out planets (not applicable).

### 6. Planetary Axis Tilt Measurement
- **Axis Tilt (0 to 5)**: No rule-out planets (not applicable).
- **Axis Tilt (5 to 30)**: No rule-out planets (not applicable).
- **Axis Tilt (30 to 90)**: Rule out Tempest.

## Conclusion

Performing these analyses and observing the corresponding outcomes will guide you in determining the potential habitability of these planets. By ruling out certain planets based on the exclusion criteria, you can navigate the intriguing environments of Hydra, Nova Terra, Tempest, and Vulcania with confidence in your quest to discover worlds that may support life. Good luck, explorer!
