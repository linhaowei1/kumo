# Guidebook for Determining Life-Supporting Planets in a Sci-Fi Setting

## Introduction

In the vast universe, determining whether a planet can support life involves careful examination and analysis. This guidebook will help you assess the viability of life on fictional planets using a series of scientific scans and tests. For this evaluation, we are focusing on four planets: **Oceanus**, **Glaciera**, **Helios**, and **Hyperion**. Each scan or test provides specific outcomes that can help rule out planets not suitable for life.

## Planet Descriptions

- **Oceanus**: Known for its vast oceans and mysterious weather patterns, Oceanus is hypothesized to have a unique atmospheric composition.
  
- **Glaciera**: A frozen world with icy landscapes, Glaciera is intriguing for its extreme cold temperatures and potential subsurface activity.
  
- **Helios**: A planet characterized by its intense heat and potentially breathable atmosphere, Helios‘ environment provides a unique challenge for life detection.
  
- **Hyperion**: With its diverse terrain and stable gravity, Hyperion offers a balanced environment but requires detailed analysis to determine its life-supporting potential.

## Scans and Samples

The following scans and tests have been devised to assess and rule out planets based on specific outcomes:

1. **Gravitational Field Strength Test**
   - Measures the strength of gravitational pull, categorized into four ranges.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **0.0 - 0.5**: Rule out **Glaciera** and **Hyperion**.
     - **0.5 - 1.5**: No planets ruled out.
     - **1.5 - 3.0**: No planets ruled out.
     - **3.0 - 10.0**: No planets ruled out.

2. **Oxygen Level Test**
   - Evaluates the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **0 - 10%**: No planets ruled out.
     - **10 - 20%**: No planets ruled out.
     - **20 - 30%**: No planets ruled out.
     - **30 - 100%**: Rule out **Helios**.

3. **Methane Detection**
   - Detects the presence of methane, a significant atmospheric component.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **Methane Detected**: No planets ruled out.
     - **No Methane Detected**: Rule out **Glaciera**.

4. **Volcanic Activity Assessment**
   - Analyzes seismic activity and volcanic presence on the planet’s surface.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **Active Volcanoes**: No planets ruled out.
     - **No Volcanic Activity**: Rule out **Glaciera**.

5. **Atmospheric Composition Analysis**
   - Determines the dominant gases found in the planet's atmosphere.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: No planets ruled out.
     - **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: No planets ruled out.
     - **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out **Glaciera**.
     - **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out **Oceanus**.

6. **Surface Temperature Measurement**
   - Records the planet’s surface temperature in degrees Celsius.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **-200 to -50°C**: Rule out **Glaciera**.
     - **-50 to 0°C**: No planets ruled out.
     - **0 to 50°C**: No planets ruled out.
     - **50 to 100°C**: No planets ruled out.
     - **100 to 300°C**: No planets ruled out.

## Conclusion

By systematically applying each scan and test to the planets in question, you can effectively exclude those unable to support life. Use this guidebook to navigate the complexity of life detection, ensuring that all observations are clearly linked to their corresponding rule-out criteria. Through diligent analysis, you will bring clarity to the possibility of life thriving on these distant worlds.
