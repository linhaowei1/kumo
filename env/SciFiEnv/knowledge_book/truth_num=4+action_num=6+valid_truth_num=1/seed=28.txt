# Guidebook for Determining Life-Supporting Planets in a Sci-Fi Setting

Welcome to the ultimate guidebook for evaluating the potential for life on various planets in our galaxy. This guide provides you with the necessary tools and information to assess four intriguing planets: **Desertus**, **Hydra**, **Umbra**, and **Hyperion**. By employing advanced scans and analyzing key outcomes, you will determine which planets cannot support life. 

## Planet Descriptions

1. **Desertus**: A dry, arid world with vast stretches of desert landscapes. Known for its extreme surface conditions, it's a challenging environment for life as we know it.

2. **Hydra**: This aqueous planet features vast oceans and a mysterious atmosphere. Its chemical makeup suggests unique, possibly hostile conditions for traditional forms of life.

3. **Umbra**: A planet shrouded in mystery, it is notable for its low-light conditions and hazy atmosphere. The planetâ€™s enigmatic nature makes it difficult to decipher its habitation potential.

4. **Hyperion**: A planet with varying surface conditions, ranging from extreme gravity to complex atmospheric dynamics. 

## Scans and Samples

To evaluate the planets, a series of advanced scans and samples are conducted. These scientific tools help rule out planets based on their undesirable characteristics for supporting life.

### 1. Surface Gravity Measurement

- **Outcome:** If gravity is measured between 0.0 and 0.5 Gs, rule out **Hyperion** and **Umbra**.
- **Explanation:** Extremely low gravity can lead to atmospheric loss and surface instability, making these planets less favorable for life.

### 2. Subsurface Ocean Detection

- **Outcome:** If no subsurface ocean is detected, rule out **Desertus**.
- **Explanation:** The absence of a subsurface ocean diminishes the availability of stable water sources, essential for supporting life.

### 3. Ammonia Levels Test

- **Outcome:** If high ammonia levels are detected, rule out **Hydra**.
- **Explanation:** Excessive ammonia is toxic to most known life forms, rendering the environment inhospitable for most biological processes.

### 4. Planetary Albedo Measurement

- **Outcome:** If the albedo falls between 0.0 and 0.3, rule out **Desertus**.
- **Explanation:** A low albedo indicates a planet absorbs too much sunlight, likely resulting in excessively high surface temperatures unsuitable for life.

### 5. Atmospheric Pressure Measurement

- **Outcome:** If atmospheric pressure is between 0 and 0.5 atmospheres, rule out **Umbra**.
- **Explanation:** Extremely low pressure environments are unable to retain a stable atmosphere necessary for life.

### 6. Atmospheric Composition Analysis

- **Outcome 1:** If the atmosphere is nitrogen-rich, rule out both **Desertus** and **Hydra**.
- **Outcome 2:** If the atmosphere is methane-rich, rule out **Desertus**.
- **Explanation:** An atmosphere dominated by these components suggests the likelihood of toxic or unfavorable conditions for sustaining life.

By adhering to these exclusion criteria, you can effectively narrow down the selection of planets that may harbor life. This guide encourages methodical exploration, utilizing scans and data to make informed decisions about the habitability of each celestial body.

In conclusion, this guide serves as a critical tool for any space explorer seeking to find hospitable environments in the universe. By carefully analyzing and interpreting the scans provided, you can make significant strides in discovering life-supporting planets. Safe travels and intriguing discoveries await!
