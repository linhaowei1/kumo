# Guidebook: Determining Life Support Potential on Sci-Fi Planets

In this guidebook, we shall explore the intricate process of determining whether a fictionally discovered planet might support life. The planets we're assessing are Borealis, Aurelia, Helios, and Zephyria. We have a suite of advanced scans and tests at our disposal to analyze various planetary characteristics. The outcomes of these scans indicate which planets do **not** support life, allowing us to eliminate them from consideration based on certain criteria.

## Planets Under Investigation

- **Borealis**: A planet with potentially extreme temperatures.
- **Aurelia**: Known for its unique atmospheric compositions.
- **Helios**: Exhibiting high oxygen levels.
- **Zephyria**: Characterized by a particularly weak magnetic field.

## Scans and Samples

We use the following scans and tests to assess planetary conditions:

1. **Surface Temperature Measurement**
2. **Magnetic Field Assessment**
3. **Oxygen Level Test**
4. **Atmospheric Composition Analysis**
5. **Liquid Water Detection**
6. **Volcanic Activity Assessment**

## Understanding the Outcomes

Each scan result enables exclusion of certain planets that fail to show potential for supporting life.

### Surface Temperature Measurement

- **(-200, -50) degrees**: Borealis is ruled out.
- **(-50, 0) degrees**: Borealis is ruled out.
- **(0, 50) degrees**: No planet is excluded.
- **(50, 100) degrees**: No planet is excluded.
- **(100, 300) degrees**: No planet is excluded.

### Magnetic Field Assessment

- **Strong Magnetic Field**: No planet is ruled out.
- **Weak Magnetic Field**: Zephyria is ruled out.
- **No Detectable Magnetic Field**: No planet is ruled out.

### Oxygen Level Test

- **0-10% Oxygen**: No planet is ruled out.
- **10-20% Oxygen**: No planet is ruled out.
- **20-30% Oxygen**: No planet is ruled out.
- **30-100% Oxygen**: Helios is ruled out.

### Atmospheric Composition Analysis

- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: No planet is ruled out.
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Aurelia and Zephyria are ruled out.
- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: No planet is ruled out.
- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Aurelia and Zephyria are ruled out.

### Liquid Water Detection

- **Liquid Water Present**: No planet is ruled out.
- **No Liquid Water Detected**: Aurelia and Zephyria are ruled out.

### Volcanic Activity Assessment

- **Active Volcanoes**: No planet is ruled out.
- **No Volcanic Activity**: No planet is ruled out.

## Conclusion

The exclusion outcomes from each scan allow researchers to identify, with process of elimination, which planets do not have the characteristics required for supporting life as we know it. Each test aids in narrowing down the possibilities by ruling out planets that do not fit life-supporting criteria based on the specific conditions tested.

By following this systematic approach, we enhance our understanding of these fictional planets and their potential for harboring life, offering a framework for evaluating planets beyond our current reach.
