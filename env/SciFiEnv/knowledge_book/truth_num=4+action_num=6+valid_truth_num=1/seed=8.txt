# Guidebook for Determining Life Support Potential on Planets in a Sci-Fi Setting

Welcome to the guidebook for determining whether a planet can support life within our designated database: the planets Aurelia, Solaris, Borealis, and Desertus. This guidebook employs specific scientific scans and analyses to methodically rule out planets that do not meet the criteria for supporting life. Our approach ensures that you systematically eliminate non-viable candidates through exclusion rules based on observable outcomes.

## Planets Overview

- **Aurelia**: A mysterious planet often cited for its absence of liquid water.
- **Solaris**: Known for extreme temperatures and high concentrations of carbon dioxide.
- **Borealis**: A planet with temperatures significantly lower than most others in our database.
- **Desertus**: Noted for its arid climate with minimal rainfall, and carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere.

## Scans and Samples Explained

Below, you’ll find detailed explanations of each scan and analysis method, accompanied by outcomes that guide you in excluding certain planets from being viable candidates for supporting life.

### 1. Surface Temperature Measurement

- **(-200, -50)°C & (-50, 0)°C**: Rule out **Borealis**. Despite the extreme cold, Borealis is not compatible due to other unidentified factors.
- **(0, 50)°C**: No planets ruled out. Further analysis required.
- **(50, 100)°C**: Exclude **Solaris** and **Desertus** due to potentially inhospitable warmth.
- **(100, 300)°C**: Rule out **Solaris**; it's too hot for life to thrive.

### 2. Liquid Water Detection

- **Liquid Water Present**: No planets ruled out, as this is a favorable condition.
- **No Liquid Water Detected**: Exclude **Aurelia** due to its lack of vital liquid water.

### 3. Carbon Dioxide Concentration Check

- **(0, 0.03)%**: Rule out **Desertus** due to inadequate levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
- **(0.03, 1)%**: No planets ruled out. This range is acceptable.
- **(1, 10)%** & **(10, 100)%**: Exclude **Solaris** due to uninhabitable CO2 concentrations.

### 4. Ice Core Sampling

- **Ice Present**: No planets ruled out, as frozen water can signify possible water sources upon melting.
- **No Ice Detected**: Exclude **Solaris** and **Desertus** due to lack of ice which may denote complete dryness or excessive heat.

### 5. Average Rainfall Measurement

- **(0, 10) mm/year**: Rule out **Desertus**; it’s too dry for supporting lush life.
- **(10, 200) mm/year** & **(200, 1000) mm/year**: No planets ruled out. These conditions can potentially support life.

### 6. Methane Detection

- **Methane Detected**: No planets ruled out. Methane's presence could be indicative of biological processes.
- **No Methane Detected**: Exclude **Solaris** and **Desertus**; lack of methane can suggest a sterile environment.

## Usage Instructions

To effectively use this guidebook, conduct each scan or analysis sequentially or concurrently, depending on technological capabilities and mission equipment. Utilize the outcomes to progressively eliminate planets from consideration for life-supporting conditions based on observed states.

This structured approach emphasizes precision in ruling out planets, allowing for a refined focus on those with potential. Continue additional tests, including searching for biological markers, to further narrow down the candidates and verify life-support potential.

By adhering closely to these procedural outcomes, you'll arrive at a targeted selection of planets for further exploration and potential colonization or study. Happy exploring in the vast worlds of the cosmos!
