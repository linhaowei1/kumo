# Sci-Fi Guidebook: Determining Life-Supporting Planets

### Introduction

Exploring the cosmos and discovering planets capable of supporting life is a key mission in sci-fi scenarios. This guidebook is designed to help you assess whether the planets Solaris, Oceanus, Nova Terra, and Helios could potentially support life based on various scientific scans and their outcomes. Each scan and sample test affects planet viability based on observations, leading to the exclusion of certain planets from consideration. Let's delve into this process further.

### Planets Overview

1. **Solaris**: Known for its intense solar radiation absorption and volcanic activity. It possesses a strong magnetic field.
2. **Oceanus**: A water-centric planet characterized by high average rainfall.
3. **Nova Terra**: Exhibits a weak magnetic field.
4. **Helios**: Details about Helios are not prominently featured in existing outcomes, suggesting further exploration is required for a comprehensive understanding.

### Scans and Samples

To determine the potential for supporting life, we perform specific scans and tests on these planets. Each has distinct outcomes that rule out planets from being habitable. Below is an outline of the scans, their possible outcomes, and the planets that each outcome rules out:

1. **Magnetic Field Assessment**
   - **Strong Magnetic Field**: Excludes Solaris from being viable.
   - **Weak Magnetic Field**: Excludes Nova Terra from consideration.
   - **No Detectable Magnetic Field**: Currently, no planets are excluded.

2. **Average Rainfall Measurement** (measured in millimeters per year)
   - **0 to 10 mm**: No exclusions are defined.
   - **10 to 200 mm**: No exclusions are defined.
   - **200 to 1000 mm**: Excludes Oceanus.

3. **Volcanic Activity Assessment**
   - **Active Volcanoes**: Excludes Solaris.
   - **No Volcanic Activity**: No planets are ruled out from this outcome.

4. **Stellar Flux Analysis** (measured in normalized units)
   - **0 to 1**: No exclusions are defined.
   - **1 to 1.5**: No exclusions are provided.
   - **1.5 to 3**: Excludes Solaris.

5. **Solar Radiation Absorption Test**
   - **High Absorption**: Excludes Solaris.
   - **Moderate Absorption**: No exclusions listed.
   - **Low Absorption**: No exclusions provided.

6. **Methane Detection**
   - **Methane Detected**: Currently rules out no planet.
   - **No Methane Detected**: Excludes Solaris.

### Summary

When assessing these planets for potential life-supporting conditions, utilize the scans to methodically eliminate planets that do not meet the criteria for habitability. Remember, the absence of a ruling-out outcome suggests that the planet remains viable within the scope of that specific scan.

For further expeditions and studies, additional data on Helios and the planetary boundaries unmentioned or not restricted within this guide should be considered for more comprehensive evaluations. Continue employing these rules as a foundational aspect of your exploration missions to ensure informed decisions in the astrobiological survey of extraterrestrial worlds.
