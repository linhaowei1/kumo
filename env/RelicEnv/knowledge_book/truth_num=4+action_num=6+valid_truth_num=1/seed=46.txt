Below, you will find explanations of the relic attributes we explore and detailing the examination methods used to identify or exclude these attributes.

## Attributes of Ancient Relics

1. **Bone-Engraved Markings**: These relics often contain intricate carvings made from bone. They suggest a connection to necromantic practices, possibly serving as vessels or conduits for dark arts.

2. **Observer Stone**: Known for its otherworldly associations, the Observer Stone is said to channel psionic energy, acting as both a witness and recorder of events in its vicinity.

3. **Arcane Conduit**: This attribute represents relics used to channel magical energies. They are typically inscribed with symbols that harmonize and amplify arcane magic.

4. **Tomb Guardian**: These relics are steeped in protective necromantic auras, historically used to watch over and safeguard burial sites from intruders.

      - Incomprehensible Markings: No attributes ruled out
      - Partial Translation: No attributes ruled out
      - Clear Translation: Rule out "Arcane Conduit"

3. **Necrotic Pulse Measurement**: This technique measures the necrotic energy levels within a relic to determine its connection to life-draining forces.

      - No Necrotic Signal: No attributes ruled out
      - Weak Necrotic Signature: No attributes ruled out
      - Overwhelming Necrosis: Rule out "Bone-Engraved Markings"

4. **Psionic Feedback Monitor**: Used to gauge the interaction of relics with psionic energies, this method determines the relic's capacity to influence or record mental impressions.

    - **Outcomes**:
      - Psionic Level 0 to 25: No attributes ruled out
      - Psionic Level 26 to 60: Rule out "Observer Stone"
      - Psionic Level 61 to 100: No attributes ruled out
