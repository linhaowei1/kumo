# Guidebook on Ancient Relics: Attributes and Examination Methods

## Introduction

The study of ancient relics involves understanding enigmatic artifacts and the mysteries they hold. This guidebook provides an insightful overview of key relic attributes and the methods used to examine and evaluate them. Importantly, through the examination process, we aim to exclude certain attributes based on the outcomes observed.

## Attributes of Ancient Relics

1. **Forbidden Seal**: This attribute is often associated with powerful and dangerous restrictions intended to prevent access or interaction. The seal is shrouded in mystery and caution is advised due to potential forbidden magics.

2. **Gravity Flux**: Relics with this attribute exhibit unusual gravitational phenomena, affecting weight, balance, or spatial orientation. These fluxes can be subtle or intense, requiring careful measurement and consideration.

3. **Primordial Seal**: This attribute denotes relics believed to be tied to ancient elemental forces or cosmic origins. Primordial Seals are associated with the underlying energies that govern natural laws.

4. **Cursed Inscription**: Relics bearing this attribute are marked by inscriptions that convey a curse or dark influence. These inscriptions often hold malignant intent and require careful handling.

## Examination Methods and Activation Steps

To identify and evaluate the attributes of relics, the following examination methods and activation steps are employed:

1. **Inscription Deciphering**
   - Involves analyzing any scripts or runes inscribed on the relic.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **Illegible Runes**: Rules out **Cursed Inscription** and **Forbidden Seal** as possible attributes.
     - **Partial Decipher**: Does not rule out any attributes.
     - **Clear Translation**: Does not rule out any attributes.

2. **Ethereal Distortion Measurement**
   - Measures ethereal energy distortions or anomalies present around the relic.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **(0, 25)**: Does not rule out any attributes.
     - **(26, 75)**: Rules out **Gravity Flux** as a potential attribute.
     - **(76, 100)**: Does not rule out any attributes.

3. **Elemental Reaction Test**
   - Tests for elemental reactions when the relic is exposed to elemental influences or disturbances.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **Dormant Reaction**: Rules out **Primordial Seal** as an attribute.
     - **Minor Elemental Activity**: Does not rule out any attributes.
     - **Extreme Elemental Surge**: Does not rule out any attributes.

4. **Forbidden Grimoire Reference**
   - Compares the relic's features or inscriptions against historical texts and grimoires.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **No Relevant Texts**: Rules out **Forbidden Seal**.
     - **Potential Match**: Does not rule out any attributes.
     - **Exact Grimoire Citation**: Does not rule out any attributes.

5. **Demon Marker Exorcism**
   - Checks for demonic presence indicators attached to the relic, and attempts their removal.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **Marker Expelled**: Does not rule out any attributes.
     - **Residual Corruption**: Rules out **Cursed Inscription**.
     - **No Demonic Trace**: Does not rule out any attributes.

6. **Hex Stabilization Attempt**
   - Attempts to stabilize any hexes present on the relic.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **Hex Collapsed**: Rules out **Cursed Inscription**.
     - **Partial Stabilization**: Does not rule out any attributes.
     - **Stable Arcane Field**: Does not rule out any attributes.

## Conclusion

By examining ancient relics through these detailed methods, researchers can meticulously exclude specific attributes based on the outcomes observed. These methods ensure a structured approach to the study of relics, peeling back layers of secrecy to reveal their true nature while ruling out less likely attributes. Remember, the path to understanding these ancient artifacts is paved with caution, research, and a deep respect for the unknown forces they embody.
