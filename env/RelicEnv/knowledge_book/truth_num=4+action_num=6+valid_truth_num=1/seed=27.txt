# Guidebook on Ancient Relics

Welcome to the compendium on ancient relics, a guide to understanding their mysterious attributes and the examination methods used to study them. This guide provides insights into the attributes these relics may have and methods to test or eliminate possibilities concerning these attributes. Each method of examination helps in unraveling the secrets of the relic by potentially ruling out certain attributes when specific outcomes are observed.

## Attributes of Ancient Relics

1. **Celestial Alignment**: This attribute suggests that the relic is linked with celestial bodies and their configurations in the sky. It implies a connection with cosmic forces and their harmonious alignment.

2. **Seismic Resonance**: Indicative of a relic's connection to the Earth’s seismic activities, this attribute denotes the ability of a relic to react or resonate with tectonic movements.

3. **Chaos Bound**: This attribute signifies an intrinsic link to chaotic forces, suggesting that the relic may be influenced or operate under chaotic or unpredictable conditions.

4. **Astral Chart**: Represents a connection to mystical charts mapping out celestial or astral pathways, suggesting the relic aligns with or is guided by cosmic maps or paths.

## Examination Methods and Activation Steps

1. **Astral Gateway Opening**: This method examines the relic’s connection to astral paths. Outcomes range from a low alignment (0-25) where 'Astral Chart' can be ruled out, to states of no alignment (26-100) where no attributes can be definitively excluded.

2. **Celestial Convergence Map**: This method evaluates the relic's celestial alignments:
   - **Inconsistent Alignments**: If observed, 'Celestial Alignment' is ruled out.
   - **Minor Celestial Overlay** and **Perfected Constellation**: These outcomes do not rule out any attributes.

3. **Thunder Impact Testing**: Tests the relic's resonance to simulated seismic events:
   - **High Impact (67-100)**: If this level of resonance is observed, 'Seismic Resonance' is ruled out, meaning this is not an attribute of the relic.

4. **Ancient Oath Invocation**: Involves invoking ancient powers or bonds within the relic:
   - **Oath Not Recognized**: Indicates no attributes are ruled out.
   - **Dormant Binding Triggered**: When this state occurs, 'Chaos Bound' is excluded.
   - **Resonance Achieved**: This outcome does not rule out any attributes.

5. **Star Alignment Test**: Examines the harmonization with celestial configurations:
   - **Misaligned**: Indicates 'Celestial Alignment' is not a feature of the relic.
   - **Partial Convergence**: Results in the ruling out of 'Astral Chart'.
   - **Perfect Astral Match**: No attributes are ruled out.

6. **Celestial Chart Alignment**: This process tests alignment with detailed celestial charts:
   - **Low Alignment (0-40)**: Results in ruling out 'Celestial Alignment'.
   - **Medium to High Alignment (41-100)**: No attributes can be ruled out based on these outcomes.

## Conclusion

When examining ancient relics, the objective is to determine which attributes they lack based on observed outcomes during various tests. Each examination method provides a unique perspective on how the relic interacts with different forces and conditions. By ruling out attributes, researchers can narrow down the possible attributes and better understand the relic's nature and power. This guide clarifies these processes, aiming to assist in your exploration and study of these fascinating artifacts.
