## Utilizing Examination Outcomes

When conducting research, the outcomes of each examination method guide the researcher in excluding certain relic attributes. This systematic elimination process is crucial for narrowing down the identifiers and understanding the true nature of these ancient items. By carefully applying each method and interpreting results, researchers can exclude non-relevant attributes, bringing them closer to the artifact's genuine essence. 

Understanding these outcomes and employing these methods correctly can lead to revelations about ancient cultures, the tools and materials they used, their ceremonial practices, and the lineage of power or knowledge they cherished. This guidebook serves as your comprehensive resource in the noble endeavor of uncovering the mysteries of ancient relics.
