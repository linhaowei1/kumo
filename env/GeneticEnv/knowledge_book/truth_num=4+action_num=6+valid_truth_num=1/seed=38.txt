# Genetic Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Genetic Analysis Guidebook, where we introduce you to some key genetic mutations and the assays commonly used to analyze these mutations. This guide aims to make complex genetic information accessible and understandable. Let's delve into the details of specific genetic mutations and the assays utilized in their analysis.

## Genetic Mutations Overview

1. **G6PD Deficiency Mutation**
   - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a genetic disorder that primarily affects red blood cells, leading to conditions like hemolytic anemia. It is caused by mutations in the G6PD gene, affecting an enzyme important in red blood cell functioning.

2. **FMR1 Gene Expansion**
   - The FMR1 gene is associated with Fragile X syndrome, a genetic disorder resulting from an expansion of CGG repeats in the gene, leading to developmental issues and intellectual disabilities.

3. **CFTR Mutation**
   - Mutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis, a condition affecting the lungs and digestive system. These mutations disrupt the body's ability to maintain the balance of salt and water on cell surfaces.

4. **APC Gene Mutation**
   - Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations are linked to colorectal cancer. These mutations typically result in dysregulation of cell growth and division, leading to cancer.

## Genetic Assays and Results Interpretation

Below are the genetic assays commonly used to detect these mutations and the outcomes used to rule out specific genetic mutations:

### Southern Blot
- **Normal-sized Fragment**
  - When a Southern blot test reveals a normal-sized fragment, the FMR1 gene expansion can be ruled out as a possibility.

- **Expanded Fragment Detected**
  - No mutations are specifically ruled out.

### Enzyme Assay
- **Enzyme Activity (75, 100)**
  - Observing enzyme activity levels between 75 and 100% indicates that G6PD deficiency can be excluded.

- **Enzyme Activity (0, 25)**
  - No mutations are specifically ruled out.

### Protein Truncation Test
- **No Truncated Proteins Detected**
  - When no truncated proteins are detected, APC gene mutation can be ruled out.

- **Truncated Proteins Detected**
  - No mutations are specifically ruled out.

### Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
- **No Variants Detected**
  - The absence of detected variants rules out CFTR mutation.

- **Variants Detected**
  - No mutations are specifically ruled out.

### DNA Sequencing
- **No Mutations Detected**
  - When no mutations are detected, CFTR mutation can be ruled out.

- **Mutations Detected**
  - No mutations are specifically ruled out.

### Sanger Sequencing
- **No Mutations Detected**
  - The CFTR mutation can be excluded when no mutations are detected.

- **Mutations Detected**
  - No mutations are specifically ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guide serves as a foundational reference for understanding some key genetic mutations and the assays employed to analyze them. Each assay and its outcomes provide essential information on ruling out potential mutations. By following this guide, one can approach genetic analysis with clarity and confidence.
