## Introduction to Genetic Mutations

Understanding genetic mutations and the techniques used to analyze them is vital for diagnosing and managing genetic conditions. This guidebook presents a straightforward approach to understanding four specific genetic mutations and the assays used to detect these conditions.

### Genetic Mutations Covered

1. **BRCA2 Mutation**: This mutation is associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. It affects the BRCA2 gene, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair.

2. **SERPINA1 Mutation**: This mutation can lead to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a condition that affects the lungs and liver. It involves the SERPINA1 gene responsible for producing a protein that protects tissues from enzyme damage.

3. **CFTR Mutation**: Mutations in the CFTR gene can cause cystic fibrosis, a condition that affects the lungs and digestive system. This mutation leads to the production of thick and sticky mucus.

4. **HTT Gene Expansion**: This involves an abnormal expansion of repeats in the HTT gene, resulting in Huntingtonâ€™s disease, a progressive brain disorder.

## Genetic Assays

Several assays are employed to identify genetic mutations. Each assay provides specific information, sometimes allowing us to rule out certain mutations based on the results.

### Southern Blot

- **Normal-sized fragment observed**: If the Southern blot shows a normal-sized fragment, HTT gene expansion can be ruled out since this expansion typically causes an increase in fragment size.

### Next-generation Sequencing (NGS)

- **No variants detected**: When NGS does not find any variants, it rules out the presence of CFTR mutations and BRCA2 mutations. This is because variants are expected if these mutations were present.

### High-resolution Melt Analysis (HRM)

- **No melting curve abnormalities**: The absence of melting curve abnormalities in HRM suggests the CFTR mutation is unlikely, as mutations would typically alter the melting curve.

### Tandem Repeat PCR

- **Repeat size between 0 and 30**: If the tandem repeat size is within this range, HTT gene expansion can be ruled out since expansions due to this mutation usually result in larger repeat sizes.

### Enzyme Assay

- **Enzyme levels between 75 and 100**: If enzyme levels fall within this normal range, the presence of a SERPINA1 mutation is unlikely, as this would typically influence enzyme activity levels.

### Splice-site Analysis

- **No splicing abnormalities detected**: With no splicing abnormalities, CFTR mutation can be ruled out, as such mutations often cause disruptions in normal splicing processes.

## Conclusion

By understanding the relationships between genetic mutations and assay outcomes, one can effectively rule out potential mutations based on specific test results. This guide aims to present these connections clearly, allowing for accurate genetic analysis and assisting in the diagnosis of genetic conditions.
