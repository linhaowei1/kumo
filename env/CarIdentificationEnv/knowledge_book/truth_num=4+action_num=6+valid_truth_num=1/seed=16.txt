# Automotive Part Identification Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to assist in identifying automotive parts by associating specific test outcomes with car manufacturers. We focus on four main car manufacturers—Mazda, Ferrari, Opel, and Fiat—and use a series of tests to help rule out potential manufacturers based on the outcomes observed. The goal is to streamline the identification process through elimination.

## Car Manufacturers Overview

1. **Mazda**: A Japanese manufacturer known for its innovative design and engineering, particularly in composite materials and unique etching processes.

2. **Ferrari**: An Italian luxury sports car manufacturer with a prestigious reputation, often recognized for its unique pattern etching and exclusive proprietary fasteners.

3. **Opel**: A German automobile company that provides reliable and efficient vehicles, often participating in titanium alloy experimentation and unique etching practices.

4. **Fiat**: Another renowned Italian manufacturer known for producing versatile vehicles that might involve proprietary fastening systems and titanium alloy components.

- **Weight (3.0 - 5.0 kg)**:
  - Rule Out: **Fiat, Mazda, Opel**

## Conclusion

By following the outlined tests and rule-out criteria, an individual can systematically exclude certain car manufacturers from consideration. This method provides a clear path to identifying the origins of automotive parts based on specific test outcomes. The comprehensive approach ensures accurate and efficient part identification, reducing uncertainty and improving decision-making processes.
