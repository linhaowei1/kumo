# Automotive Part Identification Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to assist in identifying automotive parts by analyzing specific characteristics and test outcomes. Understanding these outcomes helps rule out certain car manufacturers based on the parts' attributes. The car manufacturers covered in this guide are Infiniti, Citroën, SAIC Motor, and Mini.

## Car Manufacturers

- **Infiniti**: A luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker Nissan.
- **Citroën**: A French automobile manufacturer, part of the Stellantis group.
- **SAIC Motor**: A Chinese state-owned automotive design and manufacturing company, often producing vehicles in partnerships with global brands.
- **Mini**: A British automotive marque owned by BMW and known for producing small, iconic cars.

## Tests and Outcomes

Below are detailed explanations of the tests used in automotive part identification and the outcomes that determine which manufacturers are excluded.

### 1. Weight Measurement

This test determines the weight range of a part, which can be used to rule out certain manufacturers.

- **Weight Range (3.0 - 5.0 kg)**: If a part falls within this weight range, it indicates that Citroën, SAIC Motor, and Infiniti should be ruled out. Mini remains a potential source.

### 2. Thread Type Analysis

This test assesses the type of threading used on a component.

- **BSP Threads**: If a part features BSP (British Standard Pipe) threads, Citroën, SAIC Motor, and Infiniti are eliminated as possible manufacturers. Mini is not excluded.

### 3. Part Size Specifications

Size measurements are crucial for narrowing down manufacturer possibilities.

- **Size Range (30.0 - 50.0 cm)**: Parts within this size range allow us to rule out Citroën, SAIC Motor, and Infiniti. Mini may still be considered the manufacturer.

### 4. Wiring Color Code Analysis

Analysis of the color codes used in wiring provides insights into potential manufacturers.

- **Unique Color Codes**: If unique color coding is observed, it rules out Citroën, SAIC Motor, and Infiniti. Only Mini remains a candidate.

### 5. Serial Number Sequence

The range of serial numbers can be significant in identifying or excluding manufacturers.

- **Range (0 - 50,000)**: Serial numbers within this range suggest excluding Citroën, SAIC Motor, and Infiniti. Mini is not ruled out by this finding.

### 6. Heat Treatment Signature

This test evaluates the heat treatment applied to a part during its production, which impacts its durability and performance.

- **Advanced Heat Treatment**: The observation of advanced heat treatment as a signature leads to the exclusion of Citroën, SAIC Motor, and Infiniti. Hence, Mini remains as a non-excluded manufacturer.

## Conclusion

By applying these tests and interpreting the results, we accurately narrow down the potential manufacturers of automotive parts. Through exclusion, we effectively identify which manufacturers are not responsible for producing a specific part. This approach is crucial for anyone in the automotive industry looking to accurately identify parts and their origins.
