# Automotive Part Identification Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to aid in the identification of automotive parts by ruling out certain car manufacturers through a series of tests. By observing the results of specific tests, it is possible to exclude particular manufacturers, helping you narrow down the possibilities. In this guide, we will introduce the car manufacturers involved, detail the specific tests, and explain how test outcomes can be used to eliminate options.

## Car Manufacturers

1. **Buick**: Known for producing luxury vehicles with refined styling and technology.
2. **SAIC Motor**: A leading Chinese automotive manufacturer involved in producing a wide range of vehicles, including joint ventures with other brands.
3. **Lamborghini**: An Italian manufacturer renowned for its high-performance sports cars and distinctive design.
4. **Cadillac**: A brand associated with high-end, luxury vehicles featuring the latest innovations and materials.

## Tests and Outcomes

Each test provides specific outcomes that allow us to exclude certain manufacturers from consideration. Below is a detailed explanation of the tests and their related outcomes:

### 1. Material Composition Test
This test analyzes the materials used in automotive parts to identify certain elements or alloys.
- **High Aluminum Content**: Observing this outcome rules out Cadillac.
- **Titanium Alloy Detected**: Observing this outcome rules out Buick, SAIC Motor, and Cadillac.

### 2. Part Size Specifications
This test measures the dimensions of parts, identifying size ranges.
- **(30.0, 50.0)mm**: Observing this outcome rules out Buick, SAIC Motor, and Cadillac.

### 3. RFID Tag Scan
This test checks for the presence and type of RFID tags used in parts.
- **No RFID Found**: Observing this outcome rules out Lamborghini.

### 4. Surface Finish Inspection
This test assesses the surface treatment or finish of the part.
- **Specialized Coatings**: Observing this outcome rules out Buick, SAIC Motor, and Cadillac.

### 5. Wiring Color Code Analysis
This test evaluates the color-coding of wiring systems used in parts.
- **Unique Color Codes**: Observing this outcome rules out SAIC Motor, Buick, Lamborghini, and Cadillac.
- **Simplified Color Codes**: Observing this outcome rules out Lamborghini.

### 6. Thread Type Analysis
This test identifies the threading used in mechanical connections.
- **BSP Threads**: Observing this outcome rules out SAIC Motor, Buick, Lamborghini, and Cadillac.

## Conclusion

By performing these tests and analyzing their outcomes, you can efficiently rule out certain car manufacturers from the pool of potential sources for an automotive part. This guidebook provides a structured approach to decoding the origins of automotive components, ensuring precise identification based on material properties and part specifications.
