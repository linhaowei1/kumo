# Automotive Part Identification Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of how to identify automotive parts by ruling out certain car manufacturers based on specific tests and their outcomes. We cover four manufacturers: SsangYong, Infiniti, Porsche, and Land Rover. Utilizing six tests, we provide clear criteria to eliminate manufacturers based on observed outcomes.

## Car Manufacturers

- **SsangYong**: A South Korean automobile manufacturer known for producing SUVs and off-road vehicles.
- **Infiniti**: The luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker Nissan, producing high-end vehicles.
- **Porsche**: A German automobile manufacturer specializing in high-performance sports cars, SUVs, and sedans.
- **Land Rover**: A British brand focused on producing four-wheel-drive vehicles, including SUVs and luxury off-road vehicles.

## Tests and Their Interpretation

### 1. Part Number Cross-Reference
This test involves evaluating the format of the part numbers.

- **Numeric Format**: If the part number is purely numeric, Porsche is ruled out.
- **Alphanumeric Format**: If the part number is alphanumeric, Infiniti is ruled out.
- **Letter Prefix Format**: No exclusions apply.
- **Symbolic Codes**: No exclusions apply.

### 2. Paint Thickness Measurement
This test measures the thickness of paint on the part, where different measurements can rule out certain manufacturers.

- **0 to 100 micrometers**: If the paint thickness falls within this range, Land Rover and Infiniti are ruled out.
- **100 to 200 micrometers**: No exclusions apply.
- **200 to 500 micrometers**: If within this range, SsangYong and Porsche are ruled out.

### 3. Language Used in Markings
This test identifies the language used in the markings on parts to rule out manufacturers.

- **English**: No exclusions apply.
- **German**: No exclusions apply.
- **Japanese**: If Japanese markings are present, SsangYong, Land Rover, and Porsche are ruled out.

### 4. Part Size Specifications
This test involves the measurement of part sizes in millimeters.

- **0.0 to 10.0 mm**: No exclusions apply.
- **10.0 to 20.0 mm**: No exclusions apply.
- **20.0 to 30.0 mm**: No exclusions apply.
- **30.0 to 50.0 mm**: If the size falls in this range, SsangYong, Land Rover, and Infiniti are ruled out.

### 5. Thread Type Analysis
This test determines the type of threads used on the parts.

- **UNF Threads**: No exclusions apply.
- **Metric Threads**: No exclusions apply.
- **BSP Threads**: If BSP threads are used, SsangYong, Land Rover, Infiniti, and Porsche are ruled out.

### 6. Connector Pin Configuration
This test analyzes the configuration of connector pins.

- **Standard Configuration**: No exclusions apply.
- **Custom Configuration**: If the configuration is custom, SsangYong, Land Rover, Infiniti, and Porsche are ruled out.
- **Simplified Configuration**: No exclusions apply.

## Conclusion

This guidebook outlines how to use specific tests to rule out certain car manufacturers based on the observed outcomes. By carefully performing these tests and documenting the results, you can narrow down the possible manufacturers associated with a given automotive part.
