# Automotive Part Identification Guidebook

Welcome to the Automotive Part Identification Guidebook. This resource is designed to help you identify the origins of automotive parts by assessing a variety of characteristics and tests. Through systematic analysis, you can effectively determine which car manufacturers are excluded based on the observed results. Here, we explore four prominent car manufacturers: Kia, Buick, SsangYong, and Jeep, along with several tests that help to distinguish between them.

## Car Manufacturers Overview

1. **Kia**: Known for producing affordable and reliable vehicles, often featuring a blend of modern design and functionality.

2. **Buick**: A historically premium brand, Buick is noted for combining luxury with performance and often incorporates advanced technology in its vehicles.

3. **SsangYong**: This South Korean manufacturer is recognized for its SUVs and crossovers, offering robust vehicles with off-road capabilities.

4. **Jeep**: Famous for its rugged, off-road vehicles, Jeep emphasizes durability and a powerful performance across various terrains.

## Identification Tests and Outcomes

We employ several tests to determine the origin of parts by excluding specific manufacturers based on test results:

### 1. Serial Number Sequence

- **(0, 50000)**: When a serial number falls within this range, Buick and SsangYong are excluded.
- **(50000, 200000)**: No manufacturers are excluded based on this range.
- **(200000, 1000000)**: No exclusions apply here.

### 2. Thread Type Analysis

- **UNF Threads**: No exclusions apply; any manufacturer can use these threads.
- **Metric Threads**: Jeep parts do not use these threads.
- **BSP Threads**: Buick, Kia, and SsangYong parts do not employ these threads.

### 3. Assembly Plant Code Identification

- **Plant Code A**: No exclusions apply when this plant code is observed.
- **Plant Code B**: Jeep parts are not produced with this plant code.
- **Plant Code C**: No exclusions associated with this plant code.
- **Unknown Plant Code**: No exclusions apply for unknown codes.

### 4. Language Used in Markings

- **English**: No manufacturer is excluded when markings are in English.
- **German**: No exclusions are relevant when German markings are present.
- **Japanese**: Buick, Kia, and SsangYong parts are not marked in Japanese.

### 5. Plastic Type Identification

- **ABS Plastic**: No exclusions are made for parts using ABS Plastic.
- **Polycarbonate**: Jeep parts do not use Polycarbonate.
- **Carbon Fiber Reinforced**: Buick, Kia, and SsangYong do not utilize this material.

### 6. Metric vs. Imperial Measurements

- **Metric Measurements**: Jeep does not use exclusively Metric Measurements.
- **Imperial Measurements**: Buick, Kia, and SsangYong are excluded if Imperial Measurements are used.
- **Mixed Measurements**: No exclusions are defined for mixed measurement use.

## Conclusion

By understanding the exclusion criteria provided for each test, you can effectively narrow down the origin possibilities of an automotive part. Utilize this guide to navigate through various automotive part identifiers, keeping in mind that exclusion is the key, not confirmation, in narrowing down the potential manufacturer.
