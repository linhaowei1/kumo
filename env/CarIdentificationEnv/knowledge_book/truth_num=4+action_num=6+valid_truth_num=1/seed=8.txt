# Automotive Part Identification Guidebook

Welcome to the Automotive Part Identification Guidebook. This resource is designed to assist you in identifying the manufacturer of automotive parts through a series of tests. By understanding the outcomes of these tests, you can effectively rule out certain manufacturers, narrowing down the possibilities for accurate identification. In this guidebook, we focus on four major car manufacturers: **Holden, Mazda, Cadillac,** and **Peugeot**. We will also discuss six key tests that aid in the identification process.

## Car Manufacturers

1. **Holden**: An iconic Australian automotive brand known for its distinct vehicles.
2. **Mazda**: A Japanese manufacturer recognized for its innovative designs and engineering excellence.
3. **Cadillac**: An American luxury vehicle brand under General Motors, celebrated for its premium cars.
4. **Peugeot**: A French automobile brand that offers style and performance, known for its elegant and efficient vehicles.

## Identification Tests

### 1. Manufacturing Date Code Analysis

This test analyzes the manufacturing date codes on parts to determine their production timeframe.

- **Pre-2010, 2010-2015, 2016-2020**: No specific manufacturer is ruled out during these periods.
- **Post-2020**: If the part is manufactured after 2020, Holden can be ruled out as a potential manufacturer.

### 2. Language Used in Markings

This test identifies the language used in markings on the part, which provides clues about its origin.

- **English and German**: No manufacturers are ruled out based on these languages.
- **Japanese**: Observing Japanese in markings allows you to rule out Cadillac and Peugeot as possible manufacturers.

### 3. Thread Type Analysis

This test examines the type of threads on parts.

- **UNF Threads and Metric Threads**: All manufacturers remain possible since none are ruled out.
- **BSP Threads**: If BSP threads are found, you can rule out Mazda, Cadillac, and Peugeot.

### 4. Part Number Cross-Reference

This test involves comparing part numbers to known formats used by manufacturers.

- **Numeric Format and Symbolic Codes**: These do not rule out any specific manufacturers.
- **Alphanumeric Format**: Observing this format allows you to exclude Mazda.
- **Letter Prefix Format**: If a letter prefix format is found, Cadillac can be ruled out.

### 5. Serial Number Sequence

This test looks at the sequence of serial numbers to identify manufacturer relevance.

- **(0, 50000)**: A serial number within this range rules out Mazda and Cadillac.
- **(50000, 200000), (200000, 1000000)**: No manufacturers are ruled out within these ranges.

### 6. Part Size Specifications

This test measures the physical dimensions of the part to align with typical manufacturer specifications.

- **(0.0, 10.0), (10.0, 20.0), (20.0, 30.0)**: These sizes retain all manufacturers as possible candidates.
- **(30.0, 50.0)**: Parts within this size range rule out Mazda, Cadillac, and Peugeot.

By conducting these tests systematically, you can effectively narrow down the possible manufacturers and enhance accuracy in automotive part identification. Each rule-out rule was designed to assist in excluding manufacturers where applicable, streamlining your search for the correct origin of the vehicle part.
