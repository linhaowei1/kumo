# Automotive Part Identification Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to aid in the identification of automotive parts by detailing tests that can indicate the likely manufacturers by ruling out certain possibilities. This exclusion method helps narrow down the origins of parts based on various characteristics observed through testing. Below, we introduce the relevant car manufacturers followed by a detailed guide on each test and its outcomes.

## Car Manufacturers

### Lamborghini
An esteemed manufacturer known for its high-performance luxury sports cars. The design emphasis is on unique styling and cutting-edge technology.

### Honda
A globally recognized manufacturer producing a wide range of vehicles notable for their reliability, fuel efficiency, and innovative engineering.

### Volkswagen
A leading automotive company with a strong presence worldwide, known for its commitment to quality, innovation, and the production of versatile vehicles.

### Mahindra
An Indian multinational corporation with a focus on durable, utility-oriented vehicles, often catering to both domestic and global markets.

## Tests and Outcomes

Below are the tests used to identify automotive part manufacturers by observing outcomes that exclude specific manufacturers from consideration.

### Compliance Marking Verification
This test involves verifying the compliance markings on parts, such as CE Marks or E-Marks.

- **CE Mark**: Observing this mark rules out Mahindra, Honda, Lamborghini, and Volkswagen.
- **UL Listed**: There are no manufacturers excluded as none correlate with this outcome.
- **E-Mark**: Observing this mark rules out Mahindra, Lamborghini, and Volkswagen.

### Wiring Color Code Analysis
Examines the wiring color codes to determine the manufacturer.

- **Standardized Color Codes**: Observing standardized color codes rules out Volkswagen.
- **Unique Color Codes**: If unique color codes are present, Mahindra, Honda, and Lamborghini are excluded.
- **Simplified Color Codes**: Observing simplified color codes rules out Lamborghini.

### Paint Thickness Measurement
This test assesses the thickness of paint on automotive parts to deduce the manufacturer.

- **200-500 microns**: If the paint thickness falls within this range, then Mahindra, Honda, Lamborghini, and Volkswagen are all ruled out.

### Surface Finish Inspection
Involves examining the surface finish to identify the manufacturer.

- **High Gloss Finish**: No manufacturers are excluded because high gloss does not apply to any listed manufacturers.
- **Matte Finish**: No exclusions apply as matte finishes do not correspond with the manufacturers.
- **Specialized Coatings**: Observing specialized coatings rules out Mahindra, Honda, and Volkswagen.

### Connector Pin Configuration
Ascertains the configuration of connector pins on parts.

- **Standard Configuration**: There are no manufacturers excluded with a standard configuration.
- **Custom Configuration**: An observed custom configuration rules out Mahindra, Honda, Lamborghini, and Volkswagen.
- **Simplified Configuration**: No manufacturers are excluded with a simplified configuration.

### Serial Number Sequence
Reviews serial number sequences to determine the manufacturer.

- **0-50000**: If the serial number falls within this range, it rules out Mahindra and Lamborghini.
- **200000-1000000**: Serial numbers in this range rule out Lamborghini.

By understanding these tests and their outcomes, identifying the origins of automotive parts becomes a streamlined process through exclusion, effectively narrowing the field of potential manufacturers based on observed characteristics.
