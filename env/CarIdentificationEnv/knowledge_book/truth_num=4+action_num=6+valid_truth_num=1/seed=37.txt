## Automotive Part Identification Guidebook

## Introduction

Understanding the intricacies of automotive part identification can be challenging. This guidebook is designed to help you navigate the process by outlining key car manufacturers and the tests necessary for accurate identification. We'll cover four prominent car manufacturers—Geely, Toyota, Renault, and Ram—and explain the various tests used to identify parts accurately. Importantly, we’ll highlight how these tests can help us eliminate certain manufacturers from consideration based on specific outcomes.

## Car Manufacturers

### Geely
Geely is a well-known automobile manufacturer that typically uses proprietary design elements in its parts. However, Geely shares some common features with other manufacturers, which can complicate identification without proper testing.

### Toyota
Toyota is a global leader in vehicle manufacturing, recognized for using various standard and proprietary components. Identifying Toyota parts often involves specific tests to distinguish them from parts by other manufacturers.

### Renault
Renault is a major player in the automotive industry, operating worldwide with a wide range of vehicles. Like Toyota, Renault parts may present proprietary features, necessitating detailed testing for accurate identification.

### Ram
Ram is uniquely different from the others in that it predominantly uses metric fasteners, setting itself apart in specific tests like fastener type identification.

- **High Gloss Finish**
  - **Excluded Manufacturers:** None
- **Matte Finish**
  - **Excluded Manufacturers:** None
- **Specialized Coatings**
  - **Excluded Manufacturers:** Toyota, Renault, Geely

### 6. Thermo-Resistant Coating Analysis
This test identifies the level of thermal resistance in coatings to exclude manufacturers.

- **Standard Coating**
  - **Excluded Manufacturers:** Toyota
- **Advanced Coating**
  - **Excluded Manufacturers:** None
- **No Coating**
  - **Excluded Manufacturers:** None
