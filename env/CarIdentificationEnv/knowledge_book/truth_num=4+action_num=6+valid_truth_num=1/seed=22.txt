# Automotive Part Identification Guidebook

## Introduction

Welcome to the Automotive Part Identification Guidebook. This guide aims to assist in identifying car manufacturers based on specific tests and their outcomes. Understanding these relationships will help you exclude certain manufacturers based on observed test results, aiding in accurate identification or verification.

The following sections introduce four significant car manufacturers and a series of tests used in the identification process. By applying these tests, we can systematically rule out manufacturers that do not match the observed outcomes.

## Car Manufacturers

1. **BYD**
   - Known for innovation in electric vehicles and energy solutions.

2. **Kia**
   - A prominent global brand recognized for its reliability and value in vehicles.

3. **Jaguar**
   - A luxury automotive brand known for sophisticated designs and engineering.

4. **Tesla**
   - Pioneers in electric vehicle technology with a focus on cutting-edge innovation.
