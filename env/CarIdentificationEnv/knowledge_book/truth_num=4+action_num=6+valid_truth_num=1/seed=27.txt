# Automotive Part Identification Guidebook

This guidebook serves as a comprehensive resource for identifying automotive parts from major car manufacturers using a series of tests. The focus is on ruling out specific manufacturers based on the outcomes of each test. Below, youâ€™ll find an introduction to the car manufacturers and detailed explanations of each test, along with guidance on how the test outcomes help in the identification process.

## Car Manufacturers Overview

- **Audi**: Known for its precision engineering and advanced technology, Audi parts often encompass unique identifiers that are universal across its models.
  
- **Ferrari**: Renowned for its luxurious sports cars, Ferrari parts are often marked with detailed symbolic codes and have distinctive design elements.
  
- **Kia**: A brand recognized for its reliability and affordability, Kia parts may share common compliance standards but have unique proprietary designs.
  
- **Rolls-Royce**: Synonymous with elegance and high-end features, Rolls-Royce parts exhibit traditional craftsmanship and exclusive specifications.

## Tests and Outcomes

### 1. Part Number Cross-Reference

This test examines the format of part numbers to exclude manufacturers based on their standard coding practices.

- **Numeric Format**: If a numeric format is observed, rule out **Audi** and **Rolls-Royce** as potential manufacturers.
- **Symbolic Codes**: When symbolic codes are present, exclude **Ferrari**.

### 2. Serial Number Sequence

By analyzing the sequence of serial numbers, this test helps eliminate certain manufacturers based on typical ranges they implement.

- **Range (0, 50000)**: Rule out **Audi**, **Ferrari**, and **Rolls-Royce** if the serial number falls within this range.
- **Range (200000, 1000000)**: Exclude **Ferrari** and **Rolls-Royce** if the serial number is within this range.

### 3. Compliance Marking Verification

This test involves checking for specific compliance markings, essential for safety and regulatory standards, to rule out non-compliant manufacturers.

- **CE Mark**: If the CE Mark is present, rule out **Audi**, **Ferrari**, **Rolls-Royce**, and **Kia**.
- **E-Mark**: Similarly, exclude **Audi**, **Ferrari**, **Rolls-Royce**, and **Kia** when an E-Mark is observed.

### 4. Thread Type Analysis

This involves examining the type of threads present on the part, which helps to eliminate manufacturers based on their threading standards.

- **UNF Threads**: Rule out **Audi** if UNF threads are discovered.
- **BSP Threads**: Exclude **Audi**, **Ferrari**, **Rolls-Royce**, and **Kia** when BSP threads are detected.

### 5. Fastener Type Identification

Identifying the type of fasteners assists in excluding certain manufacturers based on their use of proprietary fastening systems.

- **Imperial Threads**: Rule out **Audi**, **Ferrari**, **Rolls-Royce**, and **Kia** if imperial threads are identified.
- **Proprietary Fasteners**: Similarly, exclude **Audi**, **Ferrari**, **Rolls-Royce**, and **Kia** for proprietary fasteners.

### 6. Paint Thickness Measurement

This test measures the thickness of the paint to help eliminate manufacturers based on typical ranges they apply.

- **Range (0, 100)**: If the paint thickness falls within this range, rule out **Audi**.
- **Range (200, 500)**: Exclude **Ferrari**, **Rolls-Royce**, and **Kia** when the paint thickness is within this range.

Each test in this guide is critical in narrowing down the potential origins of automotive parts by eliminating options systematically. Follow the outcomes and exclusion rules carefully to ensure reliable identification.
