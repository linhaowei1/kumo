# Automotive Part Identification Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook serves as an essential tool for identifying automotive parts for various car manufacturers, specifically focusing on Mini, Mazda, Kia, and Toyota. To aid in accurate part identification, several tests are outlined, each capable of ruling out certain manufacturers based on specific test outcomes. Understanding these relationships is crucial for professionals in automotive maintenance, repair, and manufacturing.

## Car Manufacturers Overview

- **Mini**: Known for its iconic compact vehicles, Mini employs specific numeric formats for part numbers and has distinct identifiers across various components.

- **Mazda**: Recognized for sporty and efficient cars, Mazda utilizes alphanumeric part numbers and has unique serial number sequencing to distinguish its parts.

- **Kia**: A manufacturer popular for its reliability and affordability, Kia shares some tests and part configurations with other manufacturers but retains distinct features.

- **Toyota**: Prominent for its wide range of reliable vehicles, Toyota is noted for its use of alphanumeric part numbers, standard coatings, specific plant codes, and various part specifications.

## Tests and Outcomes

### 1. Part Number Cross-Reference
This test analyzes the format of part numbers. The outcomes include:

- **Numeric Format**: This outcome rules out Mini as a possibility, as they exclusively utilize this format.

- **Alphanumeric Format**: Observing this format excludes Toyota and Mazda from consideration, as their part numbers fit this category.

- **Letter Prefix Format**: Not utilized by any of the listed manufacturers.

- **Symbolic Codes**: Not applicable for the specified manufacturers.

### 2. Serial Number Sequence
This test evaluates the serial number ranges assigned to parts:

- **Range (0, 50000)**: If a serial number falls within this range, Mazda is eliminated from being responsible, as they use this range.

- **Range (50000, 200000) & Range (200000, 1000000)**: No manufacturers are eliminated as possibilities in these ranges.

### 3. Thermo-Resistant Coating Analysis
This test determines the level of heat resistance in coatings:

- **Standard Coating**: When this outcome is noted, Toyota is excluded, as they use this coating variant.

- **Advanced Coating & No Coating**: These outcomes do not apply to the specified manufacturers.

### 4. Assembly Plant Code Identification
This test examines the production plant codes associated with parts:

- **Plant Code A**: The presence of this code rules out Toyota, as this is their identified plant code.

- **Plant Code B, C & Unknown Plant Code**: These codes are not linked to any of the specified manufacturers.

### 5. Part Size Specifications
This test assesses the dimensions of parts:

- **Size Range (0.0, 10.0)**: No manufacturers are ruled out by observing this size.

- **Size Range (10.0, 20.0)**: Parts in this size range exclude Toyota from consideration, as they fit this specification.

- **Size Range (20.0, 30.0)**: No exclusions are applicable.

- **Size Range (30.0, 50.0)**: Observing this size eliminates Toyota, Mazda, and Kia, as their parts fit within this range.

### 6. Connector Pin Configuration
This test identifies the setup of connector pins:

- **Standard Configuration**: This configuration does not eliminate any manufacturer.

- **Custom Configuration**: If detected, Toyota, Mazda, and Kia are excluded since they apply this configuration.

- **Simplified Configuration**: Not applicable to the specified manufacturers.

## Conclusion
This guide provides a systematic approach to ruling out car manufacturers based on specific test outcomes. By methodically applying each test and utilizing its findings, professionals can effectively narrow down the possibilities, ensuring precise identification and maintenance of automotive parts.
