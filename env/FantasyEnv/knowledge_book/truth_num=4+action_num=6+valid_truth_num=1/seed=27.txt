# Fantasy Artifacts Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Fantasy Artifacts Analysis Guidebook, a comprehensive manual designed to guide you in identifying and understanding some of the most enigmatic and powerful artifacts within the fantasy realm. This guide will explore four unique artifacts, the tests we employ to study them, and the outcomes you might encounter. Crucially, this guide focuses on ruling out which artifacts do not pertain to specific outcomes during analysis. 

## Fantasy Artifacts

1. **Crystal Ball of Visions**
   - A mysterious orb capable of revealing secrets and visions of times and places hidden from ordinary sight. This artifact is invaluable for seers and oracle practices.

2. **Harp of Harmony**
   - A musical instrument that tunes to the universe's harmonious balance. Its enchanting melodies can soothe spirits, bring peace, and even influence emotions.

3. **Staff of Earth**
   - A potent conduit for elemental power, specifically Earth. This artifact is treasured by druids and geomancers for its ability to command and manipulate the foundational forces of nature.

4. **Lantern of Souls**
   - An eerie lantern believed to safely guide spirits to the afterlife. Its ethereal glow is said to be both a beacon of hope and a ward against malevolent entities.

## Tests and Outcomes

To determine the nature and properties of each artifact, we rely on a series of specialized tests. Each test aims to uncover specific characteristics, which assists in eliminating certain artifacts from consideration when particular outcomes are observed.

### 1. Identify Origin Material
This test categorizes the source material from which the artifact is derived, such as forged metal or natural elements.

- **Forged Metal**: If identified, rule out **Lantern of Souls**, **Crystal Ball of Visions**, and **Harp of Harmony**.
- **Natural Element**: If identified, rule out **Staff of Earth**, **Lantern of Souls**, and **Harp of Harmony**.

### 2. Check for Curses
This critical test determines the presence of malevolent curses attached to an artifact.

- **Curse Detected**: If a curse is found, rule out **Staff of Earth**, **Crystal Ball of Visions**, **Lantern of Souls**, and **Harp of Harmony**. (All are ruled out if a curse is found; no artifacts can be declared curse-free.)

### 3. Gauge Psionic Feedback
This measures the amount of psychic energy feedback an artifact emits, normally recorded in percentage ranges.

- **0 - 40%**: If detected, rule out **Crystal Ball of Visions**.
- **41 - 80% & 81 - 100%**: If detected, no specific artifacts are ruled out.

### 4. Detect Sentient Magic
This test determines whether the artifact holds any sentient magical awareness.

- **Sentient Magic Detected**: If uncovered, rule out **Staff of Earth**, **Crystal Ball of Visions**, and **Harp of Harmony**.
- **No Sentient Magic**: If detected, rule out **Lantern of Souls**.

### 5. Detect Magical Aura
This test examines the intensity of the magical aura surrounding the artifact.

- **0 - 25%**: If detected, rule out **Staff of Earth**.
- **26 - 50%, 51 - 75%, & 76 - 100%**: If detected, no specific artifacts are ruled out.

### 6. Test for Necromantic Essence
This determines whether the artifact contains traces of necromantic energies.

- **Necromantic Essence Present**: If found, rule out **Staff of Earth**, **Crystal Ball of Visions**, and **Harp of Harmony**.
- **No Necromantic Essence**: If absent, rule out **Lantern of Souls**.
