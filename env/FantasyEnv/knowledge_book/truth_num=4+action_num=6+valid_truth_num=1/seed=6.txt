Utilizing a structured set of magical tests, one can discern the properties of these artifacts and differentiate between them. Below, you will find detailed descriptions and analysis guidelines for each of the tests and outcomes used to comprehend these artifacts effectively.

## Fantasy Artifacts

1. **Hammer of the Forge**
   - A legendary tool said to bring life to metal and craft the most exquisite magical items.

2. **Stone of Destiny**
   - An ancient relic believed to hold the power of foresight and the ability to alter fate.

   - A mystical garment that shrouds the wearer in illusions and ethereal protection.

4. **Mask of Deception**
   - An enigmatic mask known to conceal true intentions and identities through complex illusions.

## Tests and Outcomes

### 1. Scan for Illusion Traces

   This test explores the presence of illusionary magic surrounding an artifact. It helps identify those artifacts masquerading their true nature or possessing illusion-based enchantments.

   - **Illusion Traces Found**: Rule out the Stone of Destiny and Hammer of the Forge. These artifacts show signs of illusion traces and can be excluded if this outcome is observed.
   
   - **No Illusion Traces**: Rule out the Mask of Deception and Cloak of Mists. The absence of illusion traces suggests these artifacts are not present, allowing their exclusion.

### 2. Check for Curses

   This test examines artifacts for the presence of curses, which often bring misfortune or bind the user in unwanted ways.

   - **Curse Detected**: Rule out the Stone of Destiny, Hammer of the Forge, and Cloak of Mists. These show signs of cursing and can be excluded under this outcome.
   
   - **No Curse Detected**: Rule out the Mask of Deception. The absence of a curse can be used to rule out this artifact.

### 3. Gauge Psionic Feedback

   This advanced test measures the mental and psychic energy responses from an artifact, indicating its interaction with psionic fields.

   - **Feedback Level 0-40**: Rule out the Stone of Destiny. Only low-level psionic feedback is observed, and this can serve as an exclusion for this artifact.
   
   - **Feedback Level 40-80 and 80-100**: No artifacts to rule out. The lack of significant psionic feedback means no exclusions can be drawn from these ranges.

### 4. Analyze Sonic Resonance

   This test analyzes the vibrational frequency emitted by artifacts, a sign of their underlying magical harmonies.

   - **High Resonance**: Rule out all artifacts—Stone of Destiny, Mask of Deception, Hammer of the Forge, and Cloak of Mists. This is a universal outcome, suggesting no reasonable conclusions can be made as all resonate highly.
   
   - **Low Resonance**: No artifacts to rule out. The absence of low resonance means all artifacts remain possibilities.

### 5. Scrutinize Magical Frequencies

   Magical frequency scrutiny helps identify specific magical signatures indicative of enchantments or protective spells.

   - **Frequency Match Found**: Rule out all artifacts—Stone of Destiny, Mask of Deception, Hammer of the Forge, and Cloak of Mists. The comprehensive frequency matching provides grounds for exclusion.
   
   - **No Frequency Match**: No artifacts to rule out. Lack of matches implies artifacts remain under consideration.

### 6. Detect Life Force

   This complex test investigates the presence of living essence or embedded souls within artifacts.

   - **Living Essence Found**: Rule out all artifacts—Stone of Destiny, Mask of Deception, Hammer of the Forge, and Cloak of Mists. Discovery of life force negates these as significant findings for exclusion.
   
   - **No Living Essence**: No artifacts to rule out. Absence indicates all remain potential candidates for further analysis.
