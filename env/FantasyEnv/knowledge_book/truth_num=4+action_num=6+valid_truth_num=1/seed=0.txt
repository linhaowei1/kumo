Welcome to the Fantasy Artifacts Analysis Guidebook, a comprehensive manual designed to guide you through the identification and classification of mystical artifacts. Understanding these artifacts involves rigorous testing to ascertain their nature and purpose. Below, you will find detailed descriptions of each fantasy artifact and the corresponding tests necessary for their analysis.

## Fantasy Artifacts

1. **Pendant of Luck**
   - This intricate pendant is believed to bestow fortune upon its bearer. It is commonly sought after by adventurers and treasure hunters who wish to improve their fortunes.

2. **Gem of Teleportation**
   - A rare gemstone that can instantly transport its holder to another location. It is prized for its ability to bypass conventional travel limitations.

3. **Bracelet of Protection**
   - Crafted with powerful enchantments, this bracelet offers its wearer formidable defensive capabilities against various threats, both magical and physical.

4. **Crystal of Shadows**
   - A mysterious artifact capable of manipulating shadows, often associated with concealment and clandestine activities.

## Tests and Elimination Criteria

Each artifact can be analyzed using the following scientific tests, which help to narrow down their identity by process of elimination.

### 1. Analyze Energy Emissions
- This test measures the energy emissions emitted by an artifact. If the energy levels fall within certain thresholds, this helps to exclude specific artifacts:
  - **Energy Levels (0 - 50):** Rule out the **Gem of Teleportation** as it does not exhibit low energy emissions.
  - **Energy Levels (50 - 100):** Rule out the **Pendant of Luck**, which is known for higher energy output.

### 2. Inspect Dimensional Anchors
- Dimensional anchors refer to the stability of an artifact within a given space:
  - **Anchors Present:** Rule out the **Bracelet of Protection**, **Crystal of Shadows**, and **Pendant of Luck**, all of which demonstrate stability.
  - **No Anchors:** Rule out the **Gem of Teleportation**, which lacks stable anchoring due to its nature of altering space.

### 3. Assess Magical Stability
- This assessment checks how stable the magical influences within an artifact are:
  - **Stability Range (0 - 50):** Rule out the **Crystal of Shadows**, as it shows unstable magical influence.
  - **Stability Range (50 - 100):** (No artifacts are ruled out at this range for magical stability.)

### 4. Test for Time Distortion
- This test detects any time anomalies linked to an artifact:
  - **Time Distortion Detected:** Rule out all artifacts: **Gem of Teleportation**, **Bracelet of Protection**, **Crystal of Shadows**, and **Pendant of Luck**, as they are all connected to time distortions.
  - **No Time Distortion:** (No artifacts meet this condition.)

### 5. Analyze Symbolic Inscriptions
- This involves deciphering any inscriptions found on the artifact to understand their language origin:
  - **Language of the Elves and Language of the Dwarves:** Rule out all artifacts: **Gem of Teleportation**, **Bracelet of Protection**, **Crystal of Shadows**, and **Pendant of Luck**, as they all display these inscriptions.
  - **Others:** (No artifacts are identified under other languages.)

### 6. Examine Astral Imprint
- The astral imprint indicates the strength of an artifact's connection to astral planes:
  - **Strong Astral Imprint:** Rule out all artifacts: **Gem of Teleportation**, **Bracelet of Protection**, **Crystal of Shadows**, and **Pendant of Luck**, due to their potent astral presence.
  - **Weak Astral Imprint:** (No artifacts show a weak astral imprint.)

## Conclusion

By using this guidebook, you can effectively employ a process of elimination to determine the nature and characteristics of fantasy artifacts based on the test outcomes. Each test rules out specific artifacts under different conditions, aiding in your quest for understanding the mysteries these artifacts hold. Use these guidelines meticulously to unravel the secrets of the magical world.
