# Cloud Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the comprehensive guidebook on cloud analysis. In this guide, we introduce and explain different cloud types and observation methods used to identify and differentiate clouds. The methods and analysis rules presented aim to simplify the understanding of complex cloud formations by providing a systematic approach through exclusion-based observation.

## Cloud Types

1. **Altostratus Radiatus**: This type of cloud is generally characterized by uniform greyish sheets that often cover the entire sky, leading to overcast conditions without much variation in intensity.

2. **Cumulus Radiatus**: These clouds are typically puffy and white with flat bases, often appearing in rows, and indicating fair weather when observed individually or in small groups.

3. **Cirrus Fibratus**: These are thin, wispy clouds found at high altitudes, often resembling horse tails, and are composed mostly of ice crystals, usually appearing during fair weather.

4. **Cumulus Congestus**: Known for their towering, cauliflower-like structures, these cumulus clouds can be indicative of developing thunderstorms, especially when dense and vertically extensive.

## Observation Methods and Exclusion-Based Analysis

To accurately identify cloud types, we utilize a series of observational methods. Each method provides outcomes that help rule out certain cloud types from consideration based on the observed states.

### Moisture Content Evaluation

- **Low Moisture (0-5 g/m³)**: When you find low moisture levels, exclude *Cumulus congestus* and *Cumulus radiatus* as these clouds require higher moisture content.
- **High Moisture (10-20 g/m³)**: Observing high moisture levels rules out *Cirrus fibratus*, as it is typically composed of ice crystals and forms under drier conditions.

### Cloud Stratification Observation

- **Stratified**: Stratified observations indicate a layered structure. This leads to the exclusion of *Cumulus congestus* and *Cumulus radiatus*, which are not typically stratified.
- **Non-Stratified**: When clouds do not appear stratified, *Altostratus radiatus* can be ruled out since it often forms in layers.

### Cloud Particle Type Analysis

- **Ice Crystals**: Observing ice crystals indicates that the clouds are not *Cumulus congestus* or *Cumulus radiatus*, which generally consist of water droplets.
- **Water Droplets**: When water droplets are predominant, rule out *Cirrus fibratus*, as it is mostly ice.

### Cloud Color Observation

- **Grey**: If the clouds appear grey, it excludes *Cirrus fibratus*, which can often appear greyish.
- **Dark Grey**: When clouds appear dark grey, rule out both *Altostratus radiatus* and *Cirrus fibratus*, which are typically not dark grey.

### Cloud Thickness Measurement

- **Thin (0-500m)**: Thin clouds rule out *Cumulus congestus* and *Cumulus radiatus*, which are usually thicker.
- **Thick (1000-5000m)**: Observations of thick clouds indicate ruling out *Cirrus fibratus*, which is generally thin and wispy.

### Cloud Layering Observation

- **Single Layer**: When clouds appear in a single layer, exclude *Cumulus congestus* and *Cumulus radiatus*, often not forming in distinct layers.
- **Multiple Layers**: Observations of multiple layers rule out both *Cumulus congestus* and *Cumulus radiatus* as these clouds typically present a single layered appearance.

By applying these methods and utilizing the exclusion-based outcomes, you can systematically narrow down potential cloud types and build a clearer understanding of the cloud formations observed. Happy cloud watching!
