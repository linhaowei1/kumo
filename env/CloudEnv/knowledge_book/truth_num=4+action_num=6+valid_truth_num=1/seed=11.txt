# Cloud Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to help you understand different cloud types and how to observe and identify them using various meteorological methods. The focus is on four specific cloud types: Nimbostratus praecipitatio, Cirrocumulus castellanus, Altostratus opacus, and Cumulus mediocris. Each cloud type has distinct characteristics, and through observational methods, you can determine which types are unlikely to be present based on specific outcomes.

## Cloud Types Overview

1. **Nimbostratus praecipitatio**: These are thick, gray clouds that often cover the sky like a blanket and are known for bringing continuous, steady precipitation.

2. **Cirrocumulus castellanus**: These high-altitude clouds look like small white patches with castle-like towers, usually indicating fair but cold weather.

3. **Altostratus opacus**: These mid-altitude clouds are dense and cover the sky, which blocks sunlight and often indicates an impending change in weather.

4. **Cumulus mediocris**: Characterized by their cotton-like appearance, these clouds are usually seen in fair weather without significant vertical growth.

## Observation Methods and Rule-Out Criteria

### Cloud Base Temperature

- **Cold (-50 to 0째C)**: If the cloud base temperature is cold, rule out the presence of *Nimbostratus praecipitatio*.
- **Warm (0 to 25째C)**: When the temperature is warm, *Cirrocumulus castellanus* should be ruled out.

### Surface Wind Direction

- **Northerly Winds**: If northerly winds are observed, eliminate the likelihood of *Cumulus mediocris* and *Cirrocumulus castellanus*.
- **Southerly Winds**: With southerly winds, rule out *Nimbostratus praecipitatio* and *Altostratus opacus*.

### Vertical Development Observation

- **Significant Vertical Development**: Observations of significant vertical growth should lead you to rule out *Nimbostratus praecipitatio* and *Altostratus opacus*.
- **Minimal Vertical Development**: If minimal vertical development is noted, eliminate *Cumulus mediocris* as a possibility.

### Precipitation Observation

- **No Precipitation**: If there's no precipitation, this doesn't rule out any specific cloud types.
- **Light Precipitation**: Encountering light precipitation should exclude *Cumulus mediocris* and *Cirrocumulus castellanus*.
- **Heavy Precipitation**: Heavy precipitation is not associated with any exclusions.

### Cloud Top Temperature

- **Very Cold (-80 to -50째C)**: If the cloud tops are very cold, exclude *Nimbostratus praecipitatio* as it is not typically found at such cold temperatures.
- **Moderately Cold (-50 to -20째C)**: Observing moderately cold cloud tops necessitates the exclusion of *Altostratus opacus*.

### Humidity Measurement at Cloud Level

- **Low Humidity (0-40%)**: Low humidity levels correspond to ruling out *Cumulus mediocris*.
- **High Humidity (60-100%)**: High humidity doesn't rule out any specific cloud types.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides a strategic framework for cloud identification through exclusion. By systematically ruling out cloud types based on environmental observations, you can narrow down the possible cloud types present in the sky, enhancing your cloud analysis skills. Use each method and its associated outcomes to make informed decisions about which clouds are unlikely to be present, refining your meteorological assessments effectively.
