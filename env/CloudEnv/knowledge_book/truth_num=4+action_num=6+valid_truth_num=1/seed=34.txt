# Cloud Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Cloud Analysis Guidebook, where we explore various cloud types and the observation methods used to study them. This guide will introduce four unique cloud types and describe how different observation techniques can help us rule out certain cloud formations. Let's dive in!

## Cloud Types

1. **Cumulonimbus incus**
   - These are large, towering clouds often associated with thunderstorms. They have an anvil-shaped top and can reach high altitudes.

2. **Cirrocumulus lenticularis**
   - Appearing as small, fleecy clouds, these often form at high altitudes. They resemble lenticular or lens-shaped patterns, frequently occurring in steady atmospheric conditions.

3. **Cirrus vertebratus**
   - These are thin, wispy, and horizontally spread clouds appearing like vertebrae. They are generally found at high altitudes and indicate stable weather conditions.

4. **Altostratus opacus**
   - These clouds cover the sky uniformly, creating a grey to bluish-grey sheet. They can obscure the sun and typically predict moderate weather changes.

## Observation Methods

1. **Cloud Shape and Structure Analysis**
   - This method involves scrutinizing cloud formations to identify their structural characteristics.
   - Outcomes for this method:
     - **Layered / Stratus-like**: Rules out Cirrus vertebratus, Cirrocumulus lenticularis, Cumulonimbus incus.
     - **Heap / Cumulus-like**: Rules out Cirrus vertebratus, Cirrocumulus lenticularis, Altostratus opacus.
     - **Wispy / Cirrus-like**: Rules out Cumulonimbus incus, Cirrocumulus lenticularis, Altostratus opacus.
     - **Lens-shaped / Lenticular**: Rules out Cirrus vertebratus, Cumulonimbus incus, Altostratus opacus.
     - **Towering / Vertical Development**: Rules out Cirrus vertebratus, Cirrocumulus lenticularis, Altostratus opacus.

2. **Atmospheric Pressure Trend**
   - Observing pressure changes helps determine weather patterns and potential cloud types.
   - Outcomes for this method:
     - **Rising Pressure**: Rules out Cumulonimbus incus.
     - **Falling Pressure**: Rules out Cumulonimbus incus.

3. **Cloud Coverage Measurement**
   - This method evaluates how much of the sky is covered by clouds.
   - Outcomes for this method:
     - **Scattered**: Rules out Cumulonimbus incus, Altostratus opacus.
     - **Overcast**: Rules out Cumulonimbus incus.

4. **Surface Wind Speed**
   - Wind speed near the ground offers insight into cloud presence and movement.
   - Outcomes for this method:
     - **Calm (0-5 km/h)**: Rules out Cumulonimbus incus.
     - **Breezy (5-20 km/h)**: Rules out Altostratus opacus.

5. **Surface Wind Direction**
   - The direction from which the wind blows can influence cloud formation.
   - Outcomes for this method:
     - **Northerly Winds**: Rules out Cirrocumulus lenticularis.
     - **Southerly Winds**: Rules out Altostratus opacus.

6. **Cloud Motion Speed**
   - This measures the speed at which clouds move across the sky.
   - Outcomes for this method:
     - **Slow Movement (0-10 km/h)**: Rules out Cirrus vertebratus, Cirrocumulus lenticularis, Cumulonimbus incus.
     - **Fast Movement (10-50 km/h)**: No cloud types are ruled out.

By using these observation techniques, you can better analyze and understand cloud formations, ruling out possibilities to narrow down the specific cloud type present. Keep observing the skies, and use this guidebook as your resource to identify and categorize the clouds above accurately.
