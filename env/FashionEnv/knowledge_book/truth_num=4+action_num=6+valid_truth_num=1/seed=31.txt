### Fashion Styles or Movements

#### Y2K
Originating from the late 1990s and early 2000s, Y2K fashion is characterized by futuristic and playful elements like glossy fabrics, vibrant colors, and tech-inspired designs. It celebrates a blend of nostalgia and innovation, often seen in items like metallic jackets and baggy pants.

Gothic Lolita is an intricate subculture style emerging from Japan, combining the frilliness of Lolita fashion with the dark aesthetics of gothic influences. This style features ornate clothing with lace, ribbons, and dark color palettes, emphasizing elegance and mystery.

#### Surf and Skate
This style draws its roots from the laid-back and functional clothing typically associated with surfing and skating cultures. Linked with streetwear, it often includes relaxed-fit, durable materials and relaxed styles that suit an active lifestyle.

#### Sporty
Sporty fashion merges athletic wear with everyday outfits, emphasizing comfort and movement. It often includes items such as sneakers, tracksuits, and logo-heavy tops, conveyed in bright hues and sleek designs.

### Assessments & Outcomes

In our fashion analysis, several assessments help in discerning appropriate styles based on different outcomes. Here's how each assessment rules out certain fashion styles:

#### 1. Seasonality Assessment
- **Fall/Winter**: Styles unsuitable for this season include Surf and Skate, as it is more aligned with warmer climates.
- **Spring/Summer** and **Trans-Seasonal** have no exclusions based on this analysis.

#### 2. Emotional Aesthetic Analysis
- **Edgy**: The Sporty style is excluded when this emotional aesthetic is detected, as its infusion of boldness and resilience stands apart from the edginess normally anticipated.
- **Romantic** and **Playful** have no exclusions.

#### 3. Trend Assessment
- **1950 to 1980**: Y2K fashion is ruled out because it references a post-1980's futuristic theme.
- **1980 to 2000** and **2000 to 2020** periods have no exclusions relevant to this analysis.

#### 4. Embellishment Inspection
- **Heavy Embellishments**: Sporty styles are excluded here, as their minimalist approach starkly contrasts with such heavy detailing.
- **Minimal Embellishments**: Gothic Lolita is ruled out, given its preference for elaborate decorations.
- **No Embellishments** requires no specific exclusions.

#### 5. Proportion and Scale Evaluation
- **Oversized Proportions**: Sporty is excluded since its sleek and dynamic designs don't align with oversized fits.
- **Fitted Proportions**: Surf and Skate is excluded when fitted silhouettes are not the focal point.
- **Mixed Proportions** doesn't have specified exclusions.

#### 6. Quality of Craftsmanship
- **7 to 10**: With high craftsmanship scores, Surf and Skate styles are eliminated due to their preference for functional over ornamental detailing.
- Low to mid-level craftsmanship (0 to 3 and 3 to 7) have no other exclusions.
