# Fashion Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of fashion, understanding the intricacies of various styles and movements is crucial. This guidebook aims to provide insights into four distinct fashion styles and movements: Haute Couture, Traditional, Steampunk, and Military. By exploring different assessments, we'll identify which styles can be ruled out under specific conditions, assisting in narrowing down the potential style being analyzed.

## Fashion Styles or Movements

### Haute Couture
Haute Couture represents the height of artisanal craftsmanship in fashion, characterized by exquisite attention to detail and often custom-fitted garments. Originating from the French tradition, this style is synonymous with luxury and exclusivity.

### Traditional
Traditional fashion encapsulates clothing styles that have evolved through generations within a particular culture or region, often emphasizing timeless designs and cultural heritage.

### Steampunk
Steampunk is a retro-futuristic style that combines elements of the Victorian era with speculative technology. This movement is often characterized by brass, leather, and mechanical accessories.

### Military
Military fashion draws inspiration from armed forces attire, often featuring structured silhouettes, earthy color palettes, and functional details such as epaulets and utility pockets.
