# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook introduces the basics of chemical analysis, focusing on the identification and characterization of specific chemical substances through a series of experiments. The substances under investigation include Calcium Carbonate, Ethanol, Acetaldehyde, and Hydrochloric Acid. Various analytical experiments will provide insights into the properties of these substances, allowing for the exclusion of certain substances based on observed outcomes.

## Chemical Substances

1. **Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3)**
   - A commonly occurring inorganic compound found in rocks, shells of marine organisms, and more. It's known for its low solubility in water.

2. **Ethanol (C2H5OH)**
   - A volatile, flammable liquid commonly used as a solvent and in alcoholic beverages. It has a distinct, characteristic odor.

3. **Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO)**
   - An organic compound with a sharp, fruity smell. It's an intermediate in the process of alcohol metabolism.

4. **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)**
   - A strong, corrosive acid commonly used in laboratory settings and industrial processes. It's known for its high reactivity.

## Experiments and Observed Outcomes

The experiments designed here aim to differentiate these substances by identifying incompatible outcomes and thereby ruling them out.

### 1. Titration with NaOH
- **Experiment Description**: This involves the addition of a base, NaOH, to a solution to determine the concentration of an acid or other reactive substances through neutralization.
- **Observed Outcomes**:
  - If there is **no significant change**, Hydrochloric Acid can be excluded as it would typically react with NaOH.

### 2. Mass Spectrometry Peak
- **Experiment Description**: Mass spectrometry measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions to identify chemical substances.
- **Observed Outcomes**:
  - For an **m/z 31 abundant** peak, no specific substances may be ruled out.
  - If there are **no distinct peaks**, both Ethanol and Acetaldehyde can be excluded, as they would typically show distinct peaks.

### 3. Boiling Point Measurement
- **Experiment Description**: This test determines the temperature at which a substance transitions from liquid to gas.
- **Observed Outcomes**:
  - For boiling points within **50 - 150°C**, this measurement allows the exclusion of Ethanol and Acetaldehyde.
  
### 4. Density Measurement
- **Experiment Description**: This experiment involves measuring the mass per unit volume of a substance.
- **Observed Outcomes**:
  - A density within **0.8 - 1.0 g/cm³** allows the exclusion of Calcium Carbonate, which typically demonstrates a higher density.

### 5. pH Test
- **Experiment Description**: A pH test measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution.
- **Observed Outcomes**:
  - For pH levels between **0 - 3**, Calcium Carbonate can be ruled out.
  - For pH levels between **3 - 7**, both Hydrochloric Acid and Calcium Carbonate can be excluded.

### 6. Conductivity Test
- **Experiment Description**: This involves measuring the ability of a solution to conduct electricity, often related to the presence of ions.
- **Observed Outcomes**:
  - Conductivity values within **0 - 10 µS/cm** indicate that Hydrochloric Acid, which has higher conductivity, can be excluded.

This guide provides a structured approach to deducing the presence of specific chemical substances through a series of definitive analyses and experiments. By systematically applying the exclusion rules, analysts can effectively narrow down the possible substances and better understand the chemical makeup of a sample.
