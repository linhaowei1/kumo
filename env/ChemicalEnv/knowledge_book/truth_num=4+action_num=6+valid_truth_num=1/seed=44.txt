# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to introduce you to a selection of chemical substances and guide you through various experiments used to analyze these substances. By understanding these analyses, you can determine which chemical substances are not present based on the outcome of each experiment.

## Chemical Substances

1. **Formaldehyde**: A simple aldehyde known for its use in manufacturing and embalming. It is a colorless gas at room temperature.
   
2. **Ammonia**: A compound with the formula NH₃, known for its sharp, pungent odor. It is often used in cleaning products and as a fertilizer.

3. **Sodium Chloride (NaCl)**: Commonly known as table salt, it is an ionic compound essential for life but also easily recognizable for its role in seasoning food.

4. **Thiourea**: An organosulfur compound with a sweet odor, used in various industrial applications including photography and textile processing.

## Experiments and Outcomes

### 1. Odor Test

**Objective**: Determine the characteristic odor of a substance to rule out certain chemicals.

- **Pungent** odor rules out **Sodium Chloride**.
- **Sweet** odor rules out **Thiourea** and **Ammonia**.
- **Odorless** results in no exclusions.

### 2. UV-Vis Absorption

**Objective**: Measure absorption within specific UV-visible light spectrums.

- Absorption from **200-250 nm** results in no exclusions.
- Absorption from **250-300 nm** rules out **Sodium Chloride**.

### 3. Polarimetry

**Objective**: Measure the rotation of polarized light.

- Rotation from **-10 to 0 degrees** results in no exclusions.
- Rotation from **0 to 10 degrees** rules out **Sodium Chloride**.

### 4. Solubility in Water

**Objective**: Determine how well a substance dissolves in water.

- **Soluble** results in no exclusions.
- **Partially soluble** rules out **Sodium Chloride**.
- **Insoluble** results in no exclusions.

### 5. Boiling Point Measurement

**Objective**: Measure the temperature at which a substance transitions from a liquid to a gas.

- **0 to 50°C** results in no exclusions.
- **50 to 150°C** rules out **Formaldehyde**.
- **150 to 300°C** results in no exclusions.

### 6. Conductivity Test

**Objective**: Measure the electrical conductivity of a substance in solution.

- Conductivity between **0 to 10 µS/cm** rules out **Sodium Chloride**.
- Conductivity between **10 to 100 µS/cm** results in no exclusions.

## Conclusion

The outcomes from these experiments guide us in excluding substances from consideration based on specific observations. By performing these tests and interpreting the results, you can systematically determine which substances are not present in your sample. Use this guidebook to inform your analysis and ensure accurate chemical identification through process of elimination.
