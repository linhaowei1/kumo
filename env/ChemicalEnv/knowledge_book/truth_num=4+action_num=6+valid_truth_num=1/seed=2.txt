# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Chemical Analysis Guidebook, where we explore the properties and reactions of various chemical substances through a series of carefully designed experiments. This manual will guide you through understanding and analyzing the following chemical substances using specific experimental techniques:

### Chemical Substances
1. **Methanol**: A simple alcohol with a low boiling point and molecular structure characterized by a single hydroxyl group.
2. **Toluene**: An aromatic hydrocarbon known for its sweet smell and use as an industrial feedstock and solvent.
3. **Acetonitrile**: A volatile organic compound often used in the pharmaceutical industry as a solvent.
4. **Decane**: A saturated hydrocarbon that is part of the alkane family, known for its long carbon chain and use in organic chemistry studies.

### Experiments and Analytical Techniques

To analyze these substances, we conduct several experiments and interpret the outcomes to rule out certain chemicals based on their characteristics and reactions. Each experiment is detailed below, along with the implications of their results:

---

#### 1. Reaction with Dilute Base
- **Salt Formation**: If a chemical reacts and forms a salt, the following substances are ruled out:
  - **Decane**
  - **Toluene**
- **No Reaction**: There is no reaction that excludes any of the substances, therefore all remain potential candidates.

---

#### 2. Mass Spectrometry Peak
- **m/z 31 Abundant**: If a distinct peak with a mass-to-charge ratio of 31 is abundant, rule out:
  - **Toluene**
- **No Distinct Peaks**: The absence of distinct peaks means that the following substance is not present:
  - **Methanol**

---

#### 3. Conductivity Test
- **0 to 10 μS/cm**: Conductivity in this range does not rule out any chemicals.
- **10 to 100 μS/cm**: If conductivity falls within this higher range, rule out:
  - **Toluene**

---

#### 4. Reaction with Silver Nitrate
- **Precipitate**: If a precipitate forms, exclude:
  - **Decane**
  - **Toluene**
- **No Precipitate**: The lack of precipitate does not exclude any substances.

---

#### 5. Boiling Point Measurement
- **0 to 50°C**: No substances are ruled out based on this boiling point range.
- **50 to 150°C**: Exclude the following if measured within this range:
  - **Acetonitrile**
  - **Toluene**
  - **Methanol**
- **150 to 300°C**: If the boiling point falls within this range, eliminate:
  - **Decane**

---

#### 6. Crystallization Test
- **Easy Crystallization**: The formation of crystals rules out:
  - **Toluene**
  - **Methanol**
- **No Crystals**: If no crystallization occurs, all substances remain as potential candidates.

In conducting these experiments, careful observation and accurate measurements are vital. This guide is designed to help eliminate possibilities, providing a systematic approach to identifying chemical substances through the exclusion of those that display specific, non-matching reactions or characteristics.

Always ensure safety and precision when handling chemicals and interpreting results within a laboratory setting.
