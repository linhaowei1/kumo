# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

Welcome to this guidebook designed to help you understand and interpret the outcomes of various chemical experiments involving different substances. Chemical analysis can be challenging, but by systematically conducting experiments and observing the results, you can narrow down the possibilities and identify substances more accurately. This guide will focus on four specific chemical substances and six experiments. Understanding how substances react under different conditions will assist you in ruling out certain possibilities when unexpected outcomes are observed.

### Chemical Substances

1. **Lactic Acid**: An organic compound commonly found in sour milk products. It has applications in food production and pharmaceuticals.

2. **Hydrochloric Acid**: A strong, corrosive acid commonly found in gastric acid. It is widely used in industry for its reactive properties.

3. **Thiourea**: An organosulfur compound used in photography and as an intermediate in the synthesis of other chemical compounds.

4. **Dichloromethane**: A volatile, colorless liquid with a sweet aroma, often used as a solvent in chemical processes.

### Experiments and Observations

**1. Reaction with Sodium Metal**

In this experiment, substances are tested for their reactivity with sodium metal. The primary observation is:

- **No Reaction**: Typically seen with Lactic Acid, this outcome **excludes Lactic Acid** as a possibility.

**2. Conductivity Test**

Conductivity tests measure how well a solution conducts electricity, indicating the presence of ions.

- **Low Conductivity (0 to 10 μS/cm)**: This range **excludes Hydrochloric Acid** since it is known for its ionization in water, resulting in high conductivity.
  
- **Moderate to High Conductivity (10 to 100 μS/cm)**: No specific substances are ruled out at this conductivity level.

**3. Reaction with Silver Nitrate**

Silver nitrate is often used to test for the presence of halides through the formation of a precipitate.

- **No Precipitate**: This outcome **excludes Dichloromethane**, as it does not react with silver nitrate.

**4. Titration with NaOH**

Used to determine the acidity or alkaline nature of a sample.

- **Requires Large Volume**: Not specific in ruling out any substance but indicates a stronger acidity.
  
- **No Significant Change**: Both Hydrochloric Acid and Lactic Acid show minimal reaction, thereby **excluding them** from significant titration change results.

**5. Odor Test**

This qualitative test identifies substances by their characteristic odors.

- **Pungent Odor**: No specific substances are excluded based on this observation.
  
- **Sweet Odor**: Observing a sweet smell **excludes Thiourea**, which is characteristic of this type of odor.
  
- **Odorless**: No compounds in this set are defined as completely odorless.

**6. Reaction with Grignard Reagent**

Grignard reagents are used to identify carbonyl groups and react with a range of compounds.

- **Vigorous Gas Evolution**: Observing this **excludes Lactic Acid**, known to produce such reactions.
  
- **Mild Reaction**: No substances are excluded by this outcome.

## Conclusion

Using the guide above, you can effectively narrow down which substances are present by observing the outcomes of the experiments provided. Remember, the goal here is to rule out substances based on the reactions or lack thereof. Carefully conduct each experiment, observe the results, and cross-reference them with this guide to make informed conclusions about the substances you're analyzing.
