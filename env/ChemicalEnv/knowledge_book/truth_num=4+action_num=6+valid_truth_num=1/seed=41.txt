# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook introduces the chemical substances: Dimethylformamide, Phenol, Styrene, and Decane. It presents experiments through which these substances can be analyzed, providing outcomes that guide us in ruling out specific substances based on observed phenomena. This approach helps in narrowing down the possibilities when identifying or analyzing chemical substances.

## Chemical Substances Overview

### Dimethylformamide (DMF)
- **Description**: A colorless, high-boiling solvent widely used in chemical reactions.
  
### Phenol
- **Description**: A colorless to pale pink crystalline solid when pure, commonly used as an antiseptic.

### Styrene
- **Description**: A colorless liquid that is an essential component in the production of polystyrene plastics and resins.
  
### Decane
- **Description**: A colorless, flammable liquid hydrocarbon part of the alkane family.

## Experiments and Outcomes

This section describes the experiments conducted to analyze the aforementioned substances and the outcomes that help in excluding certain substances.

### 1. Viscosity Measurement
- **Outcome (0, 1)**: If a viscosity level between 0 and 1 centipoises is observed, Phenol can be excluded from consideration.

### 2. Flash Point Measurement
- **Outcome (-50, 0)**: If the flash point is measured between -50°C and 0°C, Dimethylformamide can be excluded.
- **Outcome (0, 50)**: If a flash point between 0°C and 50°C is observed, Decane can be excluded.

### 3. Mass Spectrometry Peak
- **Outcome 'm_z_31_abundant'**: Observing an abundant peak at m/z 31 means Styrene can be excluded.

### 4. Color Observation
- **Outcome 'colorless'**: If the substance observed is colorless, then Phenol and Styrene can be excluded.
  
### 5. Density Measurement
- **Outcome (0.5, 0.8)**: Observing a density within the range of 0.5 to 0.8 grams/cm³ allows us to exclude Dimethylformamide and Phenol.
- **Outcome (1.0, 1.5)**: A density observation in the range of 1.0 to 1.5 grams/cm³ means Decane and Styrene can be excluded.

### 6. Melting Point Measurement
- **Outcome (0, 100)**: If the melting point is recorded within the range of 0°C to 100°C, Phenol can be excluded.

## Conclusion

This guidebook aids in systematically ruling out specific chemical substances based on observed outcomes from various experiments. By following the exclusion rules outlined here, one can effectively analyze and narrow down the identity of unknown chemical substances.
