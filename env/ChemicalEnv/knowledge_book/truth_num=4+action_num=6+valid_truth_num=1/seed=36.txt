# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook aims to introduce you to the basic chemical substances: Phenol, Methanol, Benzene, and Ethyl Acetate. It will also guide you through various experiments to identify or eliminate these substances based on specific outcomes. Understanding how each substance behaves under different conditions is crucial for effective chemical analysis.

## Chemical Substances Overview

- **Phenol**: An aromatic compound characterized by a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a benzene ring. It is slightly acidic and can react with bases.
  
- **Methanol**: The simplest alcohol with a structure of CH3OH. It's highly volatile and flammable, often used as a solvent or fuel.

- **Benzene**: An aromatic hydrocarbon with a six-carbon ring, known for its distinct odor. It’s an important precursor in the production of various chemicals.

- **Ethyl Acetate**: An ester formed from ethanol and acetic acid, with a sweet smell. It is widely used as a solvent in the pharmaceutical and food industries.

## Experiments and Interpretation

The following experiments help in distinguishing these substances by ruling out possibilities based on observed outcomes.

### 1. Boiling Point Measurement

- **Procedure**: Heat the substance gradually and note the temperature at which it transitions from liquid to gas.
  
- **Outcomes**:
  - Temperatures between 0-50°C: Rule out Phenol.
  - Temperatures between 50-150°C: Rule out Benzene and Methanol.
  - Temperatures between 150-300°C: Rule out Ethyl Acetate.

### 2. Reaction with Dilute Base

- **Procedure**: React the substance with a dilute base to observe changes.
  
- **Outcomes**:
  - If a salt forms: Rule out Benzene.
  - If no reaction is observed: Rule out Phenol.

### 3. Mass Spectrometry Peak

- **Procedure**: Analyze the substance mass spectrum and identify the most abundant peaks.
  
- **Outcomes**:
  - An abundant peak at m/z=31: Rule out Benzene.
  - No distinct peaks: Rule out Methanol.

### 4. Viscosity Measurement

- **Procedure**: Measure the flow or resistance to deformation of the liquid under various conditions.
  
- **Outcomes**:
  - Viscosity in the range of 0-1: Rule out Phenol.
  - Viscosity in the range of 1-5: Rule out Methanol.

### 5. pH Test

- **Procedure**: Measure the acidity or basicity of the substance by using pH paper or meter.
  
- **Outcomes**:
  - pH in the range of 0-3: No relevant exclusions.
  - pH in the range of 3-7: No relevant exclusions.
  - pH in the range of 7-14: Rule out Phenol.

### 6. Paper Chromatography Rf

- **Procedure**: Apply the substance to chromatography paper, develop it in a solvent, and calculate the Rf value (distance traveled by substance/ distance traveled by solvent).
  
- **Outcomes**:
  - Rf value between 0.0-0.3: Rule out Benzene.
  - Rf value between 0.3-0.7: No relevant exclusions.

## Conclusion

By systematically performing these experiments, you can effectively exclude certain substances based on the given outcomes, narrowing down the identity of the unknown substance. This process ensures accurate identification by eliminating the possibilities that do not match the observed data. Always ensure safety and accuracy while conducting chemical experiments.
