# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive introduction to the chemical substances Isopropanol, Dimethylsulfoxide, Ethanol, and Sodium Bicarbonate, and outlines specific experiments designed to help differentiate these substances. Each experiment is followed by potential outcomes which, when observed, indicate which substances can be ruled out. The goal is to aid in the identification of unknown samples using effective chemical analysis techniques.

## Chemical Substances Overview

1. **Isopropanol**: A colorless, flammable chemical compound with a strong alcohol odor. Commonly used as a solvent and in disinfectants.
   
2. **Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)**: A clear liquid known for its ability to penetrate biological membranes. It is used in various medical and industrial applications.

3. **Ethanol**: A volatile, flammable, colorless liquid often used as an antiseptic, solvent, and in alcoholic beverages.

4. **Sodium Bicarbonate**: Also known as baking soda, it is a white solid crystalline compound with a saline taste, widely used in baking and as a leavening agent.

## Experiments and Their Outcomes

### 1. Color Observation
   - **Outcome Interpretations**:
     - **Dark Brown**: Ruling out Ethanol and Isopropanol, as these are known for their clear appearance and should not exhibit a dark brown hue.

### 2. Reaction with Dilute Acid
   - **Outcome Interpretations**:
     - **No Effervescence**: Ruling out Sodium Bicarbonate, as it typically effervesces upon reacting with acids due to carbon dioxide gas release.

### 3. Refractive Index Measurement
   - **Outcome Interpretations**:
     - **Refractive Index 1.3 to 1.4**: Ruling out Dimethylsulfoxide.
     - **Refractive Index 1.4 to 1.5**: Ruling out Ethanol and Isopropanol.
     - **Refractive Index 1.5 to 1.6**: Ruling out Ethanol, Dimethylsulfoxide, and Isopropanol.

### 4. Boiling Point Measurement
   - **Outcome Interpretations**:
     - **0 to 50°C**: Ruling out Dimethylsulfoxide.
     - **50 to 150°C**: Ruling out Ethanol.
     - **150 to 300°C**: Ruling out Isopropanol.

### 5. Reaction with Sodium Metal
   - **Outcome Interpretations**:
     - **No Reaction**: Ruling out Ethanol and Isopropanol, since these substances do not react vigorously with sodium metal.

### 6. Reaction with Bromine Water
   - **Outcome Interpretations**:
     - **Decolorization**: Ruling out Ethanol and Isopropanol when decolorization occurs, indicating active chemical reactions that should not typically involve these chemicals.

## Conclusion

This guidebook instructs on differentiating Isopropanol, Dimethylsulfoxide, Ethanol, and Sodium Bicarbonate using distinct chemical experiments. Each experiment's result provides a means to rule out substances, helping identify unknown samples by exclusion. Through careful observation and analysis using this approach, the process of chemical identification can be made efficient and accurate.
