# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to introduce you to the properties and analytical tests for the following chemical substances: Isopropanol, Butadiene, Nonane, and Ethylene Glycol. Through a series of experiments, you will learn how to rule out certain substances based on observed outcomes. The experiments and corresponding observations outlined here provide a systematic approach to identifying these chemicals by exclusion.

## Chemical Substances Overview

1. **Isopropanol (C3H8O)**
   - Commonly known as rubbing alcohol
   - A clear, colorless liquid with antiseptic properties
   - Has a characteristic alcohol odor, flammable

2. **Butadiene (C4H6)**
   - A colorless gas at room temperature
   - Used in the production of synthetic rubber
   - Highly flammable, has a slightly gasoline-like smell

3. **Nonane (C9H20)**
   - A clear, colorless liquid hydrocarbon
   - Part of the alkane series, found in petroleum
   - Has a kerosene-like odor, flammable

4. **Ethylene Glycol (C2H6O2)**
   - A clear, colorless liquid used in antifreeze
   - Sweet-tasting but toxic
   - Higher viscosity compared to common liquid solvents

## Experiments and Rule-Out Outcomes

Each experiment is associated with specific outcomes that help exclude certain chemical substances from the identified possibilities.

### 1. Flash Point Measurement
- Determines the lowest temperature at which a liquid can vaporize to form an ignitable mixture in air.

  **Outcomes:**
  - (-50, 0) °C - Rule out **Ethylene Glycol**
  - (0, 50) °C - Rule out **Nonane**
  - (50, 150) °C - Rule out **Isopropanol**

### 2. Reaction with Dilute Base
- Observes the substance’s reactivity with a dilute base (e.g., NaOH).

  **Outcomes:**
  - Salt formation observed - Rule out **Nonane**
  - No reaction occurs - No substances ruled out

### 3. Paper Chromatography Rf
- Utilizes a stationary and a mobile phase to separate compounds, with Rf values indicating how far a substance travels on the paper.

  **Outcomes:**
  - Rf value (0.0, 0.3) - Rule out **Nonane**
  - Rf value (0.3, 0.7) - Rule out **Ethylene Glycol**

### 4. Reaction with Silver Nitrate
- Tests for the presence of halides through the formation of precipitates.

  **Outcomes:**
  - Precipitate forms - Rule out **Nonane**
  - No precipitate - No substances ruled out

### 5. Viscosity Measurement
- Measures resistance to flow, indicating molecular characteristics of liquids.

  **Outcomes:**
  - Viscosity range (0, 1) mPa·s - Rule out **Ethylene Glycol**
  - Viscosity range (1, 5) mPa·s - Rule out **Isopropanol**

### 6. Crystallization Test
- Evaluates the ability of a substance to form crystals upon cooling or standing.

  **Outcomes:**
  - Easy crystallization - Rule out **Isopropanol**
  - No crystals form - No substances ruled out

## Conclusion

In conducting these experiments, observing specific outcomes will allow you to systematically exclude certain chemical substances. This methodical approach aids in narrowing down possibilities based solely on exclusion, leading to accurate identification of the chemicals involved. This guidebook provides a framework for understanding the complex interrelations among various chemical properties and helps refine analytical skills in chemical analysis.
