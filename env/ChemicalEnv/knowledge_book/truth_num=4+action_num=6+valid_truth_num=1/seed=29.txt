# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to introduce you to the chemical substances Potassium Iodide, Isopropanol, Aniline, and Glucose, along with selected experiments to analyze these chemicals. The outcomes of each experiment are explained so you can effectively determine which substances can be ruled out based on observed results.

## Chemical Substances Overview

1. **Potassium Iodide (KI):**
   - A white crystalline salt commonly used in medical treatments, photography, and as a nutritional supplement.

2. **Isopropanol (C3H8O):**
   - Also known as isopropyl alcohol, it is a common solvent and cleaning agent with a characteristic alcohol-like odor.

3. **Aniline (C6H5NH2):**
   - An organic compound with a sweet odor, used in the manufacture of dyes, polymers, and rubber chemicals.

4. **Glucose (C6H12O6):**
   - A simple sugar and a fundamental energy source in biology, also utilized in food and pharmaceutical industries.

## Experiments and Their Outcomes

### 1. Viscosity Measurement

This test measures the resistance of a liquid to flow. Outcomes indicate viscosity ranges:

- **Range (0, 1):** No substances are ruled out.
- **Range (1, 5):** If observed, Isopropanol can be ruled out.

### 2. Crystallization Test

This experiment observes the ease with which a substance forms crystals:

- **Easy Crystallization:** If observed, Isopropanol can be ruled out.
- **No Crystals:** If no crystallization occurs, Glucose can be ruled out.

### 3. Reaction with Silver Nitrate

This chemical reaction tests for the formation of a precipitate:

- **Precipitate:** No substances are specifically ruled out.
- **No Precipitate:** If no precipitate forms, Potassium Iodide can be ruled out.

### 4. Polarimetry

Polarimetry measures the rotation of polarized light caused by optically active substances:

- **Range (-10, 0):** No substances are specifically ruled out.
- **Range (0, 10):** If observed, Potassium Iodide can be ruled out.

### 5. Odor Test

This simple test involves the identification of an odor emitted by a chemical substance:

- **Pungent Odor:** If detected, both Potassium Iodide and Glucose can be ruled out.
- **Sweet Odor:** If present, Aniline can be ruled out.
- **Odorless:** No substances are specifically ruled out.

### 6. Reaction with Bromine Water

This reaction checks whether a substance can decolorize bromine water:

- **Decolorization:** If the bromine water is decolorized, Isopropanol can be ruled out.
- **No Change:** No substances are specifically ruled out.

## Using the Guidebook

As you conduct each experiment, carefully observe the outcome. Use the information provided to rule out the applicable substances. This method aids in narrowing down the possibilities and identifying the correct chemical substance from the initial list based on the observed results.

By following this structured approach, youâ€™ll gain a clearer understanding of the substances' properties and interactions, fostering better decision-making in chemical analysis.
