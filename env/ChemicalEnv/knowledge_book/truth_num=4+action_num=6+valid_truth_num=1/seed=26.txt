# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is intended to provide clarity and instructions on how to conduct specific experiments using various chemical substances and interpret the outcomes effectively. The substances covered include Acetic Anhydride, Propylene, Citric Acid, and Butadiene. Through this methodical approach, we aim to determine which chemicals are not present based on specific test outcomes.

## Chemical Substances

1. **Acetic Anhydride**
   - A reactive compound primarily used in chemical synthesis. It has a moderate density.

2. **Propylene**
   - Also known as propene, it is a colorless gas often used in the production of polypropylene plastics and other chemical applications.

3. **Citric Acid**
   - A weak organic acid found naturally in citrus fruits. It is often used in food, cleaning, and as an acidulant.

4. **Butadiene**
   - A colorless gas that is commonly used in the production of synthetic rubber and other polymers.

## Experiments and Their Interpretations

The following experiments are used to analyze chemical substances by ruling out possibilities based on observed outcomes:

### 1. Melting Point Measurement
- **Objective**: To determine the temperature at which a substance transitions from solid to liquid.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **(-100, 0)°C**: No specific substances eliminated.
  - **(0, 100)°C**: Citric Acid is ruled out if the substance remains solid in this range.

### 2. Density Measurement
- **Objective**: To determine the mass per unit volume of a substance.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **(0.5, 0.8) g/cm³**: Acetic Anhydride is ruled out if the density falls within this range.
  - **(0.8, 1.0) g/cm³** and **(1.0, 1.5) g/cm³**: No substances are eliminated within these ranges.

### 3. IR Absorption Band
- **Objective**: To identify functional groups in a substance through infrared spectroscopy.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **broad OH band**: No substances are excluded by this observation.
  - **C=O stretch**: Propylene is ruled out if this band is observed.
  - **No specific bands**: No substances are eliminated.

### 4. Reaction with Grignard Reagent
- **Objective**: To observe the reactivity of a substance with a Grignard reagent, indicating certain functional groups.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Vigorous gas evolution**: Citric Acid is eliminated if this reaction occurs.
  - **Mild reaction**: No substances are ruled out.

### 5. pH Test
- **Objective**: To measure the acidity or basicity of a substance.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **(0, 3)**: No substances are eliminated within this pH range.
  - **(3, 7)**: No substances are eliminated in this pH range.
  - **(7, 14)**: Citric Acid is ruled out if the substance is basic in this range.

### 6. Reaction with Dilute Base
- **Objective**: To observe changes indicating neutralization or other reactions with a base.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Salt formation**: No substances are eliminated if salt formation is observed.
  - **No reaction**: Citric Acid is ruled out if no reaction occurs.

By following these guidelines, chemists can systematically eliminate chemical possibilities and narrow down to the probable substances present through careful analysis and interpretation of experimental outcomes. This rule-out approach is crucial in identifying the correct chemical by comparing the results of various tests.
