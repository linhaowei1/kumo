# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction to Chemical Substances

In this guidebook, we will explore four chemical substances that are frequently encountered in laboratory settings. These are Dichloromethane, Formaldehyde, Sulfuric Acid, and Carbon Tetrachloride. Understanding their properties and reactions is vital for conducting proper chemical analysis and identifying unknown substances. Below is a brief introduction to each chemical:

1. **Dichloromethane**: A volatile, colorless liquid commonly used as a solvent in various chemical processes. It has non-polar characteristics and is immiscible with water.

2. **Formaldehyde**: A colorless, pungent-smelling gas used in the production of industrial resins and as a preservative. It has significant health risks due to its carcinogenic properties.

3. **Sulfuric Acid**: A strong mineral acid with a wide range of applications in industry, particularly in the production of fertilizers. It is highly corrosive and can be a dangerous substance to handle.

4. **Carbon Tetrachloride**: A colorless liquid with a sweet smell, once commonly used as a cleaning agent. It has been largely phased out due to its environmental and health hazards.

## Chemical Experiments and Rule-Out Outcomes

Various chemical experiments can be conducted to identify these chemicals or rule out possibilities when analyzing an unknown sample. Here is a detailed guide to the experiments and their rule-out outcomes.

### 1. Refractive Index Measurement

By measuring the refractive index of a sample, we can determine the speed of light passing through it, which can help rule out certain substances:

- **Refractive Index Range (1.3–1.4)**: No substances can be ruled out with this measurement outcome.
- **Refractive Index Range (1.4–1.5) or (1.5–1.6)**: Formaldehyde can be ruled out.

### 2. Conductivity Test

Conductivity tests measure a liquid’s ability to conduct electricity, primarily indicating the presence of ions:

- **Conductivity Range (0–10 µS/cm)**: Sulfuric Acid can be ruled out due to its high ionic content.
- **Conductivity Range (10–100 µS/cm)**: No substances can be automatically ruled out.

### 3. Color Observation

Observing the coloration of a chemical can be enlightening:

- **Colorless**: No substances can be specifically ruled out, as all on this list could present as colorless under certain conditions.
- **Pale Yellow**: Carbon Tetrachloride can be ruled out.
- **Dark Brown**: Similar to colorless, this outcome doesn't exclude any substances among our list.

### 4. Titration with NaOH

Titration with sodium hydroxide helps determine an acid's or base's presence and strength:

- **Requires Large Volume to Reach End Point**: Carbon Tetrachloride can be ruled out, as it is not reactive with NaOH.
- **No Significant Change**: No substances can be ruled out by this outcome.

### 5. Boiling Point Measurement

Determining boiling points is a fundamental method to identify or exclude possibilities in a sample:

- **Boiling Point Range (0–50°C)**: No substances are ruled out.
- **Boiling Point Range (50–150°C)**: Formaldehyde can be ruled out.
- **Boiling Point Range (150–300°C)**: Dichloromethane and Carbon Tetrachloride can be ruled out, given they both fall within this range.

### 6. Reaction with Sodium Metal

This experiment tests a substance's reaction with a reactive metal, indicating the presence of certain functional groups:

- **Vigorous Reaction**: Carbon Tetrachloride can be ruled out as it would not elicit such a response.
- **No Reaction**: No substances are ruled out based on this outcome.

## Conclusion

By carefully conducting these chemical experiments and observing the given outcomes, one can effectively rule out possibilities and work toward identifying or understanding the chemical substances in question. The key is to utilize each experiment to gather as much exclusionary evidence as possible, thereby narrowing down the potential substances to their most likely candidates. Always ensure safety protocols are followed when handling these chemicals and conducting experiments.
