3. **Sulfuric Acid**: A strong acid used in various chemical processes.
4. **Carbon Tetrachloride**: An organic compound used as a solvent or cleaning agent.
5. **Toluene**: A solvent commonly associated with paints, coatings, and adhesives.
6. **Ethylene Glycol**: A compound used primarily as an antifreeze and in coolants.
7. **Phenol**: A compound with antiseptic properties, used in resins and plastics.
8. **Benzene**: An essential industrial solvent and precursor to many chemicals.
9. **Isopropanol**: Also known as isopropyl alcohol, used as a disinfectant and solvent.
10. **Hydrochloric Acid**: A strong acid used in industry and laboratory applications.
11. **Acetone**: A solvent known for its use in nail polish remover and lab settings.
12. **Heptane**: Often used as a non-polar solvent in chemical analyses.
