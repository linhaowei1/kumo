# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides insights into analyzing various chemical substances using a set of predefined experiments. The primary goal is to use these experiments to exclude certain substances based on observed outcomes, thereby narrowing down the possibilities and aiding in substance identification.

## Chemical Substances Introduction

### 1. Chloroform
Chloroform is a colorless, sweet-smelling organic compound. It is commonly used as a solvent and has applications in industrial processes.

### 2. Ethylene Glycol
Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless liquid with a sweet taste. It is used as an antifreeze and in the production of polyesters.

### 3. Hexane
Hexane is a volatile, colorless liquid with a faint odor. It is often used as a solvent in the extraction of edible oils.

### 4. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO)
DMSO is a solvent with both polar and organic properties. It is used in pharmaceuticals and as a carrier for other drugs.

### 5. Hydrochloric Acid
Hydrochloric acid is a strong, corrosive acid that is commonly used in chemical research and industrial applications.

### 6. Nonane
Nonane is a hydrocarbon with low polarity, used mainly in research and industry as a solvent.

### 7. Toluene
Toluene is a clear, water-insoluble liquid with a distinct smell, widely used as an industrial solvent and in the production of chemicals.

### 8. Isopropanol
Isopropanol, or isopropyl alcohol, is a colorless, flammable liquid used as a solvent and cleaning fluid.

### 9. Benzene
Benzene is a highly flammable, colorless liquid known for its sweet smell. It is a significant industrial chemical and a known carcinogen.

### 10. Boric Acid
Boric acid is a weak, monobasic acid often used as an antiseptic. It has low toxicity and presents in white crystalline form.

### 11. Potassium Iodide
Potassium iodide is a chemical compound that appears as a white crystalline salt, used mainly in medicine and photography.

### 12. Ethyl Acetate
Ethyl acetate is a colorless liquid used in paints as a solvent due to its quick evaporation rate and ability to dissolve other chemicals.
