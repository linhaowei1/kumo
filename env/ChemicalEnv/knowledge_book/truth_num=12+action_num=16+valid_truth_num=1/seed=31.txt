## Chemical Substances Overview

In this guide, we focus on the following chemical substances: 

1. **Acetic Anhydride**
2. **Ethanol**
3. **Citric Acid**
4. **Methanol**
5. **Octane**
6. **Styrene**
7. **Sodium Chloride**
8. **Acetic Acid**
9. **Ammonia**
10. **Formaldehyde**
11. **Butadiene**
12. **Sodium Bicarbonate**

Each substance has distinct properties that can be explored through various experiments to aid in their identification.

## Experiments and Outcomes

### 1. Density Measurement
Density helps differentiate substances based on mass per unit volume. When performing density measurement:
- **0.5 - 0.8 g/cm³** eliminates Acetic Anhydride and Acetic Acid.
- **0.8 - 1.0 g/cm³** rules out Sodium Chloride.
- **1.0 - 1.5 g/cm³** eliminates Styrene and Octane.

### 2. Reaction with Fehling's Solution
This test identifies reducing sugars and aldehydes:
- **Red precipitate** rules out Octane.
- **No change** eliminates Formaldehyde.

### 3. Reaction with Bromine Water
Used to identify unsaturated compounds:
- **Decolorization** rules out Ethanol and Methanol.
- **No change** eliminates Styrene and Butadiene.

### 4. Titration with HCl
Helps determine acid-base behavior:
- **Significant neutralization** eliminates Octane.
- **No reaction** rules out Ammonia and Sodium Bicarbonate.

### 5. Color Observation
Color can provide immediate clues about a substance:
- **Colorless** eliminates Styrene.
- **Pale yellow** rules out Methanol.
- **Dark brown** eliminates Ethanol and Octane.

### 6. Flash Point Measurement
This determines flammability at different temperatures:
- **0 - 50°C** rules out Octane.
- **50 - 150°C** eliminates Ethanol and Methanol.

### 7. Reaction with Dilute Base
Determines reactivity with a base:
- **Salt formation** rules out Octane.
- **No reaction** eliminates Citric Acid and Acetic Acid.

### 8. Polarimetry
Measures the optical rotation of substances:
- **-10 to 0°** rules out Octane.
- **0 to 10°** eliminates Sodium Chloride.

### 9. Melting Point Measurement
Identifies substances based on solid phase transition:
- **-100 to 0°C** rules out Sodium Bicarbonate.
- **0 to 100°C** eliminates Citric Acid and Acetic Acid.

### 10. TLC Rf Comparison
Thin Layer Chromatography helps in identifying compound mobility:
- **Rf 0.0 to 0.4** eliminates Octane.
- **Rf 0.4 to 0.8** rules out Acetic Acid.

### 11. Conductivity Test
Assesses ion presence in a solution:
- **0 to 10 μS/cm** rules out Sodium Chloride.
- **10 to 100 μS/cm** eliminates Octane.

### 12. Reaction with Iodine Solution
Used to check for certain carbonyl compounds:
- **Iodoform test positive** rules out Octane.
- **No reaction** eliminates Ethanol.

### 13. Titration with NaOH
Helps in determining basicity:
- **Requires large volume** rules out Octane.
- **No significant change** eliminates Citric Acid and Acetic Acid.

### 14. Reaction with Dilute Acid
Checks reactivity with acid:
- **Effervescence** rules out Octane.
- **No effervescence** eliminates Sodium Bicarbonate.

### 15. UV-Vis Absorption
Analyzes light absorption characteristics:
- **200 to 250 nm** rules out Styrene.
- **250 to 300 nm** eliminates Sodium Chloride.

### 16. Crystallization Test
Tests for a substance's crystallization capacity:
- **Easy crystallization** rules out Ethanol and Methanol.
- **No crystals** (This outcome does not rule out any specified substances.)

## Conclusion

By systematically applying these experiments and interpreting their outcomes, you can efficiently rule out certain chemical substances and focus on those that remain as potential candidates. Understanding these principles is key to mastering chemical analysis and making precise identifications within laboratory settings. Use this guide to explore and discover the vast world of chemistry!
