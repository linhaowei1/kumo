# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the guidebook on chemical analysis. This guide aims to help you understand various chemical substances and the experiments you can conduct to study their properties. The focus here is on 12 specific chemical substances and a series of experiments that can help distinguish one from another. By applying these experiments, you can systematically exclude certain substances until you identify the unknown substance. Below, you'll find a detailed explanation of each chemical substance and the corresponding experimental outcomes that will rule them out as possibilities.

## Chemical Substances

1. **Ammonia (NH₃)**
   - A colorless gas with a pungent odor, it is commonly used as a fertilizer and in cleaning products.

2. **Formaldehyde (CH₂O)**
   - A colorless gas with a distinct smell, used in making building materials and household products.

3. **Ethylene Glycol (C₂H₆O₂)**
   - A sweet-tasting, colorless liquid, primarily used as an antifreeze in cooling and heating systems.

4. **Acetonitrile (CH₃CN)**
   - A colorless liquid with a slight odor, used as a solvent in the purification of butadiene.

5. **Ethyl Acetate (C₄H₈O₂)**
   - A colorless liquid with a characteristic sweet smell, commonly used as a solvent in inks and paints.

6. **Ethylene (C₂H₄)**
   - A colorless flammable gas with a sweet odor, used in the chemical industry and as a plant hormone.

7. **Sodium Chloride (NaCl)**
   - A white crystalline solid commonly known as salt, used in food and various industrial processes.

8. **Dichloromethane (CH₂Cl₂)**
   - A volatile liquid with a sweet and pleasant odor, used as a solvent.

9. **Heptane (C₇H₁₆)**
   - A colorless liquid with a mild gasoline-like odor, used in laboratories as a non-polar solvent.

10. **Benzene (C₆H₆)**
   - A colorless liquid with a sweet odor, used as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals.

11. **Chloroform (CHCl₃)**
   - A colorless, sweet-smelling liquid once used as an anesthetic.

12. **Dimethylformamide (C₃H₇NO)**
   - A colorless liquid with a faint fishy odor, used widely as a solvent.
