# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a foundational understanding of several chemical substances and outlines a series of experiments designed to differentiate and identify these substances based on their reactions and properties. By conducting a series of tests, we can systematically exclude substances that produce certain observable outcomes. Below, we introduce the chemical substances, the experiments, and the specific outcomes that can help rule out certain substances from consideration.

## Chemical Substances Overview

   - Commonly used as an antiseptic or insecticide; possesses weak acidic properties.
   
2. **Dimethylformamide (DMF)**
   - An organic solvent notable for its high boiling point and ability to mix with water.

3. **Sodium Bicarbonate**
   - Known as baking soda, it acts as a mild base used in cooking and cleaning.
   
4. **Ethylene**
   - A gaseous hydrocarbon used for ripening fruits and as a precursor to various plastics.

5. **Butadiene**
   - A gas used in the production of synthetic rubber.

6. **Decane**
   - A liquid hydrocarbon part of gasoline; used as a solvent and in fuel.

7. **Propylene**
   - A colorless gas used in the production of polypropylene plastic.

8. **Urea**
   - A nitrogen-containing substance used in fertilizers and pharmaceuticals.

9. **Toluene**
   - A clear, insoluble liquid often used as an industrial solvent.

10. **Nonane**
    - A liquid hydrocarbon used as a solvent and reference fuel.

11. **Ethyl Acetate**
    - A colorless liquid used as a solvent in paints and coatings.

12. **Acetone**
    - A solvent widely used in nail polish remover and cleaning agents.
