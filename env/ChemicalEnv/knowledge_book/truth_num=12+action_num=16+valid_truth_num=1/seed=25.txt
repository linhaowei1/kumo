# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
Welcome to the Chemical Analysis Guidebook, a comprehensive resource designed to guide you through the identification and analysis of various chemical substances using standard laboratory experiments. This guide focuses on twelve distinct chemical substances and sixteen common experimental tests. Follow this guide to understand how each test can help you systematically rule out substances based on observed outcomes.

### Chemical Substances
1. **Dimethylformamide (DMF)**: An organic solvent known for its high boiling point and miscibility with water and most organic liquids.
2. **Acetone**: A colorless, volatile, and flammable liquid widely used as a solvent.
3. **Butadiene**: A colorless gas that’s used primarily in the production of synthetic rubber.
4. **Ethylene Glycol**: A colorless, sweet-tasting liquid commonly used as antifreeze.
5. **Sucrose**: A common sugar found in many plants.
6. **Hydrochloric Acid**: A strong, corrosive acid commonly used in industrial and laboratory processes.
7. **Ethanol**: A colorless volatile liquid, commonly used as a solvent and in alcoholic beverages.
8. **Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4)**: A colorless liquid with a sweet smell that can be used as a solvent or cleaning agent.
9. **Citric Acid**: A weak organic acid occurring naturally in citrus fruits.
10. **Boric Acid**: A weak acid often used as an antiseptic or insecticide.
11. **Calcium Carbonate**: A white solid found in rocks and the shells of marine organisms.
12. **Acetaldehyde**: A volatile, flammable liquid with a pungent odor, used as an intermediate in chemical synthesis.
