- **Dimethylformamide (DMF)**: An organic compound often used as a solvent.
- **Octane**: A hydrocarbon found in gasoline, known for its role in determining fuel ratings.
- **Propylene**: A hydrocarbon gas that is a significant raw material in the petrochemical industry.
- **Ethanol**: A widely used alcohol, often present in alcoholic beverages and as a solvent.
- **Toluene**: A clear, water-insoluble solvent, often used in the production of paints and coatings.
- **Boric Acid**: A weak acid used in antiseptics and insecticides.
- **Chloroform**: A volatile organic compound formerly used as an anesthetic.
- **Nitric Acid**: A strong acid known for its application in fertilizers.
- **Butadiene**: A gas used in the production of synthetic rubber.
- **Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)**: An organosulfur compound used as a polar aprotic solvent.

## Experiments and Outcomes

Let's delve into the specific experiments and interpret the outcomes accordingly:

### 1. Boiling Point Measurement

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - If you observe boiling within the range of **0-50°C**, you can rule out Dimethylformamide and Dimethylsulfoxide.
  - For temperatures **50-150°C**, exclude Ethanol, Chloroform, Toluene, and Acetonitrile.
  - A range of **150-300°C** indicates exclusion of Styrene and Propylene.

### 2. Melting Point Measurement

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - A melting point from **-100 to 0°C** does not exclude any substances.
  - At temperatures **0-100°C**, you should eliminate Boric Acid.

### 3. IR Absorption Band

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - Presence of a **broad OH band** rules out Chloroform, Toluene, and Octane.
  - Observing a **C=O stretch** excludes Toluene and Propylene.
  - **No specific bands** point to ruling out Ethanol.

### 4. Conductivity Test

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - Conductivity between **0 and 10** rules out Nitric Acid.
  - Values from **10 to 100** indicate exclusion of Toluene and Octane.

### 5. Flash Point Measurement

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - A flash point within **-50 to 0°C** rules out Dimethylformamide and Dimethylsulfoxide.
  - For **0-50°C**, exclude Octane.
  - **50-150°C** suggests excluding Ethanol and Chloroform.

### 6. Reaction with Dilute Acid

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - **Effervescence** observed rules out Toluene and Octane.
  - **No effervescence** does not exclude any additional substances.

### 7. Mass Spectrometry Peak

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - An **m/z 31 abundant peak** rules out Styrene, Chloroform, and Toluene.
  - **No distinct peaks** indicate exclusion of Ethanol.

### 8. Reaction with Bromine Water

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - **Decolorization** rules out Ethanol and Chloroform.
  - **No change** means you should exclude Styrene, Butadiene, and Propylene.

### 9. Reaction with Silver Nitrate

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - Formation of a **precipitate** rules out Toluene and Octane.
  - **No precipitate** means excluding Chloroform.

### 10. Viscosity Measurement

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - Viscosity between **0 and 1** suggests ruling out Dimethylsulfoxide.
  - Observing **1-5** indicates elimination of Ethanol and Chloroform.

### 11. Solubility in Water

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - **Soluble** substances are Styrene, Toluene, and Octane; exclude them if solubility is observed.
  - **Partially soluble** rules out Nitric Acid.
  - **Insoluble** indicates exclusion of Ethanol, Dimethylformamide, and Dimethylsulfoxide.

### 12. Color Observation

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - **Colorless** appearance excludes Styrene.
  - **Pale yellow** indicates ruling out Chloroform and Toluene.
  - A **dark brown** color suggests elimination of Ethanol and Octane.

### 13. Refractive Index Measurement

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - A refractive index of **1.3-1.4** excludes Styrene, Dimethylformamide, Toluene, and Dimethylsulfoxide.
  - **1.4-1.5** suggests excluding Styrene and Ethanol.
  - In the range of **1.5-1.6**, rule out Ethanol, Dimethylformamide, Toluene, and Dimethylsulfoxide.

### 14. Reaction with Dilute Base

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - **Salt formation** indicates ruling out Chloroform, Toluene, and Octane.
  - **No reaction** does not exclude any additional substances.

### 15. UV-Vis Absorption

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - Absorbance within **200-250 nm** suggests excluding Styrene.
  - Between **250-300 nm**, no substances are excluded based on this outcome.

### 16. Titration with HCl

- **Outcome Interpretation**:
  - **Significant neutralization** rules out Chloroform, Toluene, and Octane.
  - **No reaction** does not exclude any additional substances.

This guide provides a structured way to analyze and identify possible chemical substances based on experimental observations. Utilize this information to rule out substances and refine your analysis with confidence.
