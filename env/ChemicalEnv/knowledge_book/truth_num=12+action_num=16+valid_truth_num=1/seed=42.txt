# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Chemical Analysis Guidebook, where we aim to provide comprehensive guidance on analyzing several chemical substances using a variety of experiments. This guide is intended to be a useful resource for determining the identity of various chemicals based on the exclusion of possibilities through experimental observations. Below, you will find detailed descriptions of each chemical substance and experiment, followed by specific outcomes that would rule out certain substances. This method allows for a systematic approach to narrowing down the potential identity of an unknown substance.

## Chemical Substances Overview

3. **Benzene**: A colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell, extensively used as an industrial solvent.
4. **Dichloromethane**: A volatile, non-flammable organic compound used as a solvent.
5. **Chloroform**: A chlorinated solvent often used as an anesthetic in the past.
6. **Styrene**: An organic compound used in the production of polystyrene plastics and resins.
7. **Octane**: An alkane with the formula C8H18, a key component in gasoline.
8. **Hexane**: An alkane frequently used in the extraction of vegetable oils.
9. **Sodium Chloride**: Common table salt, widely used in food seasoning and preservation.
10. **Toluene**: A clear, water-insoluble solvent with a distinctive smell associated with paint thinners.
11. **Sodium Bicarbonate**: Also known as baking soda, widely used in cooking and as a leavening agent.
12. **Acetaldehyde**: A volatile compound used as an intermediate in the synthesis of other chemicals.
