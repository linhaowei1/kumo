# Chemical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to help you perform a series of experiments to analyze and understand the properties of various chemical substances. The substances in focus are: Methanol, Toluene, Acetic Anhydride, Acetonitrile, Decane, Citric Acid, Ethylene Glycol, Carbon Tetrachloride, Glucose, Butadiene, Sucrose, and Ethanol. Through these experiments, we aim to deduce the various attributes of these substances by ruling out certain possibilities as each result is observed.
