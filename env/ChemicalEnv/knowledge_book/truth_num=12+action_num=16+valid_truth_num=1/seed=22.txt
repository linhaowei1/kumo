## Introduction to Chemical Substances

In this guidebook, we focus on a variety of chemical substances, each with unique properties and behaviors. The chemical substances covered in this guide include:

- **Octane**: A colorless flammable liquid, typically used in fuels such as gasoline.
- **Chloroform**: A dense liquid commonly used as a solvent or in the production of refrigerants.
- **Benzene**: A highly flammable colorless liquid with important industrial applications.
- **Fructose**: A simple sugar found in many plants, often used as a sweetener.
- **Acetic Acid**: A colorless liquid organic compound with a pungent smell, used in vinegar.
- **Ethylene**: A colorless flammable gas with a sweet odor, used in the production of polyethylene.
- **Heptane**: A colorless liquid hydrocarbon that is a constituent of petrol.
- **Lactic Acid**: An organic acid found in sour milk products, used in food and pharmaceuticals.
- **Aniline**: An organic compound used in the manufacture of dyes and polyurethanes.
- **Toluene**: A clear, water-insoluble liquid used as an industrial solvent.
- **Styrene**: A liquid hydrocarbon used in the production of polystyrene plastics.
- **Dichloromethane**: A volatile liquid with applications as a solvent in chemical reactions.

## Experiments and Their Outcomes

### 1. UV-Vis Absorption

The UV-Vis absorption experiment helps identify substances based on their ability to absorb ultraviolet and visible light.

- **Observing absorption between 200-250 nm** rules out **Styrene, Benzene, and Aniline** as they all absorb within this range.

### 2. IR Absorption Band

Infrared absorption reveals characteristic features of substances based on their molecular vibrations.

- **Detection of a broad OH band** rules out **Chloroform, Toluene, Benzene, Heptane, or Octane**.
- **C=O stretch presence** excludes **Heptane, Ethylene, Toluene, Benzene**.
- **Absence of specific bands** eliminates **Acetic Acid**.

### 3. Titration with NaOH

This titration measures a substance’s acidity or basicity through a reaction with sodium hydroxide.

- **Large volume requirement** excludes **Chloroform, Toluene, Benzene, Heptane, Octane**.
- **Lack of significant change** eliminates **Lactic Acid and Acetic Acid**.

### 4. Crystallization Test

This test assesses the ease with which a substance forms crystals.

- **Easy crystallization** rules out **Toluene and Benzene**.
- **Presence of no crystals** rules out **Fructose**.

### 5. Reaction with Silver Nitrate

This reaction can produce a precipitate, hinting at the presence of certain elements.

- **Precipitate formation** rules out **Heptane, Octane, Toluene, Benzene**.
- **No precipitate observed** eliminates **Dichloromethane, Chloroform**.

### 6. Paper Chromatography Rf

Paper chromatography separates components based on their movement on paper.

- **Rf values between 0.0 and 0.3** rule out **Heptane, Benzene, Toluene, Octane**.

### 7. Reaction with Grignard Reagent

Grignard reagents are used to determine the presence of active hydrogens.

- **Vigorous gas evolution** rules out **Lactic Acid, Acetic Acid, Aniline**.
- **Mild reaction** eliminates **Heptane, Benzene, Toluene, Octane**.

### 8. Solubility in Ethanol

Solubility tests assess how well substances dissolve in a given solvent.

- **Insolubility in ethanol** excludes **Heptane, Octane, Toluene, Benzene**.

### 9. Titration with HCl

Similar to NaOH titration, this focuses on reaction with hydrochloric acid.

- **Significant neutralization** rules out **Chloroform, Toluene, Benzene, Heptane, Octane**.

### 10. Reaction with Iodine Solution

This traces reactivity with iodine, often yielding a noticeable reaction.

- **Positive iodoform test** excludes **Heptane, Benzene, Toluene, Octane**.

### 11. TLC Rf Comparison

Thin-layer chromatography helps identify substances based on retention factor.

- **Rf values of 0.0 to 0.4** rule out **Heptane, Octane**.

### 12. Viscosity Measurement

The viscosity measurement evaluates a liquid’s resistance to flow.

- **Viscosity range of 1 to 5** rules out **Chloroform**.

### 13. Reaction with Bromine Water

This test identifies substances that undergo halogenation.

- **Decolorization indicates** **Chloroform** should be ruled out.
- **No change** eliminates **Styrene, Ethylene**.

### 14. Reaction with Dilute Base

This identifies reactive acidic functional groups with bases.

- **Salt formation** eliminates **Chloroform, Toluene, Benzene, Heptane, Octane**.
- **No reaction** rules out **Lactic Acid and Acetic Acid**.

### 15. Flame Color Test

Different substances impart distinctive colors to a flame when burned.

- **Green flame** rules out **Heptane, Benzene, Toluene, Octane**.
- **Yellow flame** rules out **Dichloromethane and Chloroform**.

### 16. Polarimetry

Polarimetry measures the rotation of plane-polarized light caused by optically active substances.

- **Optical rotation between -10 and 0 degrees** eliminates **Chloroform, Toluene, Benzene, Heptane, Octane**.

## Conclusion

Understanding the outcomes of chemical experiments allows for the exclusion of certain substances based on observed reactions. By systematically applying these tests, we can efficiently narrow down potential chemical identities. The results, as mentioned above, help guide the conclusions drawn during a chemical analysis, effectively ruling out specific substances based on the experimental evidence obtained.
