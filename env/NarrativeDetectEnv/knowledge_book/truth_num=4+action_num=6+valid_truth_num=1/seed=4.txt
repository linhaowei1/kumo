# Narrative Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook is designed to help you navigate the complexities of narrative analysis with a focus on understanding narrative arcs and employing various analysis techniques. We will explore four specific narrative arcs: "Sacrificial Hero," "Fable," "Tragedy," and "Allegory." Alongside these arcs, we'll introduce and explain key plot structure analysis techniques, helping you to identify and understand the intricate patterns and structures within storytelling.

## Narrative Arcs

### 1. Sacrificial Hero
The "Sacrificial Hero" narrative arc centers around a protagonist who willingly sacrifices themselves for a greater good, often embodying virtues like bravery, selflessness, and honor. This arc highlights themes of personal sacrifice and societal or collective benefit.

### 2. Fable
A "Fable" is a short story that typically features animals as characters and conveys a moral lesson. The narrative is straightforward, with clear moral implications designed to teach or highlight ethical behaviors and values.

### 3. Tragedy
The "Tragedy" narrative arc involves a protagonist who faces downfall due to a combination of personal flaws and certain external circumstances. These stories often explore themes of fate, loss, and the inevitability of suffering.

### 4. Allegory
An "Allegory" features a narrative that serves as an extended metaphor, where characters and events represent deeper meanings or abstract concepts. This arc often explores philosophical, moral, or political themes.

## Plot Structure Analysis Techniques

### 1. Archetype Identification
This technique involves identifying common character types within a story, such as the hero, villain, or trickster. Understanding these archetypes can provide insights into the roles and motivations of characters within the narrative.

- **Exclusions**:
  - If a story identifies a "Hero" archetype, it cannot be a "Tragedy."
  - If a narrative has a "Villain" archetype, it excludes the possibility of being a "Sacrificial Hero."
  - "Heroâ€™s Journey Archetype" excludes "Tragedy."
  - "Trickster" and "No Clear Archetype" have no exclusions.

### 2. Protagonist Examination
Examining the protagonist involves understanding their development throughout the story. Are they dynamic, changing through the narrative, or static, remaining the same?

- **Exclusions**:
  - If a protagonist is identified as "Dynamic," it excludes "Fable."
  - "Static Protagonist" has no exclusions.

### 3. Falling Action Analysis
This technique analyzes the part of a narrative following the climax, where the conflicts begin to resolve, and the story moves towards a conclusion.

- **Exclusions**:
  - Falling action analysis where (0, 25)% of resolution falls within the narrative excludes "Tragedy."
  - No other exclusions exist for different ranges of falling action.

### 4. Motif Recognition
Motifs are recurring elements or themes throughout a story. Recognizing these can bring deeper understanding of the story's underlying messages.

- **Exclusions**:
  - "No Recurring Motifs" excludes "Allegory."
  - Motifs like "Journey," "Transformation," "Redemption," and "Recurring Motifs Present" have no exclusions.

### 5. Circular Narrative Study
Circular narrative structures involve stories that return to the original starting point, reflecting themes of eternal return or cyclical nature.

- **Exclusions**:
  - Identification of a "Linear Structure" excludes "Tragedy."
  - "Circular Structure" and "Episodic Structure" have no exclusions.

### 6. Narrative Perspective Study
This technique focuses on identifying the point of view from which a story is told, such as first person, third person, etc.

- **Exclusions**:
  - An "Omniscient" perspective excludes "Tragedy."
  - "Second Person" perspective excludes "Fable."
  - "Multiple POV" excludes both "Allegory" and "Fable."
  - "First Person" and "Third Person" have no exclusions.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides a foundation for understanding and analyzing narrative structures. By using the outlined techniques and understanding the associated exclusions, you can discern which narrative arcs are less likely, enhancing your ability to analyze and interpret complex stories. Remember, narrative analysis is both an art and a science, and ongoing practice will improve your analytical skills.
