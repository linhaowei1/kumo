# Narrative Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook aims to introduce and elucidate key narrative arcs and analysis techniques to aid in the comprehensive examination of narratives. By understanding how different elements of a story come together, we can better analyze and appreciate the complexity and depth of narratives. This guidebook covers four primary narrative arcs: **'Forbidden Knowledge'**, **'Epic'**, **'Fable'**, and **'Man vs. Self'**. It also delves into various plot structure analysis techniques, including **Conflict Identification, Archetype Identification, Protagonist Examination, Allegory Interpretation, Narrative Voice Analysis**, and **Plot Structure Analysis**. Each analysis technique is paired with exclusion rules to clarify which narrative arcs are eliminated based on specific outcomes of the analysis.

## Narrative Arcs

1. **Forbidden Knowledge**: This arc explores themes of curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge that is deemed off-limits or dangerous. It often highlights the consequences of such pursuits, offering a cautionary tale about the limits of human understanding and the repercussions of overreaching.

2. **Epic**: Epics are grand tales often featuring heroic deeds, legendary characters, and events of great significance. They typically span vast settings and timeframes and explore themes like heroism, fate, and the struggle against monumental challenges.

3. **Fable**: Fables are short stories that convey a moral lesson. They often use animals or inanimate objects as characters to illustrate human virtues and vices, providing clear insights into ethical behavior.

4. **Man vs. Self**: This arc centers around internal conflict within the protagonist, focusing on personal struggles, moral dilemmas, and psychological growth. It typically explores themes of identity, self-discovery, and the complexities of human nature.

## Plot Structure Analysis Techniques

### 1. Conflict Identification
In narrative analysis, identifying the central conflict is crucial. Conflicts can be categorized into several types:

- **Internal Conflict**: Struggles occurring within a character's mind.
- **External Conflict**: Challenges that characters face from outside forces, such as nature, society, or other characters.

**Exclusion Rules**:
- **Man vs. Man** and **Man vs. Society**: When identifying conflict as either "Man vs. Man" or "Man vs. Society," rule out the "Man vs. Self" narrative arc.
- **Man vs. Technology**: This conflict excludes the "Fable" narrative arc.

### 2. Archetype Identification
Analyzing archetypes involves recognizing recurring character types that resonate across different stories:

- **Hero**: A courageous figure who often embodies noble qualities.
- **Villain**: The antagonist who typically opposes the hero's goals.
- **Trickster**: A character who uses wit and cunning to outsmart others.
- **Hero's Journey Archetype**: A narrative structure involving stages of departure, initiation, and return.
- **No Clear Archetype**: Stories with ambiguous character roles.

**Exclusion Rules**:
- **Hero**: When the "Hero" archetype is identified, exclude the "Forbidden Knowledge" narrative arc.

### 3. Protagonist Examination
Protagonist examination distinguishes between types of protagonists:

- **Dynamic Protagonist**: A character who evolves throughout the story.
- **Static Protagonist**: A character whose fundamental traits remain unchanged.

**Exclusion Rules**:
- **Dynamic Protagonist**: When identifying a dynamic protagonist, exclude the "Fable" narrative arc.

### 4. Allegory Interpretation
Allegory involves understanding deeper meanings in narratives, often related to:

- **Social Commentary**: Critique on societal norms or issues.
- **Moral Lessons**: Ethical or moral teachings.
- **No Allegory**: Stories without hidden meanings.
- **Allegorical Elements Present**: Stories containing symbolic elements.

**Exclusion Rules**:
- **Allegorical Elements Present**: When allegorical elements are present, exclude the "Fable" narrative arc.

### 5. Narrative Voice Analysis
Examining narrative voice involves identifying the perspective from which a story is told:

- **Subjective**: A personal view with emotions and opinions.
- **Objective**: A detached and factual perspective.
- **Mixed**: Combines subjective and objective elements.
- **Unreliable Narrator**: Storytellers whose credibility is compromised.
- **Reliable Narrator**: Narrators perceived as trustworthy.

**Exclusion Rules**:
- **Unreliable Narrator**: When identified, exclude the "Fable" and "Epic" narrative arcs.

### 6. Plot Structure Analysis
Breaking down the plot structure involves examining the narrative's pacing and sequence:

- **(0, 25)**: Initial setup and exposition.
- **(26, 50)**: Development and rising action.
- **(51, 75)**: Climax and major turning points.
- **(76, 100)**: Resolution and conclusion.

**Exclusion Rules**:
- **(0, 25)** and **(26, 50)**: In these plot structure portions, exclude the "Epic" narrative arc.
- **(51, 75)** and **(76, 100)**: In these plot structure portions, exclude the "Fable" narrative arc.

## Conclusion

By following this guidebook, readers and analysts can methodically approach narrative analysis by identifying key elements and understanding how they interact and influence the overarching narrative arcs. The exclusion rules provided ensure a clear distinction between different types of narratives, enabling a more nuanced interpretation and appreciation of stories.
