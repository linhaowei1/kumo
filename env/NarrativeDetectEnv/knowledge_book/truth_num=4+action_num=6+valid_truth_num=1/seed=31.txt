## Plot Structure Analysis Techniques

### 1. Setting Analysis
"Setting Analysis" examines the narrative environment—urban, rural, fantasy, historical, contemporary, futuristic, or fantasy worlds. Based on the setting, certain narrative arcs can be ruled out:

- **Rural** settings exclude "Rags to Riches."
- **Futuristic**, **Fantasy World**, and **No Specific Setting** rule out "Historical."

### 2. Dialogue Dissection
This technique scrutinizes the proportion of dialogue within the narrative to determine the narrative arc:

- Dialogue comprising **0-25%** excludes "Drama."
- Dialogue comprising **51-100%** excludes "Rags to Riches."

### 3. Structural Breakdown
Analyzing the structure, like act structure or chapter divisions, helps differentiate narratives:

- A narrative with **No Clear Structure** rules out "Metamorphosis."

### 4. Genre Classification
Classifying a narrative's genre can assist in narrowing down probable arcs:

- "Realism" excludes "Metamorphosis."

### 5. Literary Devices Exploration
Evaluating the usage level of literary devices—heavy, moderate, or minimal—also plays a role:

- **Minimal Use** rules out "Rags to Riches."

### 6. Symbolism Interpretation
The presence and type of symbolism provide insight into excluding specific arcs:

- **Animal Symbols** exclude "Metamorphosis."
