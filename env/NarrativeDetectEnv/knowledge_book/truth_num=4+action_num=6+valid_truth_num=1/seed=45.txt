# Narrative Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Narrative Analysis Guidebook, a comprehensive resource designed to explore narrative arcs and the analytical techniques used to understand them. This guidebook introduces four popular narrative arcs and explains six plot structure analysis techniques. Additionally, it outlines specific scenarios where certain narrative arcs are excluded based on observed characteristics.

## Chapter 1: Understanding Narrative Arcs

### 1.1 Picaresque Journey
A "Picaresque Journey" narrative arc typically follows a roguish but appealing protagonist as they embark on a series of adventures. These stories often feature a loose, episodic structure and provide social commentary through the protagonist's encounters.

### 1.2 Power Struggle
The "Power Struggle" narrative arc centers around conflicts for dominance, authority, or control. Protagonists in these stories might engage in battles—metaphorical or literal—as they vie for power within a specific setting or situation.

### 1.3 Family Saga
A "Family Saga" explores the lives, intricate relationships, and dynamics of a family over an extended period. These narratives often delve deep into generational conflicts and personal growth against a backdrop of historical or societal changes.

### 1.4 Fairy Tale
The "Fairy Tale" narrative arc often embodies magical or fantastical elements, addressing themes of good versus evil, moral lessons, and the triumph of good-hearted protagonists against adversity.

## Chapter 2: Plot Structure Analysis Techniques

### 2.1 Setting Analysis
This technique evaluates the setting of a narrative, aiming to uncover how the time and place influence the story's events and character development. Recognizing the exclusions within setting analyses is crucial:

- **Urban settings** do not typically suit a **Picaresque Journey**.
- **Rural settings** are not aligned with **Power Struggles**.
- **Contemporary settings** are incongruous with **Fairy Tales**.

### 2.2 Narrative Style Analysis
Here, the focus is on identifying the narrative style and understanding its effect on storytelling. Particular styles exclude certain arcs:

- **Stream of Consciousness** does not fit a **Fairy Tale**.
- **Non-linear Narratives** also exclude **Fairy Tales**.

### 2.3 Exposition Analysis
This analysis examines how information is presented at the story's onset. It can affect which narrative arcs are ruled out:

- If the exposition constitutes **0-25%** of the narrative, a **Family Saga** is unlikely.

### 2.4 Tone and Mood Assessment
This technique assesses the emotional quality of a narrative. Certain tones and moods can rule out narrative arcs:

- A **Pessimistic** tone excludes **Fairy Tales**.

### 2.5 Narrative Perspective Study
This analysis reviews the point of view through which the story is told. Specific perspectives may exclude certain arcs:

- **Second Person** and **Multiple POV** perspectives are not typical for **Fairy Tales**.

### 2.6 Subplot Analysis
This involves examining the presence and complexity of subplots within a narrative. The number of subplots can exclude certain arcs:

- **0-2 subplots** mean a **Family Saga** is not suitable.
