# Narrative Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
Understanding narrative arcs and employing effective analysis techniques are crucial for dissecting stories and uncovering deeper meanings within them. This guidebook introduces various narrative arcs and provides a detailed framework for analyzing plot structures using different techniques. Each section will present an overview of the narrative arc or analysis technique, followed by an explanation of how exclusions apply to rule out certain arcs based on observed outcomes.

## Narrative Arcs

### 1. Psychological Thriller
Psychological thrillers delve into the complex and often sinister workings of the human mind. These narratives typically involve suspense and tension as characters confront internal or external psychological conflicts. The story unfolds to reveal the intricacies of the characters’ psyches and motivations.

### 2. Man vs. Self
This narrative arc focuses on internal conflict, where the protagonist grapples with their own thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. It is the journey of overcoming personal challenges and making decisions that lead to growth or self-destruction.

### 3. Man vs. Technology
In the Man vs. Technology arc, the conflict stems from the protagonist's interaction with technology, which could be an oppressive system, advanced machinery, or artificial intelligence. The story explores the impacts of technological advancements on humanity and individual freedom.

### 4. Loss of Innocence
This arc captures the transition from naivety to knowledge, typically involving a young protagonist who experiences a pivotal event that leads to a loss of innocence. It reflects on the growth and disillusionment that accompany this transformation.

## Plot Structure Analysis Techniques

### 1. Conflict Identification
**Objective**: Identify the central conflict in the narrative, determining whether it is internal or external.

**Exclusions**:
- **Man vs. Man**: When this conflict is identified, “Man vs. Self” and “Man vs. Technology” arcs are ruled out.
- **Man vs. Society**: When this conflict arises, the “Man vs. Self” arc is ruled out.

### 2. Narrative Perspective Study
**Objective**: Examine the point of view from which the story is told (e.g., first person, third person, omniscient, etc.).

**Exclusions**:
- **First Person**: With this perspective, the “Loss of Innocence” arc is ruled out.

### 3. Foreshadowing Detection
**Objective**: Determine whether foreshadowing is used to hint at future events in the narrative.

**Exclusions**:
- **No Foreshadowing**: If no foreshadowing is present, the “Psychological Thriller” arc is ruled out.

### 4. Narrative Style Analysis
**Objective**: Analyze the narrative style, including its structure and flow (e.g., linear, non-linear, stream of consciousness).

**Exclusions**:
- **Linear Narrative**: When a linear narrative is observed, the “Psychological Thriller” arc is ruled out.

### 5. Character Development Analysis
**Objective**: Assess how characters evolve throughout the story, quantifying their development along a scale.

**Exclusions**:
- **Development Scale (0-25%)**: If character development is within this range, the “Psychological Thriller” arc is ruled out.

### 6. Plot Structure Analysis
**Objective**: Evaluate the overall composition and organization of the plot to understand its dynamics.

**Exclusions**:
- **Plot Development (0-25%)** and **(26-50%)**: When the plot falls into these ranges of development, the “Psychological Thriller” arc is ruled out for both.
