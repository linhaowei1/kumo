# Narrative Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Narrative Analysis Guidebook, your essential resource for exploring and understanding various narrative arcs and plot structure analysis techniques. This guide provides a comprehensive introduction to four key narrative arcs and explains how different plot structure analysis techniques can be used to dissect and interpret stories. Additionally, we highlight situations where certain narrative arcs can be excluded based on specific analyses.

## Narrative Arcs

Narrative arcs are the underlying frameworks that shape the development and resolution of a story. Here, we introduce four distinctive arcs:

1. **Contemporary Arc**: 
   - Focuses on modern settings and themes, reflecting current societal issues or personal experiences. Stories often revolve around relatable events or dilemmas.

2. **Redemption Arc**:
   - Involves a protagonist's transformation from a state of wrongdoing or failure to one of moral or spiritual renewal. Redemption stories often highlight themes of forgiveness and personal growth.

3. **Play Arc**:
   - Emphasizes light-heartedness, joy, and the spontaneous nature of storytelling. These narratives are typically humorous and convey a sense of amusement or whimsy.

4. **Adventure Arc**:
   - Centers on exciting journeys and quests, often involving challenges and discoveries. Adventure arcs are characterized by dynamic settings and bold action.

## Plot Structure Analysis Techniques

Plot structure analysis techniques allow us to break down and understand the components of a narrative. Each technique can reveal insights into the story's construction and meaning:

### 1. Setting Analysis
   - Involves examining the time and place (setting) in which a story unfolds. Different settings can influence the mood and direction of the narrative.
   - **Exclusions**:
     - Historical settings rule out the 'Contemporary' arc.
     - Fantasy Worlds and No Specific Setting are exclusions for 'Contemporary.'

### 2. Dialogue Dissection
   - Focuses on analyzing characters' speech to understand their motivations, relationships, and dynamics within the story.
   - **Exclusions**:
     - Scene/dialogue density between 0% and 25% rules out the 'Play' arc.

### 3. Imagery Analysis
   - Examines descriptive language that creates visual, auditory, or sensory impressions to enhance a readerâ€™s experience.
   - **Exclusions**:
     - High levels of imagery (76%-100%) exclude the 'Adventure' arc.

### 4. Foreshadowing Detection
   - Identifies hints or clues about events that will occur later in the narrative, creating anticipation or building suspense.
   - **Exclusions**:
     - Strong foreshadowing excludes the 'Adventure' arc.

### 5. Tone and Mood Assessment
   - Analyzes the emotional atmosphere of a story and how it is conveyed through language, style, and perspective.
   - **Exclusions**:
     - A dark tone and mood exclude the 'Redemption' arc.

### 6. Falling Action Analysis
   - Observes the events following the story's climax, leading towards its resolution, where conflicts are typically settled.
   - **Exclusions**:
     - Levels of falling action between 51% to 75% and 76% to 100% exclude the 'Adventure' arc.
