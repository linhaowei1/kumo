## Introduction

This guidebook provides a comprehensive analysis of various abilities and the corresponding tests used to assess them. Our aim is to deliver insights into how these abilities can be evaluated and understood through structured testing. The guide highlights the direct relationship between specific tests and the abilities inferred based on different outcomes. Importantly, it adopts an exclusionary approachâ€”outlining abilities that are definitively not lacking when particular outcomes are observed.
