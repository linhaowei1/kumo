## Movement Patterns and Technique Analysis

In this section, we will analyze various movement patterns and what each means for ruling out different martial arts styles:

### 1. **Ground Fighting Technique Observation**

- **Extensive Ground Fighting**: When extensive ground fighting techniques are observed, rule out **Kickboxing** as it is the only style in this category.
  
- **Some Ground Fighting**: If some ground fighting techniques are observed, rule out **Silat**.
  
- **No Ground Fighting**: This outcome does not rule out any styles, as no specific martial art is identified by an absence of ground fighting.

### 2. **Competition Rules Examination**

- **Strict Rules**: No styles are specifically excluded by strict competition rules, as no martial art fits this category.

- **Moderate Rules**: When moderate competition rules are observed, exclude **Kickboxing**.

- **No Competition**: This outcome does not rule out any styles.

### 3. **Physical Conditioning Observation**

- **High Fitness Levels (80-100)**: Observing this level of physical conditioning rules out **Qigong**, as it is primarily non-competitive and health-focused rather than conditioning-centric.
  
- **Moderate Fitness Levels (50-80)**: This range does not rule out any styles.

- **Low Fitness Levels (0-50)**: No styles are excluded based on low-level physical conditioning.

### 4. **Elbow Strike Analysis**

- **Frequent Elbow Strikes**: When frequent elbow strikes are noted, no specific martial arts styles are excluded.

- **Occasional Elbow Strikes**: Presence of occasional elbow strikes rules out **Silat**.
  
- **No Elbow Strikes**: This outcome does not exclude any styles.

### 5. **Balance Stability Test**

- **High Stability (80-100)**: This range does not rule out any martial arts styles.
  
- **Moderate Stability (50-80)**: Observing moderate stability results in ruling out **Kickboxing**.
  
- **Low Stability (0-50)**: No styles are excluded based on low stability levels.

### 6. **Multi-Opponent Tactics Observation**

- **Trains for Multiple Opponents**: Observing training for multiple opponents excludes both **Kickboxing** and **Savate**.

- **Occasional Multi-Opponent Training**: This observation does not rule out any styles.

- **Focuses on Single Opponent**: No styles are excluded here.
