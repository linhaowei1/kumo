# Astronomical Analysis Guidebook: Star Classifications and Spectral Analysis Techniques

This guidebook aims to introduce and explain a subset of star classifications and the corresponding spectral analysis techniques used to study them. We will explore how each technique helps rule out certain star types based on observational outcomes. By the end of this guide, you will understand how different spectral analysis techniques assist in narrowing down the types of stars being observed.

## Star Classifications

1. **Y-type Brown Dwarf**: These are cool and faint sub-stellar objects that are not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion in their cores. Y-type Brown Dwarfs lie between stars and gas giant planets in terms of mass and temperature.

2. **F-type Main Sequence Stars**: These stars are part of the main sequence phase where they fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores. F-type stars are known for having strong hydrogen and metal lines in their spectra.

3. **Extreme Helium Stars**: A rare class of stars where helium is far more abundant than hydrogen in the atmosphere. These stars are lacking in many of the typical spectral lines associated with other stars.

4. **Non-magnetic Stars**: These are stars that exhibit no significant magnetic fields. Their polarizations and other spectral line measurements often reflect this absence of magnetic activity.

## Spectral Line Analyses

### Mass Estimation

- **Objective**: To estimate the mass of celestial objects.
- **Outcomes & Rule-out Implications**:
  - If the estimated mass is between 0 and 0.5 solar masses, F-type main sequence stars can be ruled out.
  - A mass between 0.5 and 1.0 solar masses does not exclude any star type.
  - Should the mass range from 1.0 to 10 solar masses, Y-type Brown Dwarfs can be excluded.
  - A mass between 10 and 100 solar masses rules out F-type main sequence stars.

### Polarization Measurement

- **Objective**: To measure the degree of light polarization, which can indicate the presence or absence of magnetic fields or scattering effects.
- **Outcomes & Rule-out Implications**:
  - High polarization measurements allow us to exclude Non-magnetic stars.
  - Low polarization levels do not exclude any star type.

### Astroseismology

- **Objective**: To detect oscillations in stars, which provide insights into their internal structures.
- **Outcomes & Rule-out Implications**:
  - If oscillations are detected, no specific exclusions can be made.
  - The absence of oscillations rules out Extreme helium stars.

### Spectral Line Measurement

- **Objective**: To identify the types of lines present in a star's spectrum.
- **Outcomes & Rule-out Implications**:
  - Strong hydrogen lines observed do not lead to any exclusions.
  - Observing strong helium lines or strong molecular bands excludes F-type main sequence stars.
  - The presence of emission lines also rules out F-type main sequence stars.
  - No significant metrics exclude any specific star type.

### Color Index Measurement

- **Objective**: To determine the color index, which helps describe a star's temperature and spectral characteristics.
- **Outcomes & Rule-out Implications**:
  - A color index from -0.4 to 0.0 results in no exclusions.
  - A color index from 0.0 to 1.5 does not exclude any star type.
  - An index from 1.5 to 3.0 rules out F-type main sequence stars.

### Magnetic Field Measurement

- **Objective**: To measure the strength of a star's magnetic field.
- **Outcomes & Rule-out Implications**:
  - A magnetic field in the range of 0 to 1000.0 Gauss does not rule out any star type.
  - Observing a magnetic field strength between 1000.0 and 1,000,000.0 Gauss excludes F-type main sequence stars.
  - Fields in the range of 1,000,000.0 to 1,000,000,000.0 Gauss do not exclude any star type.

This guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of how various spectral analysis results inform our understanding of different star types. Each technique, when used to observe specific outcomes, enables astronomers to systematically exclude particular star classifications from consideration, thereby refining their search and analysis of celestial objects.
