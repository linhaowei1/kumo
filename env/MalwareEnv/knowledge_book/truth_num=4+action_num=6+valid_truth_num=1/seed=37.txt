# Malware Analysis Guidebook

In this guidebook, we'll explore specific types of malware and the methods used to detect them. Understanding how each detection method can rule out certain types of malware is vital for improving cybersecurity measures and developing effective defensive strategies.

## Malware Types

1. **Dropper**: A dropper is a type of malware designed to deliver other malicious payloads once it infiltrates the target system. It's like a carrier that releases the actual malware when it reaches its destination.

2. **Ransomware**: This malicious software encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom for the decryption key. Ransomware can devastate individuals and organizations by locking them out of critical data.

3. **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)**: A RAT allows an attacker to take control of an infected computer remotely. This type of malware can access confidential data, manipulate system files, and monitor user activities without their knowledge.

4. **Screen Locker**: This type of malware locks the computer's screen, preventing users from accessing their system. It often mimics ransomware by displaying a message demanding payment to unlock the screen.

## Detection Methods

1. **Packet Capture Analysis**: This method involves monitoring network traffic to detect unusual patterns or unauthorized data transmissions. By capturing and analyzing data packets, security analysts can identify the presence of malicious activity.
   - **No Suspicious Traffic**: Cannot rule out any malware.
   - **Unencrypted Data Sent**: Cannot rule out any malware.
   - **Encrypted Traffic Detected**: Rules out Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and Ransomware.

2. **Hook Detection**: In this method, analysts check for hooks, which are alterations to the system's API calls that redirect or modify actions.
   - **No Hooks Found**: Cannot rule out any malware.
   - **System Hooks Detected**: Rules out Screen Locker.
   - **API Hooking Detected**: Cannot rule out any malware.

3. **File System Monitoring**: By observing changes to the system files and directories, this method detects unauthorized file creation, modification, or deletion.
   - **No File Changes**: Cannot rule out any malware.
   - **Files Created**: Rules out Ransomware.
   - **Files Encrypted**: Rules out Ransomware.

4. **Code Signature Check**: This method verifies the digital signature of software to determine its legitimacy. It helps confirm whether the software has been tampered with or is known malware.
   - **Known Malware Signature Found**: Cannot rule out any malware.
   - **No Known Signatures Found**: Rules out Ransomware.
   - **Invalid Signature**: Cannot rule out any malware.

5. **String Extraction**: This approach involves examining the textual data within a file or executed process to identify suspicious or recognizable strings associated with malware.
   - **No Strings Found**: Cannot rule out any malware.
   - **Suspicious Strings Found**: Rules out Ransomware.
   - **Only Benign Strings**: Cannot rule out any malware.

6. **Behavioral Analysis**: This method analyzes the behavior of software during its execution to detect malicious activities. The behavior is scored on a scale to assess the potential threat level.
   - **Score between 0.0 and 0.3**: Rules out Ransomware.
   - **Score between 0.31 and 0.7**: Cannot rule out any malware.
   - **Score between 0.71 and 1.0**: Cannot rule out any malware.

By employing these detection methods, cybersecurity professionals can effectively rule out certain types of malware, refining their focus on the remaining potential threats. This process of elimination is crucial for narrowing down the exact nature of a threat, allowing for quicker and more precise countermeasures to protect systems and data.
