## **Malware Analysis Guidebook**

## Introduction

Understanding different types of malware and the methods to detect them is crucial in ensuring the security and integrity of computer systems. This guidebook introduces four common malware types and details various detection methods that can be used to rule out specific malware based on observed system behaviors. 

## Malware Types

### 1. Downloader
Downloaders are a type of malware primarily designed to download and install other malicious software on an infected system. They often gain entry through suspicious email attachments or compromised websites.

### 2. Bootkit
Bootkits are sophisticated malware that infect the boot sector of a computer. Once installed, they are notoriously difficult to detect and remove because they can load before the operating system and bypass security measures.

### 3. Browser Hijacker
Browser hijackers are malware that modifies web browser settings without the user's permission. They often redirect users to unwanted websites and can alter search results, affecting the browsing experience and leading to potential data theft.

### 4. Fileless Malware
Fileless malware operates without leaving traditional traces like files or executable programs on the system. Instead, it resides in system memory or utilizes legitimate tools and system functions to carry out malicious activities.

## Detection Methods

### 1. Registry Analysis
This method involves examining the Windows Registry to detect any suspicious changes typically associated with malware.

- **No Registry Changes**: If no changes are detected, Fileless Malware can be ruled out since it often doesn't alter the registry.
- **Startup Entries Modified**: When startup entries have been altered, Browser Hijacker can be ruled out, as other changes may be evident that go beyond the typical browser focus.

### 2. Event Log Analysis
This involves reviewing event logs for anomalies that may indicate malware presence.

- **No Anomalies**: If no anomalies are present, Fileless Malware is eliminated since it often leaves little to no trace.
- **System Crashes**: Frequent crashes can rule out Bootkit activity, as the presence of crashes indicates that Bootkit is not the culprit.

### 3. Email Header Analysis
Involves analyzing email headers for indications of malicious activities, typically used to identify phishing or cases like downloaders leveraging email.

- **Suspicious Attachments**: If found, this helps rule out Downloaders, as they typically rely on such vectors to initiate infection.

### 4. Driver Inspection
Inspecting the system drivers to check for any modifications or unsigned drivers can be critical for detecting rootkit-like behavior of advanced malware types.

- **Unsigned Drivers Found**: Discovering unsigned drivers can rule out Bootkit, as they often alter startup drivers at the boot level.
- **Modified Drivers**: Similar to unsigned drivers, modifications can rule out Bootkit.

### 5. Hook Detection
Detection of system and API hooks can help identify stealthy malwares attempting to intercept system and application operations.

- **API Hooking Detected**: Presence of API hooks specifically suggests the exclusion of Bootkit, which often uses such techniques to remain undetected.

### 6. YARA Rule Matching
YARA rules are used to identify malware by identifying patterns associated with known threats within files. 

- **No Rules Matched**: If no rules are triggered, this can rule out Fileless Malware, which often doesn't match known file-based signatures.

## Conclusion

Each detection method provides clues about the presence of certain malware types while excluding others. Understanding these exclusion criteria helps to narrow down potential threats and inform focused remediation actions. By adopting a systematic approach to malware detection, security professionals can better protect systems against diverse and evolving threats.
