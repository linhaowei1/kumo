## **Malware Analysis Guidebook**

In this guidebook, we will explore different types of malware and the methods used to detect them. Understanding these concepts is crucial for cybersecurity professionals striving to protect systems from malicious attacks. We will cover four common types of malware and six detection methods, explaining their roles in identifying malware. We'll also discuss how observations from detection methods can help rule out certain types of malware.

## Malware Types

1. **Encrypted Virus**: This type of malware employs encryption to conceal its payload, making it challenging to detect with conventional methods. Encrypted viruses often modify themselves to avoid detection.

2. **Cryptolocker Ransomware**: Known for encrypting the victim's files and demanding a ransom payment for decryption. Unlike viruses, ransomware often does not need to hide its payload via encryption; instead, it uses encryption to harm.

3. **Rootkit**: Malicious software designed to grant unauthorized access and conceal the presence of other malicious software. Rootkits operate at a deep system level, making them difficult to detect and remove.

4. **Screen Locker**: Malware that restricts access to a computer by locking the screen and demanding a ransom or action to unlock it, without necessarily using data encryption.

## Detection Methods

### 1. Compression and Encryption Detection

This method analyzes files for compression and encryption, which are frequently used by malware to conceal contents.

- **No Compression/Encryption**: No malware types are ruled out.
- **Compressed Files Detected**: No malware types are ruled out.
- **Encrypted Payload Found**: The presence of an encrypted payload **excludes Encrypted Virus**, ruling it out as a possibility.

### 2. Hook Detection

This method checks for the presence of hooks within the system. Hooks can alter routine system functions to hide malware activity.

- **No Hooks Found**: No malware types are ruled out.
- **System Hooks Detected**: Excludes **Screen Locker**, ruling it out as a possibility.
- **API Hooking Detected**: Excludes **Rootkit**, ruling it out as a possibility.

### 3. Time Stamp Analysis

This analysis involves checking the consistency of file time stamps. Inconsistencies may signify the presence of malware.

- **Consistent Time Stamps**: Excludes **Encrypted Virus**, ruling it out as a possibility.
- **Time Stamps Mismatch**: Excludes **Rootkit**, ruling it out as a possibility.
- **Modified Time Stamps**: No malware types are ruled out.

### 4. Heuristic Analysis

This method uses heuristic techniques to identify suspicious activity patterns that could indicate malware presence.

- **No Heuristics Matched**: No malware types are ruled out.
- **Suspicious Patterns Found**: No malware types are ruled out.
- **Heuristics Matched**: Excludes **Encrypted Virus**, ruling it out as a possibility.

### 5. Binary Comparison

This involves comparing binaries of suspect files against known safe versions to check for unexpected changes.

- **No Differences Detected**: No malware types are ruled out.
- **Binary Differences Found**: Excludes **Encrypted Virus**, ruling it out as a possibility.
- **File Size Mismatch**: Excludes **Encrypted Virus**, ruling it out as a possibility.

### 6. Static Code Analysis

Static code analysis involves examining the code of a program without executing it, typically identifying obfuscation or unusual patterns.

- **Code is Obfuscated**: Excludes **Rootkit** and **Encrypted Virus**, ruling them out as possibilities.
- **Readable Code**: No malware types are ruled out.
- **No Code Found**: No malware types are ruled out.

## Conclusion

Understanding the exclusions associated with detection outcomes allows cybersecurity professionals to narrow down the types of potential threats more effectively. This nuanced approach helps improve detection accuracy and enhances system defenses against various malware threats.
