# Malware Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to help analyze and identify various types of malware using several detection methods. Understanding the distinct characteristics of each malware type and how they interact with detection mechanisms is crucial for effective defensive strategies.

## Malware Types

### 1. Zero-Day Exploit Malware
Zero-day exploit malware targets vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to vendors. These attacks are particularly dangerous because they exploit security gaps before they can be patched.

### 2. Banking Trojan
Banking Trojans are designed to steal sensitive financial information like banking credentials. They typically operate by intercepting login credentials or creating fake login interfaces.

### 3. Companion Virus
A companion virus attaches itself to legitimate programs, creating a companion executable that is often overlooked by users. These viruses are deceptive by nature, leading users to unwittingly execute the malicious program.

### 4. Malicious Cryptomining
Also known as cryptojacking, this malware hijacks a computer's processing power to mine cryptocurrencies without the user's consent. It can degrade system performance and increase electricity costs.

## Detection Methods

### 1. Network Traffic Analysis
Analyzing network traffic patterns can reveal abnormalities:

- **Anomalous Traffic Detected**: The presence of unusual traffic patterns indicates potential issues.
- **High Outbound Traffic**: May suggest data exfiltration or other suspicious activities.
- **Suspicious DNS Queries**: Can indicate communication with malicious servers, especially relevant for identifying malicious cryptomining.

### 2. Dynamic Analysis in Sandbox
Dynamic analysis involves executing the malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior:

- **Malware Detects Sandbox**: Some sophisticated malware, like zero-day exploits, can detect sandbox environments and alter behavior to avoid detection.
- **Malware Executes Normally**: Observing normal execution helps identify behavioral patterns common to various malware.
- **No Activity Observed**: Indicates a non-executable payload or dormant malware.

### 3. API Call Analysis
API call analysis involves observing the interactions between the malware and the system's API:

- **Suspicious API Calls**: Certain calls can reveal malicious intent, such as those often used by banking Trojans to intercept user data.
- **Normal API Usage**: Indicates that no malicious actions are detected through API interactions.

### 4. DNS Query Analysis
Monitoring DNS queries can unveil malicious behavior:

- **Suspicious Domains Queried**: Points to potentially malicious communications.
- **No Suspicious Queries**: Specifically rules out the presence of malicious cryptomining if no suspicious DNS activity is detected.

### 5. YARA Rule Matching
YARA rules are utilized to identify and categorize malware based on patterns:

- **No Rules Matched**: Indicates potential zero-day malware if no known malware signatures are detected.
- **Known Malware Matched**: Helps identify specific, already recognized malware variants.

### 6. Disk Forensics
Disk forensics involves analyzing disk data for anomalies:

- **Unknown Files Detected**: The presence of unknown or unexpected files can point to companion viruses.
- **No Unusual Files**: Indicates no visible changes on the disk storage.

## Analysis Outcomes and Rule-Out Method

Each detection method yields outcomes that help rule out certain types of malware:

- **Network Traffic Analysis**
  - **Suspicious DNS Queries**: Rules out malicious cryptomining.

- **Dynamic Analysis in Sandbox**
  - **Malware Detects Sandbox**: Rules out zero-day exploit malware.

- **API Call Analysis**
  - **Suspicious API Calls**: Rules out banking Trojans.

- **DNS Query Analysis**
  - **No Suspicious Queries**: Rules out malicious cryptomining.

- **YARA Rule Matching**
  - **No Rules Matched**: Rules out zero-day exploit malware.

- **Disk Forensics**
  - **Unknown Files Detected**: Rules out companion viruses.

By methodically applying these detection methods and evaluating the outcomes, you can effectively rule out certain malware types and narrow down the possibilities, leading to a more precise identification of the threat you are dealing with.
