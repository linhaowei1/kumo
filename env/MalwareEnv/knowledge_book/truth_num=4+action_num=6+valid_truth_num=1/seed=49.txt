# Malware Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook is designed to help analysts understand and utilize specific detection methods for various types of malware. It covers four primary types of malware: Keylogger, Email Worm, Adware, and Rootkit. It also introduces six detection methods: Email Header Analysis, Machine Learning Classification, Hook Detection, SSL/TLS Inspection, Entropy Analysis, and Time Stamp Analysis. Understanding these types and their detection methods can improve your ability to accurately identify and mitigate malware threats.

## Malware Types

1. **Keylogger:**
   - A keylogger is a type of malware that records keystrokes on a computer to gather sensitive information like usernames and passwords.

2. **Email Worm:**
   - An email worm is a self-replicating malware that spreads through email attachments or links, exploiting email systems to propagate across networks.

3. **Adware:**
   - Adware is malware designed to display unwanted advertisements, often clogging user interfaces and monitoring browsing behavior.

4. **Rootkit:**
   - A rootkit is a malware that hides its presence or the presence of other software, often granting unauthorized access to the system and concealing malicious operations.

## Detection Methods and Outcomes

### Email Header Analysis
Email Header Analysis is used to assess the metadata of emails to identify suspicious activities.

- **No Malicious Emails:** 
  - Excludes Email Worm
- **Spoofed Sender Detected:**
  - Excludes Email Worm
- **Suspicious Attachments:**
  - No specific exclusions related to the malware types

### Machine Learning Classification
Machine Learning Classification involves using algorithms to predict the likelihood of malware based on various features.

- **Low Risk Score:**
  - Excludes Adware
- **Medium Risk Score:**
  - No specific exclusions related to the malware types
- **High Risk Score:**
  - Excludes Rootkit

### Hook Detection
Hook Detection identifies if any system or API hooks are in place, which are often used by malware to intercept or modify system operations.

- **No Hooks Found:**
  - Excludes Adware
- **System Hooks Detected:**
  - Excludes Keylogger
- **API Hooking Detected:**
  - Excludes Rootkit

### SSL/TLS Inspection
SSL/TLS Inspection checks the validity of certificates used in network communications, looking for anomalies that may indicate malware.

- **Valid Certificates:**
  - No specific exclusions related to the malware types
- **Self-signed Certificates:**
  - No specific exclusions related to the malware types
- **Expired Certificates:**
  - Excludes Adware

### Entropy Analysis
Entropy Analysis evaluates the randomness in a file's data, which can indicate the presence of compressed or encrypted malware.

- **Entropy between 0.0 and 3.5:**
  - No specific exclusions related to the malware types
- **Entropy between 3.6 and 7.5:**
  - Excludes Adware
- **Entropy between 7.6 and 10.0:**
  - Excludes Rootkit

### Time Stamp Analysis
Time Stamp Analysis compares file timestamps to identify inconsistencies, which can be indicative of malicious tampering.

- **Consistent Time Stamps:**
  - No specific exclusions related to the malware types
- **Time Stamps Mismatch:**
  - Excludes Rootkit
- **Modified Time Stamps:**
  - No specific exclusions related to the malware types

## Conclusion
Understanding how each detection method can help rule out specific types of malware is crucial in robust malware analysis. This guidebook provides a foundation for leveraging detection techniques to effectively narrow down and identify potential threats, enhancing your security posture against various malware types.
