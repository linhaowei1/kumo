# Malware Analysis Guidebook

Malware has become an increasingly significant threat in the digital age, impacting everything from personal devices to large corporate networks. Understanding various types of malware and how to detect them is crucial for maintaining cybersecurity. This guide provides an overview of common malware types and the methods used to detect them, along with a systematic approach to ruling out malware possibilities based on detection outcomes.

## Malware Types

1. **Overwrite Virus**: This type of malware targets files directly by overwriting their content, rendering them unusable. Once a file is infected, it cannot be recovered, as the original content is completely replaced with the virus code.

2. **Trojan Horse**: Named after the ancient Greek tale, Trojan Horses disguise themselves as legitimate software. They are downloaded and executed by unwitting users, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the user's system.

3. **Downloader**: This type of malware exists primarily to download other malicious software onto an infected system. Once it infects a host, it communicates with external servers to bring in additional threats.

4. **Mobile Malware**: This category of malware is specifically designed to target mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. Mobile malware can steal personal information, send unsolicited messages, and more.

## Detection Methods

1. **Disk Forensics**: This process involves examining the storage disk for signs of unusual activity or files. For instance, finding unknown files can suggest the presence of specific malware.

2. **Registry Analysis**: Primarily used on Windows systems, this involves analyzing the system registry. Missing registry keys or unusual modifications can indicate malware infections.

3. **Compression and Encryption Detection**: This technique checks for compressed or encrypted files which might disguise malware. For example, detecting compressed files can help identify downloaders.

4. **Machine Learning Classification**: By analyzing patterns and behavior, machine learning can classify the risk level of potential malware into categories like low, medium, and high risk.

5. **Static Code Analysis**: This involves examining the code of a program without executing it. Readable code and certain characteristics can help in ruling out or confirming suspected Trojan Horses.

6. **File Hash Comparison**: This involves comparing the hash value of a file against known hash values to detect any alterations or infections.

## Detection Outcomes and Rule-Outs

### Disk Forensics

- **No Unusual Files**: Does not rule out any specific malware; continue analysis.
- **Unknown Files Detected**: Rule out **Overwrite Virus**.
- **Hidden Partitions Found**: Does not rule out any specific malware; continue analysis.

### Registry Analysis

- **No Registry Changes**: Rule out **Mobile Malware**.
- **Startup Entries Modified**: Does not rule out any specific malware; continue analysis.
- **Registry Keys Missing**: Rule out **Overwrite Virus**.

### Compression and Encryption Detection

- **No Compression/Encryption**: Rule out **Trojan Horse**.
- **Compressed Files Detected**: Rule out **Downloader**.
- **Encrypted Payload Found**: Does not rule out any specific malware; continue analysis.

### Machine Learning Classification

- **Low Risk Score**: Does not rule out any specific malware; further examination needed.
- **Medium Risk Score**: Rule out **Trojan Horse**.
- **High Risk Score**: Does not rule out any specific malware; further examination needed.

### Static Code Analysis

- **Code is Obfuscated**: Does not rule out any specific malware; further analysis required.
- **Readable Code**: Rule out **Trojan Horse**.
- **No Code Found**: Does not rule out any specific malware; further analysis required.

### File Hash Comparison

- **Hashes Match**: Rule out **Trojan Horse**.
- **Hashes Mismatch**: Does not rule out any specific malware; further analysis required.
- **No Hash Available**: Does not rule out any specific malware; further analysis required.

## Conclusion

By understanding the characteristics and detection methods of various malware types, cybersecurity professionals can effectively analyze and secure systems. Using the outcomes from detection methods to rule out possibilities narrows down the potential threats, streamlining the analysis process. Always approach malware detection with a comprehensive toolkit and stay updated with the latest threat intelligence for best results.
