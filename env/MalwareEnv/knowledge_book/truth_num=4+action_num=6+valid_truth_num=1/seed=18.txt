# Malware Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to assist in understanding different types of malware and how they can be detected through various analytical methods. Specifically, we will explore four types of malware and six detection methods, along with the outcomes that help in ruling out certain types of malware.

## Malware Types

1. **Botnet Malware**: These are networks of infected computers that are controlled by attackers, often used to launch coordinated attacks like DDoS attacks. They are characterized by their silent operations and coordinated network behavior.

2. **Scareware**: This is a type of malware designed to trick users into purchasing fake software by pretending that the computer is infected with a virus. It often uses alarming notifications and pop-ups.

3. **Password Stealer**: This malware targets sensitive information by collecting login credentials and other personal data stored on the computer. It is stealthy and focuses on capturing data without detection.

4. **Wiper Malware**: This destructive malware aims to delete or wipe out data on a target system, often rendering it unusable. It may be used in sabotage campaigns to cause significant disruption.

## Detection Methods and Outcomes

Below, we outline each detection method, the possible outcomes, and their implications for ruling out certain types of malware.

### 1. Event Log Analysis

Event log analysis involves reviewing the logs generated by a computer system to identify suspicious activities.

- **No Anomalies**: This outcome means no significant unusual activity is detected, not ruling out any specific malware type.
  
- **Failed Login Attempts**: If you observe numerous failed login attempts, it suggests the presence of possible intrusions but rules out the presence of **Password Stealer** as it avoids failing login attempts by using accurate credentials.
  
- **System Crashes**: Frequent or unexplained system crashes can point towards the presence of disruptive malware and, in this case, rules out **Wiper Malware** due to typical symptoms.

### 2. Driver Inspection

This method inspects system drivers to identify any modifications or malicious activities.

- **No Malicious Drivers**: When no harmful drivers are identified, it suggests normalcy and rules out **Scareware** because it often uses driver modifications for deceptive alerts.
  
- **Unsigned Drivers Found**: The presence of drivers that are not digitally signed does not rule out any specific malware type.
  
- **Modified Drivers**: Observing modified drivers doesn't suggest any particular malware to be ruled out in this guide.

### 3. Packet Capture Analysis

This technique analyzes network packets to detect any abnormal data communications.

- **No Suspicious Traffic**: In the absence of suspicious network activity, it rules out the presence of **Botnet Malware**, known for coordinating activities over the network.
  
- **Unencrypted Data Sent**: Sending unencrypted data is not enough to rule out any specific malware in this context.
  
- **Encrypted Traffic Detected**: The presence of encrypted traffic also does not rule out any malware type specifically discussed here.

### 4. Hook Detection

Hook detection involves checking for system and API hooks, which are often used by malware to monitor or interfere with system operations.

- **No Hooks Found**: When no hooks are detected, this rules out **Scareware** which might otherwise use hooks to manage system alerts.
  
- **System Hooks Detected**: Detecting system hooks could suggest the operations of certain malware but does not explicitly rule out specific types.
  
- **API Hooking Detected**: Finding API hooking doesn't exclude any definite malware type in this guide.

### 5. DNS Query Analysis

This method assesses DNS queries to uncover potential malicious site connections.

- **No Suspicious Queries**: The lack of concerning DNS queries rules out **Botnet Malware**, which frequently requires external communication to command and control servers.
  
- **High Number of DNS Queries**: An unusually high number of DNS queries may indicate potential data exfiltration or network manipulation, ruling out **Wiper Malware** that typically shuts down operations.
  
- **Suspicious Domains Queried**: If no specific domains are marked suspicious, it doesn’t explicitly rule out any malware type noted here.

### 6. Payload Disassembly

Involves breaking down malware code to study its characteristics and intentions.

- **Cannot Disassemble**: A failure to disassemble doesn’t rule out particular malware types here.
  
- **Partial Disassembly**: A partial understanding of code structure fails to rule out any specific types.

- **Full Disassembly**: Being able to fully disassemble the code means excluding **Scareware**, as it’s frequently designed to obfuscate or mislead analysis tools.

By applying these detection methods and understanding their outcomes, analysts can effectively narrow down potential threats, focusing remediation efforts more precisely on the undetected threats. Use this guide during investigations to rule out malware types systematically and enhance your security posture.
