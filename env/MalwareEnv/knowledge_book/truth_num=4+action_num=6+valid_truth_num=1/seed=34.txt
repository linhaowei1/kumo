## **Malware Analysis Guidebook**

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, identifying and understanding different types of malware is crucial. This guide introduces some common types of malware and their corresponding detection methods, focusing on how these methods help rule out certain types of malware based on observed outcomes.

## Malware Types

### Cryptolocker Ransomware
Cryptolocker is a type of ransomware known for encrypting files on a target system and demanding payment for decryption. It can cause significant harm to individuals and businesses by denying access to crucial data until the ransom is paid.

### Email Worm
An email worm is a type of malware that spreads itself through email attachments or links. Once it infects a machine, it accesses the user's contact list to send itself to new recipients, potentially infecting a wide range of devices quickly.

### Banking Trojan
Banking Trojans are designed to steal financial information, such as online banking credentials. They often achieve this by exploiting vulnerabilities in web browsers or filtering legitimate communication between users and financial institutions.

### Mobile Malware
This malware targets mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. It can steal personal information, send unauthorized messages, or even control the device remotely. As mobile devices become more integral to daily life, the threat posed by mobile malware continues to grow.

## Detection Methods and Outcomes

1. **Registry Analysis**
   - **No Registry Changes**: If no changes are observed in the system registry, Mobile Malware can be ruled out.
   - **Startup Entries Modified**: This condition does not help in ruling out any specified malware type.
   - **Registry Keys Missing**: No exclusion of malware types applies here.

2. **File System Monitoring**
   - **No File Changes**: This circumstance does not help in ruling out any specified malware.
   - **Files Created**: No malware types are excluded when files are merely created.
   - **Files Encrypted**: When files are encrypted, Cryptolocker Ransomware can be ruled out.

3. **API Call Analysis**
   - **Suspicious API Calls**: Observing suspicious API calls rules out Banking Trojans, which typically engage in such activities for data theft.
   - **Normal API Usage**: No malware types are excluded with normal API usage.
   - **API Hooking Detected**: This outcome does not exclude any particular malware types.

4. **Email Header Analysis**
   - **No Malicious Emails**: If no malicious emails are found, Email Worms can be ruled out, as they rely on email propagation.
   - **Spoofed Sender Detected**: Detecting a spoofed sender rules out Email Worms.
   - **Suspicious Attachments**: There are no exclusions associated with detecting suspicious attachments.

5. **Payload Disassembly**
   - **Cannot Disassemble**: Absence of disassembly does not pertain to any exclusions.
   - **Partial Disassembly**: There are no malware types ruled out by observing partial disassembly.
   - **Full Disassembly**: Full disassembly does not help exclude certain malware types.

6. **Network Traffic Analysis**
   - **No Anomalous Traffic**: An absence of anomalous traffic fails to rule out any particular malware types.
   - **Anomalous Traffic Detected**: Detection of anomalous traffic does not deal with any specific exclusions.
   - **High Outbound Traffic**: High outbound traffic observations do not eliminate any malware types.
   - **Suspicious DNS Queries**: Detection of suspicious DNS queries doesnâ€™t imply any exclusions.
