## Malware Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

Malware, or malicious software, can take many forms, each with unique characteristics and behaviors. Detecting and analyzing these threats is crucial for system security and integrity. This guidebook introduces several common malware types and detection methods, and explains how certain observations can help rule out specific malware as possibilities.

## Malware Types

Understanding the different types of malware is key to securing systems. Here are the malware types we will focus on:

1. **Browser Hijacker**: This malware alters browser settings, redirects users to unwanted websites, and can display advertisements without consent. It often modifies startup entries and utilizes common ports.

2. **Anti-Antivirus Malware**: Designed to disable or evade detection by antivirus software, this malware can resist traditional scanning methods. It may detect when it's running in a sandbox and utilize techniques like API hooking to obscure its activity.

3. **Downloader**: This type of malware phases its attack by first installing a small program to download more dangerous malware or files onto a system. It’s commonly associated with the creation of new files in a file system.

4. **Malicious Cryptomining**: Utilizes a victim’s computing resources to mine cryptocurrency. It may not exhibit obvious changes in the system but can be associated with unusual network traffic, such as high outbound traffic or suspicious DNS queries.

## Detection Methods

Different techniques can be utilized to detect the presence of malware. Here's a breakdown of some widely-used detection methods:

1. **Network Traffic Analysis**: This involves monitoring data being sent and received on the network to detect unwanted or unexpected activities. Observing suspicious DNS queries can help rule out malicious cryptomining activity. However, the absence of anomalous traffic, detection of anomalous traffic, or high outbound traffic does not rule out any specific malware types.

2. **Registry Analysis**: Registry changes often accompany malware, but each type exhibits different modifications. If startup entries are modified, a Browser Hijacker can be ruled out. However, no registry changes or missing registry keys do not rule out any specific malware types.

3. **File System Monitoring**: Involves keeping track of file creation, deletion, or modification on a system. The creation of new files can rule out Downloader malware. However, observing no file changes or file encryption does not sufficiently rule out any other types.

4. **Dynamic Analysis in Sandbox**: Executing malware in a controlled environment (sandbox) to observe behaviors. If the malware detects the sandbox, it is likely to be Anti-Antivirus Malware and can be ruled out in such cases. Normal execution of malware or lack of observed activity does not provide strong exclusions.

5. **Port Scanning**: This method checks open ports for unusual activities. If common ports are open, Browser Hijacker can be ruled out. However, the absence of open ports or the presence of unusual ports does not rule out any specific malware types.

6. **API Call Analysis**: This involves reviewing which API calls a program is making. If API hooking is detected, Anti-Antivirus Malware can be ruled out. However, detecting suspicious API calls or observing normal API usage does not provide specific exclusions for other types.

## Applying Detection Methods to Rule Out Malware Types

Understanding which observations allow specific malware types to be ruled out is vital during assessment. This approach helps narrow down the potential threats effectively:

- **Network Traffic Analysis**:
  - *Suspicious DNS Queries*: Malicious Cryptomining is ruled out.

- **Registry Analysis**:
  - *Startup Entries Modified*: Browser Hijacker is ruled out.

- **File System Monitoring**:
  - *Files Created*: Downloader is ruled out.

- **Dynamic Analysis in Sandbox**:
  - *Malware Detects Sandbox*: Anti-Antivirus Malware is ruled out.

- **Port Scanning**:
  - *Common Ports Open*: Browser Hijacker is ruled out.

- **API Call Analysis**:
  - *API Hooking Detected*: Anti-Antivirus Malware is ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guidebook has outlined key malware types and their detection methods, with an emphasis on how certain outcomes help rule out specific malware types. Armed with this knowledge, security professionals can more effectively assess and mitigate potential threats, ensuring systems remain secure and operational.
