## Malware Analysis Guidebook

Understanding different types of malware and how to detect them is crucial for maintaining cybersecurity. This guide aims to introduce some common types of malware and the methods used to detect them. Furthermore, we will explore how specific detection outcomes can help rule out certain malware types.

## Malware Types

### 1. Cryptolocker Ransomware
Cryptolocker is a type of ransomware that encrypts files on the victim's computer, making them inaccessible unless a ransom is paid. This malware is characterized by its file encryption capabilities.

### 2. Adware
Adware is software that automatically displays or downloads advertising material when a user is online. While it is not as destructive as other malware types, it can affect user experience and compromise privacy.

### 3. Rogue Security Software
Rogue security software pretends to be legitimate antivirus or security software. It often generates several security alerts to prompt users into purchasing fake software.

### 4. Anti-Antivirus Malware
This malware is designed to disable or evade antivirus programs, thus allowing other malicious software to operate undetected on the infected system.

## Detection Methods

### 1. File System Monitoring
This involves checking for changes in the file system, such as the creation, modification, or encryption of files.

- **No File Changes:** When no file changes are observed, no malware types are ruled out.
- **Files Created:** Observing file creations does not rule out any specific malware type by itself.
- **Files Encrypted:** Observing encrypted files rules out Cryptolocker Ransomware, as it is excluded based on this outcome.

### 2. Port Scanning
Port scanning examines which communication ports are open, which can indicate the presence of certain malware.

- **No Open Ports:** Lack of open ports does not rule out any specific malware.
- **Common Ports Open:** The presence of common open ports rules out Adware, which often uses common ports for its operations.
- **Unusual Ports Open:** Observing unusual open ports does not specifically rule out any malware type.

### 3. Hook Detection
This method checks for the presence of hooks in the system that malware may use to intercept system calls.

- **No Hooks Found:** If no hooks are detected, Rogue Security Software and Adware can be ruled out, as they are excluded based on this outcome.
- **System Hooks Detected:** Detecting system hooks does not rule out specific malware.
- **API Hooking Detected:** Observing API hooking rules out Anti-Antivirus Malware, as it is excluded based on this outcome.

### 4. Registry Analysis
This involves analyzing changes to the Windows registry, which can indicate malware modifications.

- **No Registry Changes:** Lack of registry changes does not rule out any malware.
- **Startup Entries Modified:** If startup entries are modified, Adware can be ruled out, as it is excluded based on this outcome.
- **Registry Keys Missing:** Missing registry keys do not rule out any specific malware.

### 5. Entropy Analysis
Entropy analysis measures the randomness in files, helping identify potentially compressed or encrypted malware.

- **Entropy (0.0, 3.5):** Low entropy suggests no specific malware is ruled out.
- **Entropy (3.6, 7.5):** Moderate entropy can rule out Adware, as it is excluded based on this outcome.
- **Entropy (7.6, 10.0):** High entropy does not rule out any specific malware.

### 6. Driver Inspection
This process checks for malicious or unauthorized system drivers.

- **No Malicious Drivers:** The absence of malicious drivers rules out Rogue Security Software, as it is excluded based on this outcome.
- **Unsigned Drivers Found:** Finding unsigned drivers does not rule out any specific malware.
- **Modified Drivers:** Observing modified drivers does not specifically rule out any malware type.

By utilizing these detection methods, analysts can effectively narrow down the presence of certain malware types within a system. This guide provides a clear framework to understand how various malware can be identified and excluded based on detection outcomes. Remember, a comprehensive approach combining multiple detection methods often yields the best results in malware analysis.
