# Malware Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is intended to provide clear and straightforward information on various types of malware and the methods used to detect them. The analysis focuses on four specific types of malware and six detection methods. Understanding these concepts will aid in effectively analyzing and mitigating threats within a computing environment.

## Malware Types

### 1. Logic Bomb
A logic bomb is a piece of malicious code that is triggered by a specific event or condition. This type of malware remains dormant within a system until an event occurs, such as a specific date or the completion of a certain number of transactions.

### 2. Spyware
Spyware is malware designed to gather information about a person or organization without their knowledge, and send it to another entity without consent. This can include monitoring keystrokes, capturing passwords, or other sensitive data.

### 3. Command and Control Malware
This type of malware, often part of a botnet, allows an attacker to communicate with infected devices and control them remotely. Attackers use this to distribute commands to carry out malicious activities, such as data theft or deploying further attacks.

### 4. Phishing Malware
Phishing malware is associated with scams usually initiated via email, aiming to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, or to download malicious software. It often involves deceptive communication masquerading as a trustworthy entity.

## Detection Methods

### 1. Packet Capture Analysis
This method involves monitoring and inspecting network traffic to detect anomalies or indications of malicious activity. The results of packet capture analysis can help exclude certain types of malware:

- **No Suspicious Traffic:** Command and Control Malware is ruled out.
- **Unencrypted Data Sent:** Spyware is ruled out.
- **Encrypted Traffic Detected:** No specific malware types are ruled out.

### 2. Email Header Analysis
This technique involves examining the headers of email messages to detect signs of fraudulent activity or phishing attempts.

- **No Malicious Emails:** Phishing Malware is ruled out.
- **Spoofed Sender Detected:** Phishing Malware is ruled out.
- **Suspicious Attachments:** No specific malware types are ruled out.

### 3. SSL/TLS Inspection
This method involves analyzing SSL/TLS certificates used in encrypted communications to check for authenticity and anomalies.

- **Valid Certificates:** No specific malware types are ruled out.
- **Self-signed Certificates:** Command and Control Malware is ruled out.
- **Expired Certificates:** Spyware is ruled out.

### 4. Dynamic Analysis in Sandbox
This involves running the suspected malware in a controlled environment (sandbox) to observe its behavior without risking the actual systems.

- **Malware Executes Normally:** No specific malware types are ruled out.
- **Malware Detects Sandbox:** No specific malware types are ruled out.
- **No Activity Observed:** Logic Bomb is ruled out.

### 5. Event Log Analysis
This method involves reviewing logs generated by the operating system or applications to find evidence of suspicious activity or system compromise.

- **No Anomalies:** Spyware is ruled out.
- **Failed Login Attempts:** Phishing Malware is ruled out.
- **System Crashes:** No specific malware types are ruled out.

### 6. Behavioral Analysis
Analyzing the behavior of a suspected program can help in identifying the presence and type of malware through observed actions.

- **Behavioral Scores between 0.0 and 0.3:** Spyware is ruled out.
- **Behavioral Scores between 0.31 and 0.7:** No specific malware types are ruled out.
- **Behavioral Scores between 0.71 and 1.0:** No specific malware types are ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guidebook has introduced key malware types and outlined detection methods that can be used to rule out certain threats. By carefully analyzing outcomes from different detection methods, analysts can focus on identifying and mitigating the actual threat posed by various malware types.
