# Malware Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction to Malware Types

### 1. Cryptoworm
Cryptoworms are a type of malware designed to propagate across networks and systems by exploiting vulnerabilities without user intervention. They often encrypt files and demand a ransom for the decryption key, causing significant disruption.

### 2. Fileless Malware
Fileless malware is a sophisticated type of malicious software that operates in memory rather than relying on files saved to disk. This makes it particularly challenging to detect using traditional file-based detection methods.

### 3. Browser Hijacker
Browser hijackers alter your web browser's settings, redirecting your search queries and displaying unwanted ads. They can often lead users to malicious websites while collecting data for nefarious purposes.

### 4. Virus
Viruses are a common type of malware that attach themselves to legitimate programs or files. They replicate and spread to other programs and systems, causing damage or disruption.

## Detection Methods and Rule-Out Outcomes

Understanding the potential presence of various malware types requires employing different detection methods. These methods help identify and rule out the specific types of malware based on their operational characteristics. Below is a detailed look at each detection method and the associated rule-out outcomes.

### 1. File System Monitoring
File System Monitoring observes changes in the file system to detect malware activity.

- **No File Changes Observed:** When no file changes are detected, _Fileless Malware_ can be ruled out, as this type does not leave a trace on the file system.
- **Files Created:** Observing new files being created rules out the possibility of a _Virus_, which is known for replication and creating multiple copies.
- **Files Encrypted:** When files are found encrypted, _Cryptoworm_ is ruled out because it is known for file encryption activities.

### 2. Port Scanning
Port scanning checks for open network ports and can identify unusual network activity associated with malware.

- **No Open Ports:** Detecting no open ports does not immediately exclude any specific type of malware.
- **Common Ports Open:** If common ports are open, a _Browser Hijacker_ can be ruled out as it typically targets specific ports for its activities.
- **Unusual Ports Open:** Unusual ports left open do not directly exclude any particular malware type.

### 3. YARA Rule Matching
YARA rule matching uses predefined patterns to identify malware based on files and system behaviors.

- **No Rules Matched:** _Fileless Malware_ is ruled out when no YARA rules match, as it does not leave typical file traces that YARA rules usually identify.
- **Known Malware Matched:** This outcome does not automatically exclude any malware type.
- **Suspicious Patterns Matched:** No specific malware type is ruled out with suspicious pattern matches.

### 4. Entropy Analysis
Entropy analysis measures the randomness in files to detect possible encryption or packing.

- **Entropy Range (0.0, 3.5):** A low entropy score does not rule out any specific malware type.
- **Entropy Range (3.6, 7.5):** When encountering this entropy range, _Virus_ can be ruled out as it often appears in this range due to regular file structures.
- **Entropy Range (7.6, 10.0):** High entropy alone does not exclude any malware type.

### 5. String Extraction
String extraction involves identifying readable strings within executables or memory that might indicate malware.

- **No Strings Found:** _Fileless Malware_ is ruled out if no strings are found, as it does not reside on disk for string extraction.
- **Suspicious Strings Found:** _Virus_ can be ruled out if suspicious strings are detected since viruses often modify or obfuscate strings.
- **Only Benign Strings:** This outcome does not rule out any specific type of malware.

### 6. Binary Comparison
Binary comparison checks files for differences and alterations indicating malware presence.

- **No Differences Detected:** Not identifying differences does not eliminate any specific malware.
- **Binary Differences Found:** If binary differences are found, a _Virus_ can be ruled out because of its characteristic file alterations.
- **File Size Mismatch:** This observation does not rule out any particular malware type.

## Conclusion
By employing these detection methods and understanding the rule-out outcomes, one can effectively narrow down the possible types of malware present on a system. This guide helps in developing a systematic approach to malware analysis and ensuring a more secure environment against potential threats.
