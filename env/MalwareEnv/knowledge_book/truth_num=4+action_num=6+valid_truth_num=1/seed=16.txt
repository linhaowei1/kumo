# Malware Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

Malware analysis involves understanding and scrutinizing malicious software to mitigate potential threats, protect systems, and enhance cybersecurity strategies. This guidebook provides an introduction to various malware types and detection methods in straightforward language to help you navigate the complexities of malware analysis. The detection method outcomes indicate which malware types can be ruled out based on specific findings.

## Malware Types

1. **Anti-Antivirus Malware:**
   - This type of malware is specifically designed to evade or disable antivirus software. It may employ techniques such as API hooking to alter system operations and bypass detection by security tools.

2. **Wiper Malware:**
   - A particularly destructive form of malware, wiper malware's primary goal is to delete or wipe out data on a victim's system. Its activities often result in system crashes, making recovery difficult if proper backups are not maintained.

3. **Polymorphic Virus:**
   - This type of virus is designed to change its code dynamically to avoid detection by traditional antivirus software. It often makes use of encryption techniques to alter its appearance each time it replicates, making it difficult to analyze and disassemble.

4. **Adware:**
   - This is a less severe form of malware that focuses on displaying unwanted advertisements to users. While it can be annoying and may lead to privacy concerns, adware generally lacks the destructive capabilities of other malware types.

## Detection Methods and Outcomes

### 1. Compression and Encryption Detection
- This method involves analyzing files for signs of compression or encryption, which are often used by malware to hide its true nature.

  **Outcomes:**
  - **No Compression/Encryption**: If no compression or encryption is detected, adware can be ruled out, as it does not typically use these techniques.
  - **Compressed Files Detected**: No specific rule-outs.
  - **Encrypted Payload Found**: If an encrypted payload is found, it rules out the presence of a polymorphic virus, as this type typically uses encryption.

### 2. Hook Detection
- Hook detection looks for malicious alterations in system call functions, which can indicate that software is trying to manipulate how the system operates. 

  **Outcomes:**
  - **No Hooks Found**: If no hooks are found, adware can be ruled out because it does not generally use system hooks.
  - **System Hooks Detected**: No specific rule-outs.
  - **API Hooking Detected**: If API hooking is detected, it rules out the presence of anti-antivirus malware, a common user of such techniques to avoid detection.

### 3. Time Stamp Analysis
- This method checks the creation and modification timestamps of files to detect inconsistencies or suspicious alterations.

  **Outcomes:**
  - **Consistent Time Stamps**: If timestamps are consistent, it rules out a polymorphic virus, which usually modifies timestamps to avoid detection.
  - **Time Stamps Mismatch**: No specific rule-outs.
  - **Modified Time Stamps**: No specific rule-outs.

### 4. Payload Disassembly
- Disassembly involves breaking down the malware code to analyze its components and understand its structure and behavior.

  **Outcomes:**
  - **Cannot Disassemble**: If the payload cannot be disassembled, it rules out a polymorphic virus, as it often changes its code through polymorphism.
  - **Partial Disassembly**: No specific rule-outs.
  - **Full Disassembly**: If full disassembly is achievable, adware can be ruled out as a suspect because it's typically non-complex and easy to analyze.

### 5. Behavioral Analysis
- Observes the behavior of software in a controlled environment to identify unusual or harmful actions.

  **Outcomes:**
  - **Behavior Score (0.0 - 0.3)**: No specific rule-outs.
  - **Behavior Score (0.31 - 0.7)**: If the behavior score falls in this range, adware can be ruled out, indicating less harmful behavior.
  - **Behavior Score (0.71 - 1.0)**: No specific rule-outs.

### 6. Event Log Analysis
- Event logs are examined to detect anomalies, unauthorized access attempts, or system failures.

  **Outcomes:**
  - **No Anomalies**: No specific rule-outs.
  - **Failed Login Attempts**: No specific rule-outs.
  - **System Crashes**: If system crashes are identified in the event log, wiper malware can be ruled out, as it is typically associated with such incidents.
