## Malware Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to introduce you to various types of malware and the methods used to detect them. By understanding these concepts, you will be better equipped to identify and mitigate malware threats. We will focus on four specific types of malware and explore six common detection methods, explaining how each detection method can help to rule out or exclude certain malware types based on the observed outcomes.

## Malware Types

1. **Malicious Cryptomining**
    - This type of malware uses infected systems to mine cryptocurrencies without the user's consent, often leading to increased electricity usage and degraded system performance.

2. **Cryptoworm**
    - A type of self-propagating malware that encrypts files on infected systems, demanding a ransom for decryption. Cryptoworms can spread rapidly across networks.

3. **Keylogger**
    - Keyloggers are designed to secretly record keystrokes on an infected machine, aiming to capture sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers.

4. **Trojan Horse**
    - A Trojan Horse appears to be legitimate software but contains hidden malicious functionality. Trojans can create backdoors for attackers or perform unauthorized modifications on the system.

## Detection Methods and Outcomes

1. **File System Monitoring**
    - This technique observes changes in the file system to detect suspicious activities.
    - **Outcomes:**
        - *No File Changes:* Does not exclude any specific malware types.
        - *Files Created:* Rules out 'Trojan Horse'.
        - *Files Encrypted:* Rules out 'Cryptoworm'.

2. **Binary Comparison**
    - Compares binary files to detect modifications or tampering.
    - **Outcomes:**
        - *No Differences Detected:* Does not exclude any specific malware types.
        - *Binary Differences Found:* Rules out 'Trojan Horse'.
        - *File Size Mismatch:* Does not exclude any specific malware types.

3. **Hook Detection**
    - Identifies the presence of hooks, which can be used to intercept system calls or functions.
    - **Outcomes:**
        - *No Hooks Found:* Does not exclude any specific malware types.
        - *System Hooks Detected:* Rules out 'Keylogger'.
        - *API Hooking Detected:* Does not exclude any specific malware types.

4. **Static Code Analysis**
    - Analyzes code without executing it to identify vulnerabilities or malicious intent.
    - **Outcomes:**
        - *Code is Obfuscated:* Does not exclude any specific malware types.
        - *Readable Code:* Rules out 'Trojan Horse'.
        - *No Code Found:* Does not exclude any specific malware types.

5. **Packet Capture Analysis**
    - Monitors network traffic to identify suspicious data transmissions.
    - **Outcomes:**
        - *No Suspicious Traffic:* Does not exclude any specific malware types.
        - *Unencrypted Data Sent:* Rules out 'Keylogger'.
        - *Encrypted Traffic Detected:* Does not exclude any specific malware types.

6. **API Call Analysis**
    - Examines the usage of API calls to identify unusual or unauthorized activities.
    - **Outcomes:**
        - *Suspicious API Calls:* Rules out 'Keylogger'.
        - *Normal API Usage:* Does not exclude any specific malware types.
        - *API Hooking Detected:* Does not exclude any specific malware types.

## Using Detection Outcomes to Rule Out Malware

By applying these detection methods, you can systematically rule out certain malware types based on the specific outcomes observed. For example, if File System Monitoring shows ‘Files Created’, you can exclude the possibility of a Trojan Horse infection. If Binary Comparison detects 'Binary Differences Found', you can rule out a Trojan Horse as the malware type. Similarly, detecting 'Readable Code' in Static Code Analysis excludes the presence of a Trojan Horse.

This process helps narrow down the potential threats, allowing for a more targeted response to suspected malware infections. Understanding these rules and how to apply them will enhance your ability to diagnose and respond to malware incidents effectively, safeguarding your systems and data from cyber threats.
