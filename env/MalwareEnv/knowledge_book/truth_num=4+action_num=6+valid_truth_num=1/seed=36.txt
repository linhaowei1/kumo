# Malware Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to introduce some common types of malware and the detection methods used to analyze and rule them out. Understanding how to identify and rule out certain types of malware is crucial for strengthening cybersecurity defenses. We will explore four major types of malware and how various detection methods apply to each.

## Malware Types

### Bootkit
Bootkits are a type of malware that targets the boot sector of a computer. They aim to manipulate the boot process to gain control over the operating system. Due to their nature of attacking the boot sequence, they can be particularly difficult to detect and remove.

### Phishing Malware
This type of malware is delivered through deceptive emails and messages that appear to be from legitimate sources. Once recipients interact with these emails, such as clicking on links or downloading attachments, the malware is activated.

### Mobile Malware
Mobile malware targets mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, to steal data, track user actions, or damage the device. They are designed to exploit specific vulnerabilities in mobile operating systems.

### Polymorphic Virus
Polymorphic viruses are capable of altering their code with each infection, making them difficult to detect using traditional signature-based antivirus software. They can transform their structure while retaining the same core functions.

## Detection Methods and Rule-Out Approach

### 1. Registry Analysis
This method involves examining the Windows registry for changes that may indicate the presence of malware.

- **No Registry Changes Observed**: If there are no changes to the registry, particularly with startup entries or keys, **Mobile Malware** can be ruled out.

### 2. Email Header Analysis
This involves inspecting email headers for signs of malicious activity, often used to detect phishing attempts.

- **No Malicious Emails Detected**: If analysis reveals no signs of spoofing or suspicious activity, **Phishing Malware** can be ruled out.
- **Spoofed Sender Detected**: The detection of a spoofed sender allows **Phishing Malware** to be ruled out.

### 3. Binary Comparison
This method checks the binary differences between files, including size and content.

- **File Size Mismatch Found**: A discrepancy in file size allows **Polymorphic Virus** to be ruled out.

### 4. Time Stamp Analysis
This technique checks for inconsistencies in file timestamps that might suggest tampering.

- **Consistent Time Stamps**: Consistent timestamps allow **Polymorphic Virus** to be ruled out.
- **Time Stamps Mismatch Detected**: A mismatch in file timestamps allows **Bootkit** to be ruled out.

### 5. Entropy Analysis
Entropy analysis measures randomness in data which can indicate encryption or packing used by malware.

- **High Entropy (7.6 - 10.0)**: High entropy levels allow **Polymorphic Virus** to be ruled out.
- **Low Entropy (0.0 - 3.5) or Moderate Entropy (3.6 - 7.5)**: These entropy levels do not allow any specific malware types to be ruled out.

### 6. Driver Inspection
This involves analyzing system drivers for signs of tampering or unauthorized modification.

- **Unsigned Drivers Found**: The presence of unsigned drivers allows **Bootkit** to be ruled out.
- **Modified Drivers Found**: The presence of modified drivers allows **Bootkit** to be ruled out.
- **No Malicious Drivers**: This outcome does not allow any specific malware types to be ruled out.

By understanding and applying these detection methods, analysts can effectively rule out certain types of malware based on observed outcomes. This guide helps streamline the identification process, aiding in a more efficient response to potential threats.
