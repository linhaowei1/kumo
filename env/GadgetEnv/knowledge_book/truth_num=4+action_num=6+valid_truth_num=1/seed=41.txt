## Gadgets Overview

### 1. Steam-Powered Espresso Machine
This delightful contraption brings us the perfect blend of Victorian ingenuity and modern comfort, brewing rich espresso using steam power. While elegant and practical for a delicious cup of coffee, testing its hydraulic systems is crucial for safety and efficiency.

### 2. Mechanical Analytical Engine
The invention that transports you to the future of computation without electricity. This mechanical marvel is driven by precision-engineered gears and levers, and therefore, ensuring accurate gear alignment is crucial for its functionality.

### 3. Mechanical Babbage Typewriter
Combining mechanical function with literary finesse, this typewriter is inspired by the innovations of Charles Babbage. While it seems simple, its energy consumption and magnetic field attributes require careful monitoring to rule out inefficiencies.

### 4. Steam-Driven Pressurized Drill
This robust tool, powered entirely by steam, makes tackling hard surfaces a breeze. The hydraulic pressure it operates under must be rigorously tested to ensure effective drilling and to prevent mechanical failure.

## Experiments and Analysis

### 1. Analyze Gear Alignment
- **Alignment Within Spec**: All gadgets remain potentially viable; no exclusions based solely on this condition.
- **Misalignment Detected**: Excludes the Mechanical Analytical Engine since it relies heavily on precise gear alignment.
- **Critical Misalignment**: No gadgets are excluded based solely on this outcome.

### 2. Measure Energy Consumption
- **(0 - 100):** No gadgets are excluded; all are considered efficient within this range.
- **(100 - 500):** No exclusions; gadgets are still deemed efficient.
- **(500 - 1000):** Excludes the Mechanical Babbage Typewriter, as its consumption should ideally not reach this level.

### 3. Analyze Hydraulic Pressure
- **(0 - 50):** Excludes the Steam-Driven Pressurized Drill, as it must operate at higher pressures to be effective.
- **(50 - 100):** No exclusions; gadgets operate well within this pressure range.
- **(100 - 150):** Excludes the Steam-Powered Espresso Machine, signaling inefficient or potentially hazardous operation.

### 4. Analyze Magnetic Field Strength
- **(0 - 10):** All gadgets are deemed operable; no exclusions.
- **(10 - 50):** All gadgets still fall within an acceptable range.
- **(50 - 100):** Excludes the Mechanical Babbage Typewriter due to potential interference or inefficiency at higher magnetic field strengths.

### 5. Assess Pneumatic Flow
- **(0 - 30), (30 - 60), (60 - 100):** Across these ranges, no exclusion of gadgets is applicable; all function as expected.

### 6. Check Clockwork Timing
- **Timing Accurate**: All gadgets may still be considered functional; no exclusions are necessary.
- **Minor Delay**: No gadgets are excluded for minor timing anomalies.
- **Significant Delay**: No exclusions apply, although further investigation into individual gadgets might be warranted.
