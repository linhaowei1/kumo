# Hormonal Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an overview of selected hormones and related assays or tests designed to analyze hormonal functions. Each section includes a description of the hormones, the corresponding tests, and the interpretation of test outcomes through the lens of exclusion. This means we will understand which hormones can be ruled out or excluded based on specific test results.

## Hormones Overview

### 1. Thyroxine (T4)
Thyroxine, commonly known as T4, is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. It plays a crucial role in metabolism and energy regulation. Understanding T4 levels is vital for assessing thyroid function and diagnosing thyroid disorders such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.

### 2. Cortisol
Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It helps control blood sugar levels, regulate metabolism, and reduce inflammation. Cortisol levels fluctuate throughout the day and can be influenced by stress. Abnormal cortisol levels can indicate conditions like Cushing's syndrome or Addison's disease.

### 3. Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH)
ACTH is a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland. It stimulates the adrenal glands to release cortisol. Measuring ACTH levels helps assess adrenal and pituitary function and can be useful in diagnosing disorders related to these glands.

### 4. Vitamin D (Calcitriol)
Calcitriol, or active vitamin D, is essential for maintaining calcium balance and bone health. It helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus. Abnormal levels of vitamin D can lead to bone disorders such as rickets or osteomalacia.

## Hormone Assays / Endocrine Function Tests

### 1. Thyroid Function Test

This test assesses the levels of thyroid hormones, including Thyroxine (T4), to evaluate thyroid gland activity.

- **Normal**: When the Thyroid Function Test shows normal results, Thryoxine (T4) can be ruled out as a contributor to any present symptoms indicating thyroid dysfunction.
  
- **Hypothyroid**: If the test indicates a hypothyroid state, T4 is excluded from being the cause of hyperthyroid symptoms.

### 2. Calcium Level Test

This test measures the blood's calcium levels to understand bone and mineral metabolism.

- **Levels (0 to 8.5 mg/dL)**: If calcium is below 8.5 mg/dL, Vitamin D (Calcitriol) is ruled out as causing elevated calcium symptoms.
  
- **Levels (8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL and above 10.5 mg/dL)**: Within this range or above, no specific hormones are excluded.

### 3. Cortisol Level Test

This test measures the cortisol levels in the blood to assess adrenal function.

- **Levels (below 5 µg/dL)**: In cases where cortisol is below 5 µg/dL, Cortisol itself is ruled out as causing symptoms associated with high cortisol levels.
  
- **Levels (above 25 µg/dL)**: When cortisol levels exceed 25 µg/dL, Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) can be excluded from causing symptoms related to low cortisol.

### 4. Serum Vitamin D Level Test

This test determines the concentration of Vitamin D in the bloodstream.

- **Levels (0 to 20 ng/mL)**: Low Vitamin D levels rule out any symptoms indicative of high vitamin D presence.
  
- **Levels (20 to 50 and 50 to 1000 ng/mL)**: Within these ranges, no exclusions are directly related to vitamin D presence.

### 5. ACTH Level Test

This measurement assesses the levels of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) in the blood.

- **Levels (0 to 10 pg/mL)**: Low ACTH levels mean that ACTH is excluded as a cause of symptoms typically associated with high ACTH levels.
  
- **Levels (above 10 pg/mL)**: No specific exclusions when levels are high.

### 6. Overnight Dexamethasone Suppression Test

This test evaluates adrenal corticoid response to dexamethasone suppression.

- **Levels (below 5 µg/dL after suppression)**: If cortisol is adequately suppressed, Cortisol is ruled out as contributing to symptoms typical in non-suppression cases.
  
- **Levels (above 5 µg/dL after suppression)**: When suppression is inadequate, ACTH is ruled out as causing lower cortisol levels.

In summary, each test functions as a tool to rule out specific hormones depending on the outcomes, thus aiding in narrowing down potential hormonal issues. This guide is intended to assist clinicians and patients in better understanding hormone regulation and potential disorders.
