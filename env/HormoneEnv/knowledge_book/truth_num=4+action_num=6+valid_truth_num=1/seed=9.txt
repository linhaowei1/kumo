# Hormonal Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to provide clear insights into the relationships between certain hormones and the tests designed to evaluate them. Here, we focus on the hormones Growth Hormone (GH), Renin, Prolactin, and Androgens. We will explore various hormonal assays and endocrine function tests, explaining which hormones can be ruled out based on specific test outcomes.

## Hormones Overview

### Growth Hormone (GH)
Growth Hormone is a peptide hormone that stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and regeneration in humans. It plays a critical role in human development.

### Renin
Renin is an enzyme secreted by the kidneys that plays a crucial role in the body's blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance.

### Prolactin
Prolactin is a hormone primarily responsible for lactation (milk production) in mammals. It also has other functions related to growth, metabolism, and the immune system.

### Androgens
Androgens are a group of hormones that play a role in male traits and reproductive activity. They are present in both men and women.

## Hormone Assays / Endocrine Function Tests

### Growth Hormone Suppression Test
This test is used to assess the body's ability to suppress the levels of growth hormone:

- **Outcome 1:** If GH levels are between -1000 and 1, Growth Hormone (GH) is ruled out.
- **Outcome 2:** If GH levels are between 1 and 1000, no exclusion is applied.

### Prolactin Level Test
The Prolactin Level Test measures the amount of prolactin in the blood:

- **Outcome 1:** If prolactin levels are between 0 and 20, Prolactin is ruled out.
- **Outcome 2:** If levels exceed 20, no exclusion is applied.

### Free Androgen Index Test
This test evaluates the amount of active androgens in the body relative to a specific binding capacity:

- **Outcome 1:** If the index is between 0 and 10, Androgens are ruled out.
- **Outcome 2:** If the index is above 10, no exclusion is applied.

### Insulin Tolerance Test
The Insulin Tolerance Test assesses how well your hormone system responds to insulin, indicating GH levels:

- **Outcome 1:** If values are between 0 and 5, Growth Hormone (GH) is ruled out.
- **Outcome 2:** If values exceed 5, no exclusion is applied.

### Angiotensin II Level Test
This test measures the levels of angiotensin II, which is related to Renin activity:

- **Outcome 1:** If levels are between 0 and 20, no exclusion is applied.
- **Outcome 2:** Levels above 20 indicate Renin is ruled out.

### Erythropoietin Level Test
An Erythropoietin Level Test examines the production of erythropoietin, linked to Renin regulation:

- **Outcome 1:** If levels range from 0 to 9, no exclusion is applied.
- **Outcome 2:** Levels exceeding 9 suggest Renin is ruled out.

In summary, these tests each provide specific thresholds at which certain hormones can be excluded, aiding in the diagnosis and understanding of various endocrine conditions. Understanding these relationships helps in forming a comprehensive view of hormonal health and regulation.
