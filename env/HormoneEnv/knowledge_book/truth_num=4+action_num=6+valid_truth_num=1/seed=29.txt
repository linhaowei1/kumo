## **Hormonal Analysis Guidebook**

Welcome to the Hormonal Analysis Guidebook. This resource serves to explain the relationships between specific hormones and the assays or tests used to evaluate endocrine function. We will walk through each hormone and the associated tests, focusing on how they can be used to exclude certain hormonal imbalances or conditions.

## Hormones

### 1. Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1)
IGF-1 is a hormone similar in structure to insulin and plays an important role in childhood growth. It also continues to have anabolic effects in adults.

### 2. Thyroxine (T4)
Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. It is pivotal for regulating metabolism, growth, and development. 

### 3. Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)
This hormone is released by the parathyroid glands and is crucial in maintaining calcium and phosphate levels in the blood.

### 4. Erythropoietin (EPO)
EPO is produced primarily by the kidneys and its primary role is to stimulate the production of red blood cells in response to low oxygen levels in tissues.

## Hormone Assays / Endocrine Function Tests

### 1. Thyroid Function Test
This test evaluates thyroid function by measuring the levels of hormones produced by the thyroid gland to understand the metabolic state of a person. 

- **Normal**: Ruling out the involvement of Thyroxine (T4).
- **Hypothyroid**: Ruling out the involvement of Thyroxine (T4).

### 2. Growth Hormone Suppression Test
This test helps diagnose conditions related to excessive growth hormone production, like acromegaly.

- When hormone levels are in the range **(-1000, 1)**: There is no exclusion of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1).
- When hormone levels fall in the range **(1, 1000)**: Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) is excluded.

### 3. Erythropoietin Level Test
This test measures the amount of erythropoietin in the blood to evaluate whether the kidneys are working properly and the bones are producing adequate red blood cells.

- Level **(0, 9)**: Erythropoietin (EPO) is excluded.
- Level **(9, 1000)**: There is no exclusion of Erythropoietin (EPO).

### 4. Calcitonin Level Test
Primarily used to help diagnose overproduction or imbalances related to calcium, this test measures the hormone calcitonin, though it indirectly relates to parathyroid function.

- Level **(0, 10)**: No exclusion of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH).
- Level **(10, 1000)**: Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) is ruled out.

### 5. Parathyroid Hormone Level Test
Directly measures PTH in blood to diagnose hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism.

- Level **(0, 65)**: Ruling out Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) involvement.
- Level **(65, 1000)**: There is no exclusion of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH).

### 6. Calcium Level Test
Measures the amount of calcium in the blood and helps evaluate parathyroid function among other conditions.

- Calcium level **(0, 8.5)**: Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) is excluded.
- Calcium level **(8.5, 10.5)**: No exclusions based on calcium for PTH.
- Calcium level **(10.5, 1000)**: No exclusion of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH).

This guidebook emphasizes the interpretation of test outcomes to exclude hormonal involvement that could suggest abnormal hormonal functions. Understanding what is ruled out allows for more precise diagnosis and treatment planning.
