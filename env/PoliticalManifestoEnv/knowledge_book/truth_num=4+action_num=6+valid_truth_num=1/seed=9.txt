Below is an exploration of the political ideologies and the methodologies used for analysis.

## Summary of Methodologies and Ideologies Rule-Out

This guidebook supports the evaluation by ruling out certain political ideologies under specific outcomes when applying these methodologies. This exclusion approach helps analysts and policymakers understand which ideologies do not fit the observed results and reduces the complexity in identifying the most aligned or valid ideology.

In summary, methodological analysis is a crucial tool in understanding ideologies. While no method confirms ideological validity outright, elimination through evidence can provide greater clarity in political analysis.
