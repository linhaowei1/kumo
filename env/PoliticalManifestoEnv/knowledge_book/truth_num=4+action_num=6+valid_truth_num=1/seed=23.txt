# Political Analysis Guidebook

## Overview

This guidebook offers a structured approach to evaluating political ideologies using various analytical methodologies. By looking at historical, social, and policy-related contexts, we can rule out certain ideologies based on observed outcomes. Follow the instructions to understand how each methodology can help exclude specific ideologies from consideration. 

## Political Ideologies

### Futurism
An ideology characterized by a strong focus on technological innovation, modernism, and a departure from traditional values. Futurists often advocate for rapid societal and technological transformation.

### Conservatism
An ideology that emphasizes the importance of maintaining traditional institutions and practices. It tends to value stability, continuity, and a gradual approach to change rather than radical reforms.

### Patriarchy
A social system in which males hold primary power, playing predominant roles in political leadership, moral authority, and control of property. This ideology is often scrutinized in gender equality discourses.

### Militarism
An ideology that prioritizes military power and capability, often advocating for strong armed forces and their influence in government and society. Militarism supports the idea that military efficiency best serves the nation's needs and interests.
