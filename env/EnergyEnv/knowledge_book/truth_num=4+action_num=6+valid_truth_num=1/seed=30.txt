# Energy Source Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to provide a comprehensive overview of various energy sources and the diagnostic tests that can be used to analyze and rule out these sources based on specific outcome states. The primary goal is to help in identifying which energy sources are not applicable under particular diagnostic outcomes.

## Energy Sources

1. **Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES)**
   - This method stores energy by compressing air in an underground cavern or storage tank. When energy is needed, the compressed air is released, driving a turbine to generate electricity.

2. **Tidal Power**
   - Tidal power harnesses energy from the movement of water caused by tidal forces. This renewable energy source uses tidal currents and variations in sea levels to generate electricity.

3. **Geothermal Energy**
   - This energy is harnessed from heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. It can be used for electricity generation and direct heating applications.

4. **Flywheel Energy Storage**
   - Flywheel energy storage systems store kinetic energy in a rotating mass. These systems can quickly transfer stored energy back to the grid, offering rapid response energy reserves.

## Diagnostic Tests and Outcomes

### Ionizing Radiation Detection

- This test is essential for identifying the presence of radiation in an environment.
  - **High Radiation Levels:** No sources are ruled out.
  - **Low Radiation Levels:** 
    - Rule Out: Geothermal Energy
  - **No Radiation:** No sources are ruled out.

### Vibration Frequency Analysis

- This test evaluates the vibration patterns within a system to diagnose operational conditions.
  - **Frequency Range (0 - 10):** No sources are ruled out.
  - **Frequency Range (11 - 100):**
    - Rule Out: Flywheel Energy Storage, Compressed Air Energy Storage

### Fuel Consumption Analysis

- This analysis measures the fuel usage for energy conversion processes.
  - **High Fuel Consumption:** No sources are ruled out.
  - **No Fuel Consumption:**
    - Rule Out: Geothermal Energy

### Steam Quality Test

- This test assesses the purity of steam generated or used in an energy generation process.
  - **High Steam Purity:**
    - Rule Out: Geothermal Energy
  - **Low Steam Purity:** No sources are ruled out.
  - **No Steam Detected:** No sources are ruled out.

### Thermal Signature Analysis

- This test measures the heat emissions from an energy source.
  - **Thermal Range (0 - 50):**
    - Rule Out: Geothermal Energy
  - **Thermal Range (51 - 100):**
    - Rule Out: Flywheel Energy Storage, Compressed Air Energy Storage

### Carbon Footprint Assessment

- This assessment evaluates the environmental impact of energy production in terms of carbon emissions.
  - **Carbon Emission Range (0 - 50):**
    - Rule Out: Geothermal Energy
  - **Carbon Emission Range (51 - 100):** No sources are ruled out.

This guidebook is designed to provide clear and actionable insights into diagnosing and ruling out specific energy sources based on diagnostic test outcomes. By following the outlined tests and understanding their implications, analysts and engineers can make informed decisions to enhance energy system efficiency and operational integrity.
