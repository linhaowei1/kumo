# Energy Source Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to assist you in understanding and analyzing various energy sources using specific diagnostic tests. By understanding how to exclude certain energy sources based on test outcomes, you can efficiently narrow down potential energy solutions.

## Energy Sources

Let's begin by introducing the energy sources covered in this guide:

1. **Solar Power**: This refers to the energy harnessed from the sun's rays and converted into electricity through photovoltaic cells or solar thermal systems.

2. **Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES)**: This involves storing energy by compressing and storing air in large storage vessels or underground caverns, which is then released to generate electricity when needed.

3. **Onshore Wind Power**: This type of power is generated by wind turbines located on land, using wind to produce electricity.

4. **Pumped Hydro Storage**: An energy storage method that uses two water reservoirs at different elevations to generate power by moving water between them.

## Diagnostic Tests

Several diagnostic tests can be performed to help rule out specific energy sources based on their characteristics:

### 1. Fluid Dynamics Inspection

- **Objective**: To detect the movement of fluids within an energy system.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Fluid Movement Detected**: This outcome rules out the possibility of the energy source being 'Pumped Hydro Storage.'
  - **No Fluid Movement**: No energy sources are ruled out.

### 2. Vibration Frequency Analysis

- **Objective**: To assess the frequency of vibrations in the energy system, which can indicate the type of energy source.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Frequency Range (0 to 10 Hz)**: This suggests ruling out 'Solar Power' as a potential source.
  - **Frequency Range (11 to 100 Hz)**: This suggests ruling out 'Compressed Air Energy Storage.'

### 3. Voltage Output Stability Test

- **Objective**: To evaluate the stability of the voltage output from an energy source.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Voltage Stability (0 to 5)**: Rules out 'Solar Power.'
  - **Voltage Stability (6 to 100)**: No specific energy sources are ruled out.

### 4. Spectral Light Analysis

- **Objective**: To detect specific spectral lines that may indicate certain energy sources.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Presence of Specific Spectral Lines**: Rules out 'Solar Power.'
  - **No Specific Spectral Lines**: No energy sources are ruled out.

### 5. Thermal Signature Analysis

- **Objective**: To analyze the heat signature emitted by an energy system to differentiate between sources.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Heat Range (0 to 50)**: No energy sources are ruled out.
  - **Heat Range (51 to 100)**: Rules out both 'Compressed Air Energy Storage' and 'Solar Power.'

### 6. Chemical Residue Analysis

- **Objective**: To identify chemical residues that could indicate the type of energy used.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **High Carbon Residue**: No energy sources are ruled out.
  - **No Carbon Residue**: Rules out 'Solar Power.'

By applying these tests and outcomes, you can systematically exclude certain energy sources, which helps in determining the most likely energy system that fits within undetected parameters. Each test is designed to rule out specific sources, thereby simplifying the process of accurate identification in energy diagnostics.
