# Energy Source Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook introduces a variety of energy sources and the diagnostic tests that can help determine the most suitable energy source for specific applications. The guide is structured to rule out unsuitable energy options based on the outcomes of these diagnostic tests.

## Energy Sources

1. **Natural Gas Power**
   - A conventional energy source derived from natural gas, primarily used for electricity generation and as an alternative to coal.

2. **Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES)**
   - A technology that stores energy by compressing air and releasing it to generate electricity when needed. It offers flexibility in balancing supply and demand.

3. **Molten Salt Reactors**
   - An advanced nuclear technology utilizing molten salt to maintain reactor temperature. Known for its inherent safety features and potential for high efficiency.

4. **Fuel Cell Energy**
   - Utilizes hydrogen to produce electricity via a chemical reaction. It is known for its clean energy output with water as the only byproduct.

## Diagnostic Tests and Exclusionary Criteria

The following diagnostic tests are employed to validate or exclude energy sources based on observed outcomes. Each test outcome will rule out certain energy sources from consideration.

1. **Radiation Level Measurement**
   - **Purpose**: Assesses the radiation emissions from an energy source.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - With radiation levels between **0 and 0.05**: All energy sources remain potential candidates.
     - With radiation levels between **0.06 and 1**: **Molten Salt Reactors** are ruled out.

2. **Particulate Matter Analysis**
   - **Purpose**: Evaluates the presence of particulate emissions.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **High Particulate Emissions**: No specific energy sources are ruled out.
     - **Low Particulate Emissions**: **Natural Gas Power** is ruled out.
     - **No Particulate Emissions**: **Fuel Cell Energy** is ruled out.

3. **Vibration Frequency Analysis**
   - **Purpose**: Analyzes the level of vibration which may indicate specific operational characteristics.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - With vibration frequency between **0 and 10**: All energy sources remain potential candidates.
     - With vibration frequency between **11 and 100**: **Compressed Air Energy Storage** is ruled out.

4. **Carbon Footprint Assessment**
   - **Purpose**: Measures the environmental impact of the energy source in terms of carbon emissions.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - With a carbon footprint between **0 and 50**: **Fuel Cell Energy** is ruled out.
     - With a carbon footprint between **51 and 100**: **Natural Gas Power** is ruled out.

5. **Energy Density Calculation**
   - **Purpose**: Determines the amount of energy stored per unit volume.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - With energy density between **0 and 50**: All energy sources remain potential candidates.
     - With energy density between **51 and 100**: **Fuel Cell Energy** is ruled out.

6. **Surface Temperature Mapping**
   - **Purpose**: Assesses the surface temperatures of systems to indicate operational states.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - With surface temperature between **0 and 30**: All energy sources remain potential candidates.
     - With surface temperature between **31 and 100**: **Natural Gas Power** is ruled out.

By following these diagnostic tests and their specific rule-out criteria, stakeholders can accurately narrow down the viable energy sources for their needs, ensuring a more efficient and targeted approach to energy source selection. This guidebook serves as a decision-support tool, fostering a clearer understanding of how different energies stack up under diverse operational metrics.
