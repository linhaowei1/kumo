# Craftsman Tool Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Craftsman Tool Analysis Guidebook. This guide provides essential information on a selection of tools and a series of tests used to evaluate these tools based on specific criteria. Each test result helps rule out certain tools, thereby simplifying the process of selecting the appropriate tool for your needs.

## Tools Overview

1. **Allen Key**
   - A small handheld tool used to drive hexagonal socketed screws and bolts.

2. **Hammer**
   - A versatile tool used for driving nails, fitting parts, forging metal, and breaking objects.

3. **Jackhammer**
   - A powerful, pneumatic hammer used to break up rock, pavement, and concrete.

4. **Mallet**
   - A hammer with a large, typically square head, used for striking a surface without damaging it.

## Tests Description and Outcomes

### 1. Temperature Measurement

This test measures how tools react to different temperatures. The outcome shows which tools can be excluded based on temperature ranges they cannot endure.

- **0 to 100 Degrees:** No tools are excluded in this range.
- **100 to 300 Degrees:** No tools are excluded in this range.
- **300 to 600 Degrees:** The Jackhammer is ruled out as it cannot withstand this temperature range.

### 2. Impact Resistance Test

This test assesses a tool's ability to withstand impact without damage. Depending on the outcome, certain tools are excluded.

- **High Impact:** Mallet and Hammer are ruled out for applications requiring high impact resistance.
- **Low Impact:** No tools are excluded in this range.
- **Moderate Impact:** No tools are excluded in this range.

### 3. Torque Test

The Torque Test evaluates the amount of rotational force that can be applied to a tool before failure. Outcomes indicate which tools cannot handle specific torque levels.

- **0 to 5 Nm:** Allen Key is excluded, as it cannot withstand even minimal torque.
- **5 to 15 Nm:** No tools are excluded in this range.
- **15 to 30 Nm:** No tools are excluded in this range.

### 4. Tool Function Trial

This test assesses whether a tool can adequately perform its intended function. Tools failing this test cannot be used for those specific purposes.

- **Incapable of Fastening:** Allen Key is ruled out for fastening applications.
- **Incapable of Cutting:** No tools are ruled out in this category as no assessments were provided.
- **Passes Function Trial:** No tools are excluded, meaning the trial's passing does not provide exclusions.

### 5. Sharpness Test

Sharpness is critical for certain tools where cutting or precision is necessary. This test excludes tools that do not meet sharpness criteria.

- **0 to 3 Sharpness:** No tools are excluded in this sharpness range.
- **3 to 7 Sharpness:** No tools are excluded in this sharpness range.
- **7 to 10 Sharpness:** Mallet and Hammer are excluded, indicating these tools are not ideal when a high level of sharpness is required.

### 6. Durability Test

The Durability Test measures how well tools withstand prolonged use without significant wear or failure. Exclusion of tools is based on their durability outcome.

- **Low Durability:** No tools are excluded in this range.
- **High Durability:** Hammer is excluded when only tools with high durability are required.
- **Moderate Durability:** No tools are excluded in this range.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides a structured approach to eliminating tools from consideration based on specific test outcomes. By understanding how different tools react under various conditions, craftsmen can make more informed decisions for their projects. Always ensure you're considering the operational requirements of a tool for the specific task and environment it will be used in.
