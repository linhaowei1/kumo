# Craftsman Tool Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to help you understand and analyze various tools using a series of standardized tests. Through these tests, we aim to identify which tools may not be suitable for specific functions. For each test, certain outcomes will rule out the possibility of using particular tools, based on their performance characteristics.

## Introduction to Tools

1. **Grinder**
   - Used for polishing, cutting, and grinding materials such as metal and stone.
   
2. **Mallet**
   - A type of hammer with a large, usually wood or rubber, head used for driving chisels, shaping materials, or delivering soft blows.

3. **Hacksaw**
   - A fine-toothed saw used for cutting metal, plastic, and other materials.

4. **Cordless Nail Gun**
   - A battery-powered device used for driving nails into wood or other materials quickly and efficiently.

## Explanation of Tests and Outcomes

### Tool Function Trial
This test examines the basic operational capability of each tool.

- **Incapable of Fastening**: No tools are immediately ruled out.
- **Incapable of Cutting**: The Hacksaw is ruled out if it is incapable of cutting.
- **Passes Function Trial**: No tools are ruled out when they pass the function trial.

### Sharpness Test
This test assesses the sharpness of cutting tools on a scale from 0 to 10.

- **Sharpness (0-3)**: If the sharpness is between 0 and 3, the Hacksaw is ruled out.
- **Sharpness (3-7)**: No tools are ruled out.
- **Sharpness (7-10)**: This outcome rules out the Mallet, as it is not a tool evaluated based on sharpness.

### Battery Life Test
This test is applied to battery-operated tools to determine their operational longevity.

- **Battery Life (0-2)**: If the battery life is between 0 and 2, the Cordless Nail Gun is ruled out due to insufficient battery performance.
- **Battery Life (2-5)**: No tools are ruled out.
- **Battery Life (5-10)**: No tools are ruled out.

### Precision Test
This test measures the tool's ability to perform tasks with accuracy on a scale from 0 to 10.

- **Precision (0-3)**: If precision is between 0 and 3, the Mallet is ruled out. It is not a precision tool.
- **Precision (3-7)**: No tools are ruled out.
- **Precision (7-10)**: No tools are ruled out.

### Temperature Measurement
This test identifies the tool's exposure to heat during operation.

- **Temperature (0-100°C)**: No tools are ruled out.
- **Temperature (100-300°C)**: No tools are ruled out.
- **Temperature (300-600°C)**: The Grinder is ruled out if high temperatures are deemed unacceptable or pose an operational hazard.

### Impact Resistance Test
This test measures the durability of a tool against impact.

- **High Impact Resistance**: The Mallet is ruled out as the focus may be on tools with lesser toughness for fragility considerations.
- **Low Impact Resistance**: No tools are ruled out.
- **Moderate Impact Resistance**: No tools are ruled out.

By following this guidebook, you can efficiently determine which tools to exclude based on specific test outcomes. Always consider the test results carefully to ensure optimal performance and safety in your craftsman activities.
