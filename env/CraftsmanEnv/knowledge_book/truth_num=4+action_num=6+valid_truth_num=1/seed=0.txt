# Craftsman Tool Analysis Guide

This guide provides a detailed analysis of various craftsman tools and the tests used to evaluate their performance characteristics. By understanding these tools and their associated tests, we can effectively rule out tools that do not meet specific performance criteria.

## Tools Overview

1. **Staple Gun**: A handheld tool designed to drive staples into wood, plastic, or masonry. It is commonly used in upholstery work, carpentry, and various fastening tasks.

2. **Cordless Drill**: A portable, battery-powered drill. It is highly versatile, used for drilling holes and driving screws. Its convenience comes from not needing a power outlet, making it ideal for tasks in various locations.

3. **Drill**: A power tool used to create holes in various materials or fasten materials together with screws. Unlike its cordless counterpart, it typically requires a direct power source.

4. **Hammer**: A hand tool used to deliver sudden impacts to objects. Typically, it's used for driving nails, fitting parts, forging metal, and breaking up objects.

## Tests and Rule-Out Criteria

Each test provides specific insights into the abilities and limitations of the tools based on the outcomes observed.

### 1. Battery Life Test

This test measures how long a tool can operate on a full battery charge. Here’s what each range indicates:

- **(0, 2) Hours**: If a tool operates for only up to 2 hours, the **Cordless Drill** is ruled out.
- **(2, 5) Hours**: No tools are ruled out in this range.
- **(5, 10) Hours**: No tools are ruled out in this range.

### 2. Speed Test

This test determines how fast a tool can perform its primary function (e.g., rotations per minute for drills).

- **(0, 1000) RPM**: If the speed is within this range, the **Drill** is ruled out.
- **(1000, 3000) RPM**: No tools are ruled out in this range.
- **(3000, 5000) RPM**: No tools are ruled out in this range.

### 3. Cutting Ability Test

Assesses the tool's proficiency in cutting or penetrating materials.

- **Excellent**: No tools are ruled out.
- **Poor**: If the cutting ability is poor, the **Hammer** is ruled out.
- **Average**: No tools are ruled out.

### 4. Air Pressure Test

Evaluates the amount of air pressure a tool utilizes to function, primarily applicable to pneumatic tools.

- **(0, 50) PSI**: If this air pressure is observed, the **Staple Gun** is ruled out.
- **(50, 100) PSI**: No tools are ruled out in this range.

### 5. Bit Compatibility Test

Checks whether a tool is compatible with a range of bits/accessories.

- **Incompatible Bits**: If a tool shows incompatibility with certain bits, the **Drill** is ruled out.
- **Compatible Bits**: No tools are ruled out.

### 6. Flexibility Test

Measures how adaptively a tool can be utilized across different functions and environments.

- **Flexible**: No tools are ruled out.
- **Rigid**: If a tool appears rigid in functionality or use, the **Hammer** and **Drill** are ruled out.
- **Moderately Flexible**: No tools are ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guide outlined the tools’ functionality and tests used to determine their performance characteristics. When specific outcomes are noted during testing, we can concretely rule out certain tools that do not fit the performance criteria. These rule-out criteria help refine tool selection, ensuring you choose the most appropriate tool based on the desired performance characteristics.
