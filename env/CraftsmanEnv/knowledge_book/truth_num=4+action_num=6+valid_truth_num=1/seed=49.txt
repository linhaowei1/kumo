# Craftsman Tool Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Craftsman Tool Analysis Guidebook, where we will explore various tools and tests to determine the most suitable tools based on specific outcomes. This guidebook is designed to help you understand, evaluate, and make informed decisions about using and eliminating certain tools based on test results.

## Tools Overview

- **Tile Cutter**: Designed for cutting tiles to specific measurements, commonly used in tiling and renovation projects.
- **Cordless Nail Gun**: A portable tool used for driving nails into surfaces without the need for an external power source.
- **Hammer**: A hand tool typically used for driving nails, breaking objects, or shaping materials.
- **Clamp**: A fastening device used to hold objects securely together to prevent movement or separation.

## Test Explanations and Outcomes

Each tool is subjected to various tests to assess its performance in different criteria. The outcomes of these tests determine which tools should **not** be used when specific conditions are observed.

### Material Compatibility Test

This test evaluates whether a tool can be used on different materials such as wood, metal, or plastic.

- **Not compatible with Wood**: If this outcome is observed, the **Tile Cutter** should be ruled out, as it may not perform well on wooden surfaces.
- **Not compatible with Metal**: No tools are ruled out for incompatibility with metal.
- **Compatible with all materials**: Currently, no tools are ruled out.
- **Not compatible with Plastic**: No tools are ruled out for incompatibility with plastic.

### Battery Life Test

This test measures how long a tool with a battery can operate before needing recharging.

- **0 to 2 hours**: If a tool demonstrates a battery life of up to 2 hours, the **Cordless Nail Gun** should be ruled out due to its limited battery duration.
- **2 to 5 hours**: No tools are ruled out within this battery performance range.
- **5 to 10 hours**: No tools are ruled out within this battery performance range.

### Grip Strength Test

This test assesses how firmly a tool can be gripped, which is crucial for precision and safety during use.

- **0 to 5**: If grip strength measures between 0 and 5, the **Clamp** should be ruled out for potentially insufficient grip strength.
- **5 to 10**: No tools are ruled out in this grip strength range.

### Electrical Conductivity Test

This test checks if a tool conducts electricity, which is essential for ensuring safety during electrical work.

- **Conductive**: If a tool is conductive, the **Hammer** should be ruled out to avoid the risk of conducting electricity during use.
- **Non-Conductive**: No tools are ruled out as being non-conductive.
- **Insulated**: No tools are ruled out as being insulated.

### Cutting Ability Test

This test evaluates how well a tool can perform cutting actions.

- **Excellent**: No tools are ruled out with excellent cutting ability.
- **Poor**: If a tool is rated poor in cutting ability, the **Hammer** should be ruled out, as it is not ideal for cutting tasks.
- **Average**: No tools are ruled out with average cutting ability.

### Sharpness Test

This test gauges how sharp a tool is, affecting its cutting efficiency and precision.

- **0 to 3**: If a tool's sharpness ranges from 0 to 3, the **Tile Cutter** should be ruled out for adequate sharpness.
- **3 to 7**: No tools are ruled out within this sharpness range.
- **7 to 10**: If a tool's sharpness measures between 7 and 10, both the **Clamp** and **Hammer** should be ruled out for optimal tasks requiring high sharpness.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of how each tool interacts with various tests and the specific conditions under which they should be excluded. By following these recommendations, you will be better equipped to select appropriate tools, enhancing both safety and efficiency in your projects.
