# Craftsman Tool Analysis Guidebook

In this guidebook, we will explore the characteristics and testing processes for four commonly used tools: the Screwdriver, Grinder, Socket Wrench, and Allen Key. We will also detail the outcomes from various tests, focusing on which tools are ruled out based on the test results.

## Tools Overview

### 1. Screwdriver
The screwdriver is a handheld tool that is used for driving screws into materials. It typically consists of a handle and a metal shaft with a tip that fits into the screw head.

### 2. Grinder
A grinder is a power tool that uses an abrasive wheel to cut, grind, or polish materials. It is often used for tasks involving metal and offers high-speed functionality.

### 3. Socket Wrench
A socket wrench is a tool that allows users to turn fasteners, such as nuts and bolts. It typically includes a handle and a head featuring replaceable sockets.

### 4. Allen Key
An Allen key, also known as a hex key or hex wrench, is a simple tool used to drive screws and bolts with hexagonal sockets.

## Testing and Outcomes

The tools are evaluated using six different tests, with specific outcomes that rule out the involvement of certain tools. Below you will find the detailed analysis for each test.

### 1. Tool Function Trial
This test evaluates the basic functioning capability of the tools.

- **Incapable of Fastening**: If this outcome is observed, rule out the Screwdriver, Socket Wrench, and Allen Key as possible functioning tools. These tools are meant for fastening, and any inability signals an exclusion.

- **Incapable of Cutting**: There are no tools to exclude with this outcome since none of the tools are primarily cutting tools.

- **Passes Function Trial**: No tools are excluded, as passing the trial means all could be potential tools for the task.

### 2. Torque Test
This test measures the tools' ability to apply torque.

- Torque range (0, 5): If observed, rule out the Screwdriver and Allen Key. These tools do not meet the higher torque requirements indicated above this range.

- Torque range (5, 15): No tools are excluded within this torque range.

- Torque range (15, 30): Rule out the Socket Wrench because it is capable of higher torque than this range.

### 3. Vibration Test
This test assesses the vibration levels during tool operation.

- Vibration level (0, 3) and (3, 7): These levels do not result in any exclusions.

- Vibration level (7, 10): Rule out the Grinder, as it operates with significant vibration, which is usually greater in power tools like grinders.

### 4. Weight Measurement
This test determines the tools' weight for ease of handling.

- Weight range (0, 2): Rule out the Screwdriver and Allen Key as these are lightweight tools that fall within this weight range.

- Weight range (2, 5): No tools are excluded as they do not fit strictly in this range.

- Weight range (5, 20): Rule out the Grinder, as it is heavier and more robust than this range implies.

### 5. Magnetic Property Test
This evaluates if the tool has magnetic properties.

- **Magnetic**: Rule out the Screwdriver since it is identified as magnetic, while other tools might not possess this characteristic.

- **Non-Magnetic** and **No Magnetic Effect**: No tools are automatically excluded from these outcomes.

### 6. Speed Test
This examines the toolâ€™s operational speed.

- Speed range (0, 1000): Rule out the Grinder because it operates at higher speeds, generally above this minimal range.

- Speed range (1000, 3000) and (3000, 5000): No tools are excluded from these ranges.

## Conclusion
This guidebook outlines the specific exclusions associated with each test's outcomes. By understanding these relationships, users can effectively analyze which tools remain relevant for their specific needs and conditions.
