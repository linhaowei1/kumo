# Craftsman Tool Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a detailed analysis of various craftsman tools and tests that are used to evaluate their performance and suitability for specific tasks. Each tool is assessed through a series of tests, and the results help in ruling out certain tools depending on the observed outcomes.

## Tools Overview

1. **Tape Measure**: A versatile measuring tool commonly used in construction and crafting to measure dimensions with accuracy. Its lightweight and flexible design make it ideal for both small and large measuring tasks.

2. **Handsaw**: A manually operated tool used for cutting wood and other similar materials. Known for its straightforward design, the handsaw requires human effort to function and is a staple in many woodworking projects.

3. **Cordless Oscillating Tool**: A battery-powered tool featuring a variety of attachments for cutting, sanding, scraping, and polishing. It is renowned for its versatility and ease of use, especially in hard-to-reach areas.

4. **Grinder**: A powerful tool commonly used for cutting, grinding, or polishing material. It is often motor-driven and can handle tough materials, making it a crucial addition to any robust toolkit.

## Tests and Analysis

Each tool undergoes different tests to assess various attributes like battery life, noise levels, cutting ability, weight, functionality, and flexibility. Here's a detailed evaluation based on each test and their outcomes:

### 1. Battery Life Test

- **Test Overview**: Measures the duration for which a tool can operate on a full charge, applicable to battery-operated tools.
  
- **Outcomes**:
  - **0 to 2 Hours**: Exclude "Cordless Oscillating Tool"
  - **2 to 5 Hours**: No tools to exclude.
  - **5 to 10 Hours**: No tools to exclude.

### 2. Noise Level Test

- **Test Overview**: Evaluates the noise generated by a tool during operation, with lower decibels indicating quieter performance.
  
- **Outcomes**:
  - **0 to 30 dB**: No tools to exclude.
  - **30 to 70 dB**: No tools to exclude.
  - **70 to 120 dB**: Exclude "Grinder"

### 3. Cutting Ability Test

- **Test Overview**: Assesses how effectively a tool can cut materials, gauged at different performance levels.
  
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Excellent**: Exclude "Handsaw"
  - **Average**: No tools to exclude.
  - **Poor**: No tools to exclude.

### 4. Weight Measurement

- **Test Overview**: Determines the weight of each tool, useful for understanding portability and handling ease.
  
- **Outcomes**:
  - **0 to 2 kg**: Exclude "Tape Measure"
  - **2 to 5 kg**: No tools to exclude.
  - **5 to 20 kg**: Exclude "Grinder"

### 5. Tool Function Trial

- **Test Overview**: Evaluates the ability of a tool to perform its primary functions effectively.
  
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Incapable of Fastening**: No tools to exclude.
  - **Incapable of Cutting**: Exclude "Handsaw"
  - **Passes Function Trial**: No tools to exclude.

### 6. Flexibility Test

- **Test Overview**: Measures the ability of a tool to bend or be manipulated, significant for tools requiring flexibility.
  
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Flexible**: Exclude "Tape Measure"
  - **Moderately Flexible**: No tools to exclude.
  - **Rigid**: No tools to exclude.

## Conclusion

This guidebook aids in understanding how different tests exclude certain craftsman tools based on observed outcomes. By following this exclusion methodology, users can effectively narrow down their tool choices for specific tasks. Each rule is crafted to clarify which tools should not be considered given particular test results, guiding towards the optimal selection for crafting endeavors.
