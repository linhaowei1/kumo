## Craftsman Tool Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an analysis of a selection of craftsman tools and outlines the methods to test these tools' compatibility and functionality. Each tool is evaluated using specific tests, with the outcomes guiding users in determining which tools are unsuitable under certain conditions. This structured approach assists in identifying the most appropriate tool for a given task by effectively ruling out the incompatible ones.

## Tools Overview

### 1. Trowel
A trowel is a hand tool used for digging, applying, smoothing, or moving small amounts of viscous or particulate material.

### 2. Tape Measure
A tape measure is a flexible ruler used to measure size or distance, essential for tasks requiring accuracy in measurements.

### 3. Adjustable Wrench
An adjustable wrench is a versatile tool with a movable jaw, used to tighten or loosen nuts and bolts of varying sizes.

### 4. Saw
A saw is a tool with a blade or toothed edge, used to cut through materials such as wood.

## Tests and Outcomes

### Material Compatibility Test
This test evaluates which materials are not compatible with a specific tool. The following outcomes indicate tools that are not suitable for certain materials:
- **Not compatible with Wood**: Rule out the **Trowel**.
- **Not compatible with Metal**: Rule out the **Saw**.

### Electrical Conductivity Test
This test assesses the tool's ability to conduct electricity:
- **Conductive**: Rule out the **Saw** if conductivity is a concern.

### Torque Test
This test measures the torque capacity of a tool:
- **Range 15-30 Nm**: Rule out the **Adjustable Wrench** when torque measurements are within this range.

### Tool Function Trial
This test determines a tool's utility in performing specific functions:
- **Incapable of Fastening**: Rule out the **Adjustable Wrench**.
- **Incapable of Cutting**: Rule out the **Saw**.

### Surface Finish Test
This test focuses on the finish quality a tool delivers on surfaces:
- **Rough Finish**: Rule out the **Saw** if a smooth finish is required.

### Precision Test
This test evaluates the accuracy of a tool's performance in measurements or cuts:
- **Precision Level 7-10**: Rule out the **Tape Measure** for tasks needing precision beyond this range.

## Conclusion

This guidebook utilizes an elimination method to help users effectively determine unsuitable tools for specific tasks by evaluating them through various tests. By understanding and applying these rule-out criteria, craftsmen can ensure they select the right tool for each unique job, optimizing performance and outcomes.
