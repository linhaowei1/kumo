# Craftsman Tool Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook serves as a comprehensive analysis to help determine the applicability and suitability of several essential craftsmen tools. The guide covers four primary tools and six crucial tests that can reveal insights into each tool's performance and usability characteristics. Understanding the results of these tests will aid in deducing which tools are appropriate or inappropriate for specific tasks and users.

## Tools Overview

### 1. Spanner
A spanner, also known as a wrench, is used to provide grip and mechanical advantage in applying torque to turn objects—usually rotary fasteners, such as nuts and bolts.

### 2. Miter Saw
A miter saw is a specialized tool that lets you make cuts at a variety of angles. The saw has a blade mounted on a swing arm that pivots left or right to produce angled cuts.

### 3. Plane
A plane is a tool for shaping wood, employing a sharpened blade to shave off the wood fibers, resulting in a smooth surface.

### 4. Grinder
A grinder is a tool that cuts, grinds, or polishes materials by means of a rotating abrasive wheel.

## Tests Overview and Exclusion Criteria

### 1. Tool Function Trial
This test assesses whether the tool performs its primary function effectively.

- **Incapable of Fastening**: If a tool fails to securely fasten or turn a fastener, it is ruled out as a spanner.
- **Incapable of Cutting**: If a tool cannot successfully cut through wood or other materials, it should be excluded as a plane.

### 2. Ergonomic Check
This test evaluates the ease of use and comfort of handling the tool.

- **Poor Ergonomics**: If a tool proves uncomfortable or awkward to handle, it is not suitable as a grinder.
- **Requires Two Hands**: If a tool necessitates the use of both hands for operation, it should be ruled out as a Miter Saw, as single-handed use is preferable.

### 3. Torque Test
The torque test measures how much turning force a tool can apply.

- Tools that provide a torque level between *(15, 30) Nm* are excluded as spanners, as they exceed the expected torque for this category.

### 4. Temperature Measurement
This measures the heat generated by the tool during operation, ensuring it doesn’t reach unsafe levels.

- Tools that generate temperatures between *(300, 600)°C* are ruled out as grinders, due to excessive heat production that surpasses normal operating conditions.

### 5. Vibration Test
This test determines the amount of vibration produced by a tool, as excessive vibration can lead to discomfort or injuries over prolonged use.

- Tools that produce vibration levels between *(7, 10) m/s²* are excluded from being grinders, indicating high vibrations.

### 6. Noise Level Test
Here we measure the sound output of a tool during operation.

- Tools that emit noise levels between *(70, 120) dB* are to be excluded as grinders, since they exceed acceptable noise levels potentially harmful to hearing.

## Conclusion

By carefully following this guide, each test provides a clear directive on which tools should be excluded given specific outcomes. This method ensures that only suitable tools are used for their intended functions, maximizing efficiency, safety, and user comfort. This approach not only makes the selection process easier but also improves the overall quality of craftsmanship.
