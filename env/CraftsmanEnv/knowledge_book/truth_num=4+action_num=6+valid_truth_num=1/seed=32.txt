# Craftsman Tool Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is intended to provide insights into various tools and tests commonly used in craftsmanship. It identifies specific test outcomes and highlights the tools that are not suitable when certain conditions are met. Understanding these relationships will help you make informed decisions when selecting tools for specific tasks.

## Tools Overview

1. **Tile Cutter**: A tool designed for cutting ceramic, glass, and other types of tile with precision. 

2. **Heat Gun**: A versatile tool that emits a stream of hot air and is commonly used for tasks like paint stripping, plastic welding, and shrink-wrapping.

3. **Wood Glue**: An adhesive specifically formulated for bonding pieces of wood together. It is known for creating strong bonds when used correctly.

4. **Multimeter**: A diagnostic tool used to measure electrical properties such as voltage, current, and resistance.

## Test Descriptions

1. **Material Compatibility Test**: This test determines if a tool is suitable for use with various materials, such as wood, metal, and plastic.

2. **Moisture Resistance Test**: This test assesses the ability of a material or tool to resist moisture penetration or damage.

3. **Heat Resistance Test**: This test evaluates how well a tool or material can withstand exposure to heat over specific temperature ranges.

4. **Calibration Check**: This test ensures that instruments are providing accurate readings by checking if calibration is required.

5. **Electrical Conductivity Test**: This test checks if a material allows the flow of electrical current, indicating whether it is conductive or non-conductive.

6. **Precision Test**: This test measures the accuracy and precision of a tool in performing its intended function.
