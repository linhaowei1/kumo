# Craftsman Tool Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook is designed to provide clear instructions on analyzing various craftsman tools using specific tests. The aim is to rule out incompatible tools based on the observed outcomes of the tests. The tools analyzed are the Adjustable Wrench, Caulk Gun, Pliers, and Cordless Oscillating Tool. The tests conducted include the Flexibility Test, Torque Test, Flow Rate Test, Chemical Resistance Test, Grip Strength Test, and Weight Measurement.

## Tools Overview

1. **Adjustable Wrench**
   - A versatile tool used for gripping and turning fasteners of various sizes. It is designed with a movable jaw that allows adjustment to fit different nuts and bolts.

2. **Caulk Gun**
   - Used to apply caulk or sealants precisely. Essential for sealing gaps and cracks in construction or home repair projects. 

3. **Pliers**
   - Multi-functional hand tools commonly used for gripping, bending, and cutting wire or metal. 

4. **Cordless Oscillating Tool**
   - A powered tool that facilitates cutting, sanding, and grinding with suitable attachments. Useful for a range of repairs and installations.

## Test Explanations and Rule-Out Criteria

### 1. Flexibility Test
Assesses the ability of a tool to bend or flex without breaking. 
- **Rigid**: The tool resists bending or flexing.
  - **Rule-Out**: If a tool is observed to be rigid, eliminate Pliers from consideration.

### 2. Torque Test
Evaluates the tool's capability to apply rotational force.
- **Torque Ranges**:
  - **0 to 5**: Indicates low torque capacity.
    - **Rule-Out**: Eliminate Pliers when this outcome occurs.
  - **15 to 30**: Indicates a higher torque handling capacity.
    - **Rule-Out**: Eliminate Adjustable Wrench when this outcome occurs.

### 3. Flow Rate Test
Measures the flow rate of materials dispensed by a tool, applicable to tools like the Caulk Gun.
- **Flow Rate Ranges**:
  - **0 to 5**: Indicates minimal flow rate.
    - **Rule-Out**: If observed in this range, eliminate Caulk Gun.

### 4. Chemical Resistance Test
Examines the tool's ability to resist corrosion or degradation upon exposure to chemicals.
- **Chemical Resistant**: Perfectly withstands chemical exposure.
  - **Rule-Out**: When chemical resistance is observed, eliminate Pliers.

### 5. Grip Strength Test
Assesses the force required to hold an object securely with the tool.
- **Grip Strength Ranges**:
  - **0 to 5**: Signifies weak grip strength.
    - **Rule-Out**: If within this range, eliminate Pliers.

### 6. Weight Measurement
Calculates the total weight of a tool, determining its portability and ease of use.
- **Weight Ranges**:
  - **0 to 2**: Considers lightweight.
    - **Rule-Out**: Eliminate Pliers if observed in this weight category.

## Conclusion
This guidebook provides a systematic method to analyze specific craftsman tools to eliminate those not suitable for a particular task or requirement. By following the defined rule-out criteria for each test, one can efficiently narrow down the selection to determine the most appropriate tool for their needs.
