# Craftsman Tool Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to introduce you to a selection of essential tools and provide a comprehensive analysis of their functionalities through a series of standardized tests. By understanding the outcomes of each test, you will better grasp the suitability of these tools for specific applications. This guidebook focuses on the following tools and tests:

## Tools Overview
1. **Vise**: A vise is a mechanical device used to secure an object to allow work to be performed on it. It has two parallel jaws, one fixed and the other movable, threaded in and out by a screw and lever. Visually, it resembles a large clamp.

2. **Hammer**: A hammer is a hand tool that delivers a blow to an object. It generally consists of a handle and a head, and is used for driving nails, fitting parts, forging metal, and breaking objects.

3. **Square**: A square is a tool used in construction and woodworking. It consists of two straightedges fixed at a right angle to each other and is used for checking trueness of surfaces and angles.

4. **Lathe**: A lathe is a machine that shapes wood, metal, and other material by rotating the workpiece around a stationary cutting tool.

## Test Explanations and Rule-Out Guide

### Ergonomic Check
An ergonomic check evaluates whether a tool is comfortable and efficient to use over extended periods. Observations from this check help determine user fatigue and ease of use.

- **Poor Ergonomics**: No tools are explicitly ruled out by this outcome.
- **Excellent Ergonomics**: No tools are directly excluded by this result.
- **Requires Two Hands**: If the tool requires two hands to operate efficiently, the **Lathe** is excluded.

### Moisture Resistance Test
The moisture resistance test assesses a toolâ€™s ability to resist degradation or malfunction when exposed to moisture.

- **Resistant**
  - When observing a tool's resistance to moisture, the **Hammer** is excluded.
- **Not Resistant**: No tools are to be ruled out by this determination.
- **Moderately Resistant**: No tools are excluded under moderate resistance.

### Grip Strength Test
This test measures the force required to hold and maneuver a tool securely, crucial for user control and safety.

- **Grip Strength (0 to 5)**
  - Tools with a grip strength rating within this range lead to the exclusion of the **Vise**.
- **Grip Strength (5 to 10)**: No tools are eliminated with this measure.

### Weight Measurement
Understanding the weight of a tool can influence its portability and ease of use for different tasks.

- **Weight (0 to 2)**: No tools are ruled out by observing this weight category.
- **Weight (2 to 5)**: There are no exclusions associated with this weight range.
- **Weight (5 to 20)**
  - Weights in this bracket lead to the exclusion of the **Lathe**.

### Impact Resistance Test
Impact resistance measures a tool's ability to withstand physical force or shock without damage.

- **High Impact Resistance**
  - With a high impact resistance rating, the **Hammer** is ruled out.
- **Low Impact Resistance**: If a tool is rated low, no tools are considered excluded.
- **Moderate Impact Resistance**: No tools are excluded with a moderate rating.

### Cutting Ability Test
This test evaluates a tool's capability to cut through or shape material effectively.

- **Excellent Cutting Ability**: When a tool displays excellent cutting ability, no tools are ruled out.
- **Poor Cutting Ability**
  - Tools with poor cutting ability lead to the exclusion of the **Hammer**.
- **Average Cutting Ability**: No tools are ruled out under average cutting performance.

By adhering to these guidelines, the analysis provided by each test will help clearly determine which tools are unsuitable for particular tasks, ensuring ideal tool selection for craftsmen and users alike.
