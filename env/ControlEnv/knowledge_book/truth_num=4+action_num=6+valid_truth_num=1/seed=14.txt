# Guidebook for Control Algorithm Analysis

Understanding the various control algorithms and their performance in specific test scenarios is crucial for selecting the appropriate control strategy for a given application. This guidebook provides an introduction to some key control algorithms and presents a framework for motor behavior analysis through specific feedback loop testing. Each test scenario is accompanied by outcomes that help rule out certain control algorithms based on observed characteristics.

## Control Algorithms Overview

1. **Model Predictive Control (MPC):**
   - Model Predictive Control is a type of control strategy that uses a model to predict future outcomes and optimize control actions over a specified horizon. It's well-suited for complex systems with constraints.
   
2. **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR):**
   - LQR is an optimal control strategy used to minimize a quadratic cost function. It is widely applied in systems where balancing performance and control effort is key.
   
3. **Kalman Filter Control:**
   - Conducts state estimation using past measurements and predictions. It is efficient for systems with noise and is used for tracking and control tasks.
   
4. **Feedforward Control:**
   - This control method acts preemptively based on measured disturbances to improve tracking performance, often complementing feedback control.

## Motor Behavior Analysis / Feedback Loop Testing

### 1. Zero Dynamics Analysis

### 3. Rise Time Measurement
- **Purpose:** Measure the time taken for a system’s response to rise from a lower percentage to a higher percentage of its final value following a step input.
- **Outcomes by Time Interval:**
  - **(0, 0.5) seconds:** No algorithms are ruled out.
  - **(0.5, 1.5) seconds:** No algorithms are ruled out.
  - **(1.5, 5) seconds:** Rule out Model Predictive Control and Feedforward Control.

### 4. Load Disturbance Test
- **Purpose:** Identify how the system reacts to changes in load and its ability to maintain steady operation.
- **Outcomes:**
  - **High Sensitivity:** Rule out Feedforward Control.
  - **Low Sensitivity:** No algorithms are ruled out.
  - **Medium Sensitivity:** No algorithms are ruled out.

### 5. Noise Sensitivity Analysis
- **Purpose:** Determine how responsive a system is to noise in signal inputs.
- **Outcomes:**

  - **Low Sensitivity to Noise:** Rule out Model Predictive Control.

### 6. Sine Wave Tracking Test
- **Purpose:** Evaluate the system's ability to track a sinusoidal input without lag.
- **Outcomes by Amplitude Range:**
  - **(0, 0.1):** No algorithms are ruled out.
  - **(0.1, 0.5):** No algorithms are ruled out.
  - **(0.5, 1):** Rule out Model Predictive Control and Feedforward Control.

## Conclusion

This guidebook outlines how various testing scenarios can be used to determine appropriate control strategies by excluding unsuitable algorithms based on observed outcomes. Careful application of these tests can significantly aid in fine-tuning control systems for optimal performance across diverse operational conditions. Keep in mind that while certain algorithms may be ruled out due to specific test results, further analysis may be required to select the most fitting control strategy for complex systems.
