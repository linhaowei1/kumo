## Guidebook for Control Algorithm Analysis

This guidebook aims to provide a clear understanding of several control algorithms and how to analyze and test them using various motor behavior analyses and feedback loop testing techniques. The goal is to help you decide which control algorithms may not be appropriate based on specific outcomes observed during these tests.

### Control Algorithms

1. **Bang-Bang Control**: 
   - A simple on-off control algorithm that switches between two states, often used when precision is not critical. It is fast but might lead to overshooting and instability.

2. **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**:
   - A type of optimal control that uses a quadratic cost function to derive a feedback law, providing smooth control with consideration for both error and control effort.

3. **H-infinity Control**:
   - A robust control method designed to handle model uncertainties and disturbances, useful in environments with noise and where stability is a major concern.

4. **Feedforward Control**:
   - A control strategy that anticipates changes by applying a predicted correction based on a model of the system, often used alongside feedback control to improve performance.

### Motor Behavior Analysis / Feedback Loop Testing

These analyses and tests are used to evaluate control algorithms by observing specific behaviors and characteristics.

1. **Tracking Error Analysis**:
   - Measures how accurately the output tracks a desired input over time. After performing this analysis, observe the range of tracking error:
     - **(0, 0.01)** and **(0.01, 0.1)**: No algorithms are ruled out.
     - **(0.1, 1)**: Rule out Feedforward Control.

2. **Hysteresis Test**:
   - Assesses whether the output lags behind changes in input, also known as memory effect.
     - **Hysteresis Observed**: Rule out Bang-Bang Control.
     - **No Hysteresis**: No algorithms are ruled out.

3. **Delay Tolerance Test**:
   - Evaluates how well a control algorithm performs when there is a delay in the control loop.
     - **Delay Sensitive**: Rule out Bang-Bang Control.
     - **Delay Tolerant**: Rule out H-infinity Control.

4. **Settling Time Measurement**:
   - Measures the time taken for the system to settle within a certain error band of the desired value.
     - **(0, 1)** and **(1, 3)**: No algorithms are ruled out.
     - **(3, 10)**: Rule out Bang-Bang Control, Feedforward Control.

5. **Overshoot Measurement**:
   - Indicates how much the output exceeds the desired value before settling down.
     - **(0, 5)**: Rule out Bang-Bang Control.
     - **(5, 20)**: No algorithms are ruled out.
     - **(20, 100)**: Rule out H-infinity Control.

6. **Noise Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Tests the system's response to random disturbances or "noise".
     - **High Sensitivity to Noise**: Rule out H-infinity Control.
     - **Low Sensitivity to Noise**: Rule out Bang-Bang Control.

### Conclusion

By conducting these tests and observing specific outcomes, you can effectively rule out control algorithms that are not suited for your application. This analysis helps in narrowing down the choices by eliminating possibilities rather than confirming options, ensuring a more focused approach in control system design and implementation.
