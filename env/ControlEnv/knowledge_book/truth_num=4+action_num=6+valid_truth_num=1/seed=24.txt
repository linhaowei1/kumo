# Guidebook for Control Algorithm Analysis

This guide is designed to help you analyze and understand the performance of various control algorithms through motor behavior analysis and feedback loop testing. We will cover the following control algorithms: **Kalman Filter Control, Integral Control, Sliding Mode Control, and Extended Kalman Filter Control**. We'll also discuss how to use feedback loop tests to identify which algorithms to rule out based on specific outcomes. Letâ€™s dive in!

## Control Algorithms

1. **Kalman Filter Control**: This algorithm is optimal for systems with noise and uncertainties. It's widely used in control systems for its ability to provide accurate estimates of the internal state of a process. However, it can suffer under poor observability and high sensitivity to noise.
   
2. **Integral Control**: Integral control addresses accumulated errors. It's effective for reducing steady-state errors and improving system accuracy over time. However, it might not perform well with fast convergence speed requirements or handle saturation appropriately.
   
3. **Sliding Mode Control**: Known for its robustness, Sliding Mode Control excels in systems with model uncertainties and disturbances. It's less sensitive to noise but can experience issues in systems that require fast rise times or very low steady-state errors.
   
4. **Extended Kalman Filter Control**: An extension of the Kalman Filter, this algorithm is tailored for non-linear systems. Like its counterpart, it can struggle under poor observability and with high noise levels.

## Feedback Loop Testing

To identify which control algorithms to rule out, the following testing procedures are applied:

1. **Rise Time Measurement**: This test evaluates the time taken for a system to reach a desired state:
   - **Rule-Outs**:
     - If observed rise time is between 0 and 0.5 seconds, rule out **Integral Control**.
     - If observed rise time is between 1.5 and 5 seconds, rule out **Sliding Mode Control**.

2. **Observer Performance Test**: This test determines how well the system's current state can be observed:
   - **Rule-Outs**:
     - Under **Poor Observability** conditions, rule out **Kalman Filter Control** and **Extended Kalman Filter Control**.

3. **Convergence Speed Test**: Assesses how quickly a system stabilizes to its set-point:
   - **Rule-Outs**:
     - For convergence speeds between 0 and 1, rule out **Integral Control**.

4. **Steady-State Error Measurement**: Measures the variance between the desired and actual output:
   - **Rule-Outs**:
     - For errors between 0 and 0.01, rule out **Integral Control**.
     - For errors between 0.05 and 1, rule out **Sliding Mode Control**.

5. **Noise Sensitivity Analysis**: Evaluates the system's performance in the presence of noise:
   - **Rule-Outs**:
     - Under **High Sensitivity to Noise**, rule out **Kalman Filter Control** and **Extended Kalman Filter Control**.
     - Under **Low Sensitivity to Noise**, rule out **Sliding Mode Control**.

6. **Saturation Handling Test**: Tests the ability of the controller to manage limits without performance loss:
   - **Rule-Outs**:
     - Under **Poor Saturation Handling**, rule out **Integral Control**.

By performing these tests and applying the rule-out criterion, you'll be able to systematically eliminate unsuitable control algorithms, enhancing your system analysis and optimization processes. Remember, the process aims to eliminate options, focusing your efforts on finding the most suitable control strategy for your specific application needs.
