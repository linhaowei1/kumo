# Guide to Control Algorithm Analysis

In the realm of automation and dynamic systems, selecting the appropriate control algorithm is crucial for system stability and performance. This guide provides an introductory overview of four key control algorithms and outlines six common tests used for motor behavior analysis and feedback loop testing. For each test, specific outcomes help in ruling out certain control algorithms, creating a systematic approach to algorithm selection.

## Control Algorithms Overview

### 1. Optimal Control
Optimal Control focuses on finding a control law that minimizes a given performance criterion. It generally involves solving a set of equations that govern the dynamic behavior of the system, aiming to find the best possible control action over a certain time horizon.

### 2. Robust Control
Robust Control prioritizes system stability and performance despite the presence of uncertainties or variations in system parameters. It ensures that the system can withstand a range of disturbances and maintain functionality without precise knowledge of the system model.

### 3. Deadbeat Control
Deadbeat Control is a type of discrete-time control system that aims to bring the system state to zero in the minimum number of time steps. It is known for its fast response characteristics, often reaching the desired state in a predictable number of iterations.

### 4. Model Predictive Control (MPC)
Model Predictive Control leverages a model of the system to predict future behavior and optimize control actions accordingly. MPC is particularly advantageous for systems with constraints, utilizing optimization techniques to provide efficient control solutions over a prediction horizon.

## Motor Behavior Analysis / Feedback Loop Testing

### 1. Zero Dynamics Analysis
This test assesses the internal stability of a system by evaluating its zero dynamics. Observations include:

- **Non-minimum Phase:** If non-minimum phase behavior is observed, **Model Predictive Control** should be ruled out.

- **Minimum Phase:** No algorithms need to be excluded based on this observation.

### 2. Control Effort Analysis
This analysis measures the amount of effort required by a control system to achieve desired performance:

- **Control Effort (0, 10):** If low control effort is observed, both **Optimal Control** and **Robust Control** should be ruled out.
  
- **Control Effort (10, 50):** No algorithms are excluded under moderate control effort.

- **Control Effort (50, 100):** If high control effort is observed, **Deadbeat Control** should not be selected.

### 3. Delay Tolerance Test
This test examines how well a control algorithm can handle delays in the system:

- **Delay Sensitive:** If sensitivity to delays is detected, **Deadbeat Control** should be ruled out.
  
- **Delay Tolerant:** If tolerance to delays is observed, **Robust Control** should not be used.

### 4. Bode Plot Analysis
Bode plot analysis provides insights into the frequency response characteristics of a system:

- **Phase Lag Increase:** No specific algorithms are ruled out.
  
- **Phase Lead Increase:** No specific algorithms are ruled out.

- **Gain Margin Reduction:** If a reduction in gain margin is detected, **Robust Control** should be ruled out.

### 5. Overshoot Measurement
This test measures the amount by which a system exceeds its target setpoint:

- **Overshoot (0, 5):** If minimal overshoot is observed, **Deadbeat Control** should not be selected.
  
- **Overshoot (5, 20):** No exclusions are made for moderate overshoot.

- **Overshoot (20, 100):** If high overshoot is present, both **Optimal Control** and **Robust Control** should be ruled out.

### 6. Saturation Handling Test
Saturation handling evaluates how well a control algorithm can manage actuator saturation:

- **Poor Saturation Handling:** No specific algorithms are ruled out.
  
- **Good Saturation Handling:** If good handling of saturation is required, **Model Predictive Control** should not be selected.

Through these tests, clear observations can rule out unsuitable control algorithms, paving the way for an informed selection of the most suitable control strategy for the specific system requirements.
