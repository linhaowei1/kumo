# Guidebook for Control Algorithm Analysis

## Introduction
This guidebook is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of various control algorithms and motor behavior analysis tests. Our focus is on Model Predictive Control, Bang-Bang Control, Derivative Control, and LQG. We also explore the outcomes of different testing scenarios to determine which control algorithms can be ruled out based on specific observations.

## Control Algorithms Overview

1. **Model Predictive Control (MPC):**
   MPC is a sophisticated control algorithm used for solving optimization problems over a finite horizon. It’s highly effective in managing constraints and forecasted disturbances by continuously updating the control actions based on a model of the system.

2. **Bang-Bang Control:**
   This control method is characterized by its simplicity and rapid changes between two states, usually 'on' and 'off.' It is applied in systems requiring quick and full response adjustment, such as temperature and position control systems.

3. **Derivative Control:**
   Derivative control primarily focuses on predicting future system behavior through rate-of-change observations. Although it's not standalone, it's used as a part of PID controllers to stabilize control processes and reduce overshoot.

4. **Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG):**
   LQG is a control strategy that combines a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) with a Kalman filter. It’s preferred in uncertain dynamic systems due to its optimal feedback ability, minimizing the expected value of a cost function.

## Motor Behavior Analysis & Feedback Loop Testing

Understanding and analyzing the behavior of motors under various controls is crucial for determining system performance and stability. Below are critical tests performed to assess the behavior and suitability of control algorithms:

1. **Frequency Response Test:**
   This test analyzes how a system responds over a range of frequencies. Observed outcomes can guide algorithm selection:
   - If a low phase margin is observed, exclude LQG as a viable control algorithm.

2. **Steady-State Error Measurement:**
   This evaluates how accurately a control system reaches and maintains a desired state:
   - Exclude Model Predictive Control if the steady-state error falls between 0.05 and 1.

3. **Stability Under External Perturbations:**
   This test checks the resilience of a system when subjected to external disturbances:
   - Exclude Derivative Control when instability is observed.

4. **Settling Time Measurement:**
   Settling time measures how quickly a system stabilizes after a disturbance:
   - Exclude both Bang-Bang Control and Model Predictive Control if the settling time is observed between 3 and 10 seconds.

5. **Zero Dynamics Analysis:**
   This analysis determines the internal system dynamics when inputs are zero:
   - Exclude Model Predictive Control if non-minimum phase behavior is noticed.

6. **Saturation Handling Test:**
   This test evaluates a system's ability to handle input saturation without adverse effects:
   - **Good Saturation Handling:** Exclude Model Predictive Control.
   
## Conclusion
This guide provides a structured analysis path for various control algorithms through specific testing scenarios. By understanding and identifying the outcomes that exclude certain algorithms, system designers can make informed choices about which control strategy is suitable for their particular needs. Always remember that fitting the right control algorithm can significantly enhance system efficiency, stability, and performance.
