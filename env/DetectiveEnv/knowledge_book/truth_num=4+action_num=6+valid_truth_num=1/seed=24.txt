# Detective Guidebook: Prime Suspect Identification Process

## Introduction

As an investigator, your primary objective is to narrow down the pool of suspects based on evidence gathered through various investigation actions. This guidebook will help you navigate the process of identifying the prime suspect for your case. Here, we will explain the suspects, investigation actions, and summarize findings that will guide you in ruling out individuals who cannot be the perpetrator.

## Suspects

The following individuals are under investigation:

1. **Magistrate Cream**: An esteemed figure with an official capacity, known for their strict observation of the law.
2. **Agent Coral**: A highly trained and experienced law enforcement agent, well-versed in undercover operations.
3. **Master Garnet**: A reputed master of design and art, known for their eccentric style and innovative approaches.
4. **Mr. Gold**: An unknown but mysteriously affluent individual with a past shrouded in secrecy.

## Investigation Actions

Our investigation involves several critical actions aimed at collecting and analyzing evidence. Each action can lead to outcomes that exclude certain suspects from being involved:

1. **DNA Analysis**: Examines genetic material to determine involvement:
   - **Exclusion**: Mr. Gold cannot be the perpetrator based on genetic evidence.
   - **Inconclusive and Partial Match**: Do not rule out any suspect. 

2. **Email Correspondence Analysis**: Reviews digital communications between suspects and the victim:
   - **No Contact with Victim**: Master Garnet is ruled out as there is no email contact evidence with the victim.
   - **Suspicious Emails Found**: No suspects are excluded at this time.

3. **Handwriting Comparison**: Compares handwriting on discovered documents:
   - **Mismatch**: Magistrate Cream is ruled out due to non-matching handwriting.
   - **Possible Match and Inconclusive**: No suspects are excluded.

4. **Psychological Profiling**: Matches suspect behavior with the perpetrator's likely psychological profile:
   - **Profile Mismatch**: Agent Coral is ruled out as their profile does not match the likely perpetrator's.
   - **Profile Match and Profile Inconclusive**: No suspects are excluded.

5. **Alibi Verification**: Analyzes suspect's alibis during the crime:
   - **Alibi Confirmed**: Agent Coral is further ruled out based on a confirmed alibi.
   - **Alibi Unconfirmed and Disproved**: No suspects are excluded.

6. **Crime Scene Reconstruction**: Investigates required skills or access:
   - **Special Skills Required**: Mr. Gold is excluded due to necessary skills not being present.
   - **Physical Capability Required and Access Required**: No suspects are excluded.

## Conclusion

Through the careful execution of the aforementioned investigation actions, the following conclusions have been drawn regarding the suspects:

- **Mr. Gold** is excluded due to DNA analysis and crime scene reconstruction evidence.
- **Master Garnet** is excluded due to no email correspondence with the victim.
- **Magistrate Cream** is excluded due to handwriting mismatch.
- **Agent Coral** is excluded due to a profile mismatch and confirmed alibi.

With the remaining suspects excluded through these processes, your task is to further explore unidentified angles or assure all clues and evidence are meticulously evaluated to close the case effectively.

Use this guide to systematically apply each action and relate findings to the suspects to efficiently rule them out in accordance with gathered evidence. Remember, the goal is to identify who cannot be the perpetrator to focus on the true suspect confidently.
