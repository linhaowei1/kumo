# Guidebook: Identifying the Prime Suspect

---

## Introduction

This detective guidebook serves to instruct investigative teams on how to process evidence and gradually eliminate suspects to identify the prime suspect in criminal investigations. Using a structured approach based on specific investigation actions and their respective outcomes, detectives can rule out suspects, narrowing down the field and bringing clarity to who might have committed the crime. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how different investigative actions and their outcomes help in excluding suspects from the suspect list.

## The Suspects

In this particular case, you are tasked with investigating the following suspects:

1. **Captain Teal**
2. **Miss Scarlet**
3. **Lady Magenta**
4. **Padre Umber**

Each suspect will be evaluated based on the evidence collected through various investigative actions.

## Investigation Actions and Outcomes

### 1. GPS Tracking Data Review

This action involves examining the locations of suspects during critical times of the incident. The key outcomes help rule out suspects who could not be physically present at the crime scene.

- **Time Interval: (0, 2) hours**: No suspects can be ruled out, as no evidence was collected during this timeframe.
- **Time Interval: (2, 10) hours**: If activity is detected in this interval, **Lady Magenta** is ruled out.
- **Time Interval: (10, 100) hours**: No suspects can be ruled out, based on the absence of evidence.

### 2. Voice Recognition Test

This test determines if recorded voices match any of the suspects. Outcomes enable the exclusion of certain suspects based on voice analysis.

- **Male Voices Excluded**: No suspects are excluded based on the exclusion of male voices.
- **Female Voices Excluded**: **Miss Scarlet** is ruled out.
- **Voice Match Inconclusive**: No suspects can be ruled out due to inconclusive results.

### 3. Security Camera Footage Analysis

Reviewing security footage helps determine the presence, or absence, of suspects.

- **Suspect Not Seen on Footage**: **Captain Teal** can be ruled out if not seen.
- **Suspect Seen on Footage**: No suspects can be ruled out simply from visual analysis.
- **Footage Unavailable**: No ability to rule out suspects without footage.

### 4. Chemical Residue Testing

Testing traces of chemicals found at the crime scene can indicate suspects' involvement.

- **Residue Does Not Match**: **Lady Magenta** is ruled out based on residue discrepancies.
- **Residue Matches**: No suspects can be ruled out if residues are consistent with the scene.
- **No Residue Found**: No displacement of suspects can occur in the absence of residue.

### 5. Shoeprint Analysis

This involves comparing shoeprints found at the scene with those belonging to the suspects.

- **Size Interval: (5, 7)**: **Captain Teal** is ruled out due to a mismatch in shoe size.
- **Size Interval: (7, 9)**: No suspects are excluded based on this shoeprint analysis.
- **Size Interval: (9, 12)**: **Captain Teal** is ruled out due to another shoe size mismatch.

### 6. Interrogation

In-person questioning produces information that may yield contradictions or confirm alibis.

- **Solid Alibi**: **Miss Scarlet** is ruled out through verification of the alibi.
- **Suspicious Behavior**: No suspects can be ruled out solely due to behavioral observation.
- **Contradictory Statements**: No suspects can be ruled out without further corroborative evidence.

## Conclusion

Utilizing these investigative elements, eliminate suspects methodically by focusing on evidence and the described outcomes. This exclusionary approach enables the detective to gradually reduce the pool of suspects, ensuring only those who cannot be ruled out based on definitive evidence remain. Continue to adhere to this guidebook framework for consistent success in unraveling complex cases.

By ruling out suspects through clearly defined investigative actions and understanding the implications of their outcomes, investigators can approach cases with clarity and precision. Remember to compile any additional evidence that might further assist in determining the prime suspect, closing the case confidently and evidence-based.
