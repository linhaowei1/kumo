# The Detective's Guidebook to Prime Suspect Identification

Welcome to the art of detective work, where identifying a prime suspect is akin to solving a complex puzzle. In this guidebook, we'll delineate a process for determining who should be ruled out from our list of suspects based on specific investigation actions. Our suspects are Lieutenant Olive, Madame Ruby, Mr. Beige, and Baron Turquoise. Through comprehensive investigative methods, we'll narrow down the list, guiding you to the most likely perpetrator. 

## Suspects Overview

1. **Lieutenant Olive**: A military officer with potential access to secured areas. Known for precise weapon handling and disciplined routines.

2. **Madame Ruby**: A socialite with a wide network and various acquaintances. Her physical presence and activities are often noted due to her social stature.

3. **Mr. Beige**: A businessman with mysterious dealings, known to maintain records meticulously and travel frequently.

4. **Baron Turquoise**: An aristocrat with a penchant for privacy and a history of being in the wrong place at the right time.

## Investigation Actions and Rule-Out Outcomes

### 1. Weapon Tracing

Examining the origin and journey of the weapon used in the crime provides crucial insights:

- **Time Frame (0-5 hours)**: No suspects can be ruled out.
  
- **Time Frame (5-9 hours)**: Exclude Lieutenant Olive and Baron Turquoise from suspicion, as they were traced to unrelated activities during this time.
  
- **Time Frame (9-15 hours)**: No suspects can be ruled out.

### 2. GPS Tracking Data Review

Reviewing location data offers a timeline of movements for each suspect:

- **Time Frame (0-2 hours)**: Rule out Mr. Beige, who was recorded at an alibi location.
  
- **Time Frame (2-10 hours)**: Exclude Baron Turquoise, tracked far from the crime scene.

- **Time Frame (10-100 hours)**: No suspects can be ruled out.

### 3. Crime Scene Reconstruction

Analysis of crime scene requirements reveals the following exclusions:

- **Physical Capability Required**: Exclude Madame Ruby, as the task required physical strength beyond her known capabilities.

Matching shoeprints can pinpoint suspect movement or foreclose involvement:

- **Time Frame (7-9 hours)**: No suspects can be ruled out.

- **Time Frame (9-12 hours)**: Again, Lieutenant Olive's prints are found away from the scene, supporting his exclusion.
