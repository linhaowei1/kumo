# Detective Guidebook: A Comprehensive Approach to Prime Suspect Identification

## Introduction
In the complex world of investigations, identifying the prime suspect in a case involves a systematic approach guided by evidence and deductive reasoning. This guidebook provides a structured process to eliminate suspects from consideration based on specific investigative outcomes. The goal is to narrow down the list of potential perpetrators until the most probable individual remains.

### Suspects
The case under investigation involves the following individuals as potential suspects:

1. **Professor Plum**
2. **Reverend Mr. Black**

4. **Miss Silver**

Each suspect is considered equally likely at the start of the investigation but can be excluded based on concrete evidence obtained from various investigative actions.

### Investigation Actions
The investigative actions available in this case are:

1. **Shoeprint Analysis**
2. **Weapon Tracing**
3. **Hair Sample Analysis**
4. **Security Camera Footage Analysis**
5. **Paint Chip Analysis**
6. **Fingerprint Analysis**

### Outcomes and Exclusion Rules
For each investigative action, certain outcomes provide grounds to exclude specific suspects. These guidelines outline how each outcome impacts suspect identification:

#### 1. Shoeprint Analysis
- **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
  - Shoeprints of size between 5 and 7: Exclude **Lieutenant Olive**
  - Shoeprints of size between 7 and 9: Exclude **Miss Silver**
  - Shoeprints of size between 9 and 12: Exclude both **Miss Silver** and **Lieutenant Olive**

## Conclusion
This guide serves as a companion to effectively reducing the list of suspects based on the evidence collected during the investigative process. By methodically applying the exclusion rules outlined for each investigative action, detectives can eliminate suspects until the prime candidate is identified, ensuring an evidence-driven path to solving the case.
