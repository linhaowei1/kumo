# Detective Guidebook: Identifying the Prime Suspect

## Introduction
In any criminal investigation, identifying the prime suspect is crucial to solving the case. This guide provides a detailed process for ruling out suspects based on various investigative actions and outcomes. Our current case involves four suspects: Colonel Mustard, Mr. Beige, Judge Peach, and Empress Ivory. By methodically analyzing evidence and outcomes as detailed in this guide, detectives can effectively narrow down the list of suspects.

## Suspects
- **Colonel Mustard**: A distinguished individual known for a commanding presence.
- **Mr. Beige**: An unassuming figure with a penchant for blending into surroundings.
- **Judge Peach**: A respected legal authority with a firm grasp on justice.
- **Empress Ivory**: A figure of elegance and influence.

## Investigation Actions and Outcomes

### 1. Crime Scene Reconstruction
**Objective**: Re-create the crime scene to determine which suspects could physically commit the crime.

- **Physical Capability Required**: 
  - **Rule Out**: Empress Ivory
    - Empress Ivory does not have the physical capability required to have committed the crime based on the reconstruction.

### 2. Hair Sample Analysis
**Objective**: Compare hair samples collected from the crime scene with those of the suspects.

- **Black Hair Excluded**: 
  - **Rule Out**: Judge Peach
    - Judge Peach has black hair which does not match the hair samples found at the scene.

### 3. Voice Recognition Test
**Objective**: Analyze voice samples to rule out suspects.

- **Male Voices Excluded**: 
  - **Rule Out**: Colonel Mustard
    - Colonel Mustard's voice does not match any recordings associated with the crime.

### 4. Chemical Residue Testing
**Objective**: Identify chemical residues at the crime scene and compare them with substances associated with the suspects.

- **Residue Does Not Match**: 
  - **Rule Out**: Empress Ivory
    - No chemical residue found matches substances linked to Empress Ivory.

### 5. Fingerprint Analysis
**Objective**: Compare fingerprints from the crime scene with those of the suspects.

- **No Match**:
  - **Rule Out**: Colonel Mustard
    - Colonel Mustard's fingerprints do not match any prints found at the crime scene.

### 6. Handwriting Comparison
**Objective**: Compare handwriting on potential documents linked to the crime with suspect samples.

- **Mismatch**: 
  - **Rule Out**: Judge Peach
    - Judge Peach's handwriting does not match the documents connected to the crime.

## Conclusion
By systematically applying the investigative actions and interpreting the outcomes, detectives can eliminate suspects who do not match the evidence. Following the above steps, we can rule out:
- **Colonel Mustard** based on voice recognition and fingerprint analysis.
- **Judge Peach** due to hair sample analysis and handwriting mismatch.
- **Empress Ivory** due to physical capability and chemical residue testing.

Following these deductions, further investigations should be centered on Mr. Beige, who has not been ruled out by any of these examinations. Continuing the investigation with a focus on Mr. Beige will provide a clear path forward in solving the case.
