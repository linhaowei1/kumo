Welcome to the comprehensive guide for identifying prime suspects during an investigation. This guide focuses on methodically ruling out suspects based on specific investigation actions and observed outcomes. Our suspects for this investigation are as follows:

## Suspects:
1. **Mr. Beige**
2. **Nurse Mint**
3. **Madam Lavender**
4. **Miss Pink**

These individuals will be examined and potentially ruled out based on the evidence collected from the following investigative actions:

## Investigation Actions and Rule-Out Criteria

### 1. Blood Type Matching
The blood type evidence can help eliminate suspects based on incompatibility:

- **Type O Excluded**: Miss Pink is eliminated as her blood type does not match Type O.
- **Type A Excluded**: Madam Lavender is eliminated as her blood type does not match Type A.
- **Type AB Found**: No suspects are immediately ruled out by Type AB evidence.

### 2. Shoeprint Analysis
Shoeprints at the crime scene can also guide the elimination of suspects:

- **Sizes 5-7**: No suspects excluded for these shoe sizes.
- **Sizes 7-9**: Miss Pink is eliminated as she does not match these sizes.
- **Sizes 9-12**: Miss Pink is again ruled out for these shoe sizes.

### 3. GPS Tracking Data Review
Analyzing GPS data helps cross-reference suspect locations with the crime scene:

- **Time Window 0-2 hours**: Mr. Beige is ruled out as GPS data places him elsewhere during this time.
- **Time Window 2-10 hours**: No suspects are immediately ruled out.
- **Time Window 10-100 hours**: No suspects are immediately ruled out.

### 4. DNA Analysis
DNA evidence provides significant clues about suspect involvement:

- **Exclusion**: No suspects are immediately ruled out by DNA exclusion.
- **Inconclusive**: DNA results are inconclusive for all suspects.
- **Partial Match**: Mr. Beige is eliminated due to partial DNA match.

### 5. Social Media Investigation
This looks into the online activities of suspects and their social connections:

- **No Connection Found**: Madam Lavender is ruled out as there are no social media connections.
- **Frequent Interactions**: No suspects have significant interactions that warrant elimination.
- **Deleted Accounts**: No suspects eliminated based on account activity.

### 6. Toxicology Report
Substance analysis can clarify suspect involvement or elimination:

- **Time Window 0-2 hours**: No suspects are ruled out by toxicology during these hours.
- **Time Window 2-4 hours**: Madam Lavender is ruled out due to toxicology evidence in this timeframe.
- **Time Window 4-6 hours**: No suspects are immediately ruled out.

## Conclusion

By systematically applying these investigation actions, the list of suspects can be refined. Each piece of evidence and corresponding action plays a crucial role in the elimination process, leading to a more accurate identification of the prime suspect. Always ensure that conclusions are based on a comprehensive analysis of all available data. This guide aids in focusing investigative efforts efficiently and effectively.
