## Prime Suspect Identification Guidebook

## Introduction
In the realm of detective work, identifying the prime suspect is a meticulous process that involves analyzing various types of evidence and outcomes. Our guidebook is designed to assist investigators in understanding how to systematically exclude suspects from the list based on specific investigation actions and their outcomes. In this guide, we'll explore how each investigation action affects the suspect list provided: ['Mr. Gold', 'Bishop Cerulean', 'Mr. Green', 'Professor Sage'].

## Investigation Actions and Outcomes

### 1. Forensic Analysis
Forensic analysis involves examining physical evidence to glean information. 

- **Evidence Does Not Match**: If forensic analysis indicates that the evidence does not match, **Bishop Cerulean** is ruled out as a suspect.
  
- **Evidence Matches/Insufficient Evidence**: These outcomes do not exclude any suspects.

### 2. Shoeprint Analysis
Shoeprint analysis compares footprints found at the crime scene with those of potential suspects.

- **Shoe Size 5 to 7**: If this shoe size is identified, **Mr. Gold** and **Mr. Green** are ruled out as suspects.

- **Shoe Size 7 to 9**: **Mr. Gold** is ruled out as a suspect.

- **Shoe Size 9 to 12**: **Mr. Green** is ruled out as a suspect.

### 3. Interrogation
Interrogation involves questioning suspects to uncover alibis and inconsistencies.

- **Solid Alibi**: If a suspect provides a solid alibi, they are typically not involved. In this case, **Mr. Green** is ruled out as he has a solid alibi.

- **Suspicious Behavior/Contradictory Statements**: These outcomes do not exclude any suspects.

### 4. Weapon Tracing
Tracing a weapon involves identifying the history and current ownership of weapons related to the crime.

- **Caliber 0 to 5 / Caliber 5 to 9**: No suspects are ruled out in these ranges.

- **Caliber 9 to 15**: **Mr. Green** is ruled out as a suspect associated with this caliber.

### 5. Surveillance Footage Review
Reviewing surveillance footage can show suspect activity at or near crime scenes.

- **Suspect Not Seen**: **Professor Sage** is ruled out as there is no footage of him being present.
  
- **Suspect Seen/Footage Unclear**: These outcomes do not exclude any suspects.

### 6. DNA Analysis
DNA analysis provides a biological confirmation of a suspectâ€™s presence at the crime scene.

- **Exclusion**: DNA does not match **Mr. Gold**, thus he is ruled out.
  
- **Inconclusive/Partial Match**: These outcomes do not exclude any suspects.

## Conclusion
Using the processes outlined in this guidebook, investigators can systematically narrow down the list of suspects by ruling them out based on specific outcomes of each investigation action. By understanding and applying these principles, detectives can effectively streamline their suspect identification process, allowing them to focus their resources on the most likely culprits.
