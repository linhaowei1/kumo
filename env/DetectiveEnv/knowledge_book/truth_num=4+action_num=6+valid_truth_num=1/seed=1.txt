# Detective Guidebook: Prime Suspect Identification Process

This guidebook is designed to assist detectives in systematically narrowing down suspects in a criminal investigation through a series of methodical investigation actions. By systematically ruling out suspects based on forensic and investigative outcomes, we aim to efficiently identify the prime suspect from a list of potential individuals.

## Suspect List

In this investigation, the primary suspects are:

- **Mr. Brown**
- **Mademoiselle Saffron**
- **Empress Ivory**
- **Miss Scarlet** 

These individuals are the starting point for our investigation. By conducting various investigative actions and analyzing outcomes, we can eliminate suspects who are not consistent with the evidence.

## Investigation Actions and Outcomes

For each investigation action, we will describe its purpose and detail the outcomes that allow us to rule out certain suspects. Each listed outcome has a direct implication on the suspects, specifically identifying who can be excluded from suspicion based on the evidence.

### 1. Weapon Tracing

This action involves tracing the weapon used in the crime to determine any potential connections to the suspects.

**Outcomes:**

- **Weapon found with usage history between 0 to 5 days**: Exclude **Mademoiselle Saffron**.
- **Weapon found with usage history between 5 to 9 days**: No exclusions based on this outcome.
- **Weapon found with usage history between 9 to 15 days**: No exclusions based on this outcome.

### 2. Voice Recognition Test

The purpose of this test is to analyze recorded voices found at the crime scene and determine if any suspect can be ruled out based on voice characteristics.

**Outcomes:**

- **Male Voices Excluded**: Exclude **Mr. Brown**.
- **Female Voices Excluded**: Exclude **Miss Scarlet**.
- **Voice Match Inconclusive**: No exclusions based on this outcome.

### 3. Fiber Sample Comparison

Fiber analysis is conducted to compare fibers found at the crime scene with those potentially linked to the suspects.

**Outcomes:**

- **Fiber Mismatch**: Exclude **Miss Scarlet**.
- **Possible Match**: No exclusions based on this outcome.
- **No Fibers Found**: No exclusions based on this outcome.

### 4. DNA Analysis

DNA testing is used to examine biological samples to eliminate suspects who do not match the evidence.

**Outcomes:**

- **Exclusion**: Exclude **Mr. Brown**.
- **Inconclusive**: No exclusions based on this outcome.
- **Partial Match**: No exclusions based on this outcome.

### 5. Crime Scene Reconstruction

Reconstructing the events of the crime can help determine which suspects possessed the physical capability and access to commit the crime.

**Outcomes:**

- **Physical Capability Required**: Exclude **Empress Ivory**.
- **Special Skills Required**: No exclusions based on this outcome.
- **Access Required**: No exclusions based on this outcome.

### 6. Chemical Residue Testing

This action tests for chemical residues at the crime scene to understand the materials involved and rule out suspects based on the matching of residue.

**Outcomes:**

- **Residue Does Not Match**: Exclude **Empress Ivory**.
- **Residue Matches**: No exclusions based on this outcome.
- **No Residue Found**: No exclusions based on this outcome.

## Conclusions

By applying these investigative actions and carefully analyzing the outcomes, detectives can systematically eliminate suspects from the list. The goal is to narrow down our potential suspects using rigorous evidence-based exclusions, ultimately identifying the prime suspect responsible for the crime.

Always remember, each investigative action provides crucial data points, and the exclusions made based on this data must be documented thoroughly for decision transparency and integrity of the investigation process.
