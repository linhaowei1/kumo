# Detective Guidebook: Identifying the Prime Suspect

## Introduction

In any investigation, identifying the prime suspect is a crucial step. This guidebook outlines a clear process for using various investigative actions and their outcomes to rule out suspects involved in a case. Based on a structured approach, each action provides specific insights that help eliminate suspects, narrowing down the pool to find the individual most likely responsible.

## Suspects Overview

In our case, we have four potential suspects:

1. **Bishop Cerulean**
2. **Dame Cobalt**
3. **Reverend Mr. Black**
4. **Mister Navy**

## Investigation Actions and Outcomes

### 1. Social Media Investigation
Social media can reveal connections or suspicious behavior.
- **No Connection Found**: Excludes **Mister Navy** and **Dame Cobalt** if no ties are found.
- **Frequent Interactions**: If discovered, would imply no suspects are excluded from this connection.
- **Deleted Accounts**: No suspects excluded if accounts are found deleted.

### 2. Hair Sample Analysis
Hair color can be a vital clue in identifying or excluding suspects.
- **Blonde Hair Excluded**: Currently, does not exclude any suspects.
- **Black Hair Excluded**: Rules out **Reverend Mr. Black**.
- **Red Hair Match**: If matched, would not exclude any current suspects.

### 3. Forensic Analysis
Physical evidence can strengthen or weaken a suspect's connection to the crime.
- **Evidence Does Not Match**: Excludes **Bishop Cerulean** if forensic evidence doesnâ€™t match.
- **Evidence Matches**: Currently, does not result in any exclusions.
- **Insufficient Evidence**: No action taken if evidence is inconclusive.

### 4. Financial Transaction Tracking
Tracking financial transactions can indicate motive and opportunity.
- **Transactions Between $0 and $5000**: Excludes **Mister Navy** and **Dame Cobalt** due to limited financial movement.
- **Transactions Between $5000 and $100000**: Currently, doesn't exclude any suspects.
- **Transactions Above $100000**: No exclusions currently, but high-value transactions can be significant.

### 5. Toxicology Report
Substance analysis can identify or eliminate suspects based on chemical exposure.
- **Substance Levels 0 to 2**: No exclusions.
- **Substance Levels 2 to 4**: Excludes **Mister Navy** if levels fall between these ranges.
- **Substance Levels 4 to 6**: No exclusions at these levels.

### 6. Blood Type Matching
Blood type can definitively rule out suspects based on compatibility with found evidence.
- **Type O Excluded**: Currently, does not exclude any suspects.
- **Type A Excluded**: Excludes **Mister Navy** as a suspect.
- **Type AB Found**: If found, doesn't currently exclude any suspects.

## Conclusion

The prime suspect identification process relies on systematically ruling out individuals based on the outcomes of investigative actions. By observing each action's outcomes, detectives can narrow down the list of suspects and focus on those with a higher probability of involvement. This logical deduction ensures a thorough and effective means of approaching criminal investigations. Always document findings meticulously and follow leads as evidence dictates for a successful resolution.
