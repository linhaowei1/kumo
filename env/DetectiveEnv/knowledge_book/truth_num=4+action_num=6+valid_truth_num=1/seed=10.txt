# Detective Guidebook: Prime Suspect Identification Process

This guidebook aims to provide a methodical and clear approach to identifying the prime suspect based on specific investigation actions and the outcomes associated with each suspect. We will explore how each piece of evidence or clue can help eliminate suspects, narrowing down the potential responsible party.

## Suspects Overview

Before diving into the investigation actions, it's essential to know our primary suspects:

1. **Mademoiselle Saffron**
2. **Colonel Mustard**
3. **Lady Magenta**
4. **Madame Ruby**

Each suspect is under scrutiny based on the evidence gathered from the various investigative techniques.

## Investigation Actions and Rule-Out Criteria

### 1. Crime Scene Reconstruction

During a crime scene reconstruction, various aspects such as the physical capability required and special skills or access needs are evaluated against the suspects.

- **Physical Capability Required**: Madame Ruby is ruled out as she does **not** have the required physical capability.
- **Special Skills Required**: No suspects are ruled out based on special skills.
- **Access Required**: No suspects are ruled out based on site access.

### 2. GPS Tracking Data Review

The review of GPS data helps to establish alibis or locate suspect whereabouts during specific time frames:

- **Timeframe (0, 2 hours)**: No suspects are ruled out.
- **Timeframe (2, 10 hours)**: Lady Magenta is ruled out as she was present in a different location.
- **Timeframe (10, 100 hours)**: No suspects are ruled out.

### 3. Voice Recognition Test

Voice recognition testing excludes suspects whose voice does not match the audio evidence:

- **Male Voices Excluded**: Colonel Mustard is ruled out due to exclusion based on voice properties.
- **Female Voices Excluded**: No suspects are ruled out.
- **Voice Match Inconclusive**: No suspects are ruled out.

### 4. Fingerprint Analysis

Fingerprint evidence is crucial in directly ruling out or implicating suspects:

- **No Match**: Colonel Mustard is ruled out as his fingerprints do not match the evidence.
- **Partial Match**: No suspects are ruled out based on a partial match.
- **Match Found**: No suspects are eliminated as contributors are not determined.

### 5. Shoeprint Analysis

Shoeprint analysis helps narrow down suspects based on shoe size and tread patterns.

- **Size Range (5, 7)**: Colonel Mustard is ruled out as his shoe size does **not** fall within this range.
- **Size Range (7, 9)**: Colonel Mustard is ruled out as his shoe size does **not** fall within this range.
- **Size Range (9, 12)**: No suspects are ruled out.

### 6. Chemical Residue Testing

Residue testing determines whether any suspect had contact with specific substances at the crime scene:

- **Residue Does Not Match**: Lady Magenta is ruled out as the residue found does not match substances linked to her.
- **Residue Matches**: No suspects are ruled out.
- **No Residue Found**: No suspects are ruled out.

## Conclusion

By applying the above-mentioned criteria systematically, we effectively narrow down our list of potential suspects. Consistent application of the rule-out methodology across different investigation actions ensures an objective approach in eliminating those unlikely to have committed the crime. This guide should aid detectives in strategically focusing on those suspects who remain viable following evidence evaluation. Through this process, the identification of the prime suspect becomes clear and defensible.
