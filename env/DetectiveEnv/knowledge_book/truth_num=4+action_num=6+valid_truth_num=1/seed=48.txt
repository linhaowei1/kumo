# Detective Guidebook: Identifying the Prime Suspect

## Introduction
Identifying the prime suspect in an investigation requires careful analysis of evidence and thoughtful consideration of the outcomes of various investigative actions. This guidebook outlines the process of identifying the prime suspect by examining key evidence and interpreting it through the lens of exclusionâ€”eliminating suspects who can be ruled out based on the outcomes of each investigative action.

### Suspects Overview
Before we dive into the investigation process, let's introduce the potential suspects involved in our case:

1. **Padre Umber**
2. **Dr. Crimson**
3. **Mr. Brown**
4. **Magistrate Cream**

### Investigation Actions and Outcomes

To systematically identify the prime suspect, the following investigative actions will be conducted. Each action is coupled with possible outcomes that assist in ruling out suspects. 

#### 1. Handwriting Comparison
- **Mismatch:** If the handwriting comparison results in a mismatch, **Magistrate Cream** is to be ruled out.

#### 2. Weapon Tracing
- **Distance 0-5:** If the weapon is traced within a range of 0 to 5 miles, **Padre Umber** is ruled out.
- **Distance 5-9:** If the weapon is traced within a range of 5 to 9 miles, **Dr. Crimson** is ruled out.
- **Distance 9-15:** No suspects can be conclusively ruled out based on this evidence.

#### 3. Toxicology Report
- **Range 0-2:** If the toxic substances are traced to within a range of 0 to 2 units, **Padre Umber** is ruled out.
- **Range 2-4 and 4-6:** No suspects can be conclusively ruled out with these results.

#### 4. Security Camera Footage Analysis
- **Suspect Not Seen on Footage:** If the suspect is not seen on the footage, then **Dr. Crimson** can be ruled out, as there is no visual evidence linking him to the scene.

#### 5. Fiber Sample Comparison
- **Fiber Mismatch:** If fiber samples result in a mismatch, **Dr. Crimson** is ruled out from consideration.

#### 6. Financial Record Audit
- **No Suspicious Activity:** If there is no suspicious activity in financial records, **Padre Umber** is ruled out.
- **Unexplained Deposits and Large Debts:** No suspects can be conclusively ruled out with these financial circumstances.

## Conclusion
In an investigation, identifying the prime suspect necessitates a process of elimination based on evidence that rules out certain individuals from suspicion. By understanding the outcomes of key actions, investigators can progressively narrow down the list of potential suspects. It is essential to be thorough and deliberate with this approach to ensure that only the most probable individual is considered the primary suspect. By using this guidebook, you are equipped to conduct a structured and effective investigation.
