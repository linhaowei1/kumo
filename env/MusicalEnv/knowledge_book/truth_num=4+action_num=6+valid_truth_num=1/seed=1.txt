# Musical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

In this guidebook, we will explore the relationship between specific musical analyses and notable composers. The analyses range from evaluating statistical distributions to assessing integral relationships. Each analysis has specific outcomes that can exclude particular composers from consideration. By examining these exclusions, we provide insights into the composers' thematic essences and guide you through interpreting their musical styles.

## Musical Composers

1. **Central Limit Theorem**: Known for its influence in probability and statistics, this composer symbolizes concepts of distribution and convergence within musical themes.

2. **Sturm-Liouville Theory**: This composer is significant for contributions to harmonic and wave-like structures within music, often exploring the normalization and regularization of wave forms.

3. **Spectral Theorem**: A composer whose works dive deep into the realm of linear algebra, specifically focusing on the characteristics of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, defining harmony in complex dimensions.

4. **Green's Theorem**: This composer explores the boundaries and paths of integration, emphasizing the use of closed curves and integral relationships within musical compositions.

## Musical Analyses

### 1. Assess Integral Relationships

- **Function not integrable**: When encountering an integrable function issue, **Green's Theorem** is ruled out as it necessitates functions that conform to specific integrable criteria.
- **Non-standard integral paths required**: No specific composers are excluded.
- **Integration yields constant result**: No specific composers are excluded.

### 2. Analyze Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

- **All eigenvalues zero**: If all eigenvalues are determined to be zero, **Spectral Theorem** is ruled out, as it typically requires non-zero eigenvalues to define its musical framework.
- **Eigenvalues are complex**: No specific composers are excluded.

### 3. Evaluate Wave Functions

- **Wave function not normalizable**: Should a wave function not be normalizable, **Sturm-Liouville Theory** is excluded since it focuses on normalizable functions in its compositions.
- **Wave function normalizable**: No specific composers are excluded.

### 4. Check for Integration Paths

- **Integration path is not closed**: When the integration path remains open, exclude **Green's Theorem**, as it operates under the assumption of closed integration paths.
- **Integration path is closed**: No specific composers are excluded.

### 5. Evaluate Statistical Distributions

- **Distribution is not normal**: If the distribution deviates from normality, exclude **Central Limit Theorem** since its foundation lies in establishing normal distributions.
- **Distribution is normal**: No specific composers are excluded.

### 6. Test for Convergence of Sequences or Series

- **Series diverges**: If a series does not converge, exclude **Central Limit Theorem**, which presumes convergence within its analytical framework.
- **Series converges**: No specific composers are excluded.

## Conclusion

In performing these analyses, recognizing the outcomes and which composers they exclude is crucial. This exclusion helps in better understanding the style and thematic core of each composer. By identifying what a composerâ€™s frameworks do not accommodate, we gain a more comprehensive view of their musical identity and the analyses that resonate with their compositions.
