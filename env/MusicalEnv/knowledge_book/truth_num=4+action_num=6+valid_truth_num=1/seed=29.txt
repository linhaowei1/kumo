# A Guide to Analyzing Musical Composers by Thematic Theorems

Welcome to our musical analysis guidebook! Here, we introduce a unique blend of mathematical concepts and musical theory centered around four imaginative musical composers: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Banach-Tarski Paradox, Green's Theorem, and Spectral Theorem. Each composer offers distinct stylistic outcomes characterized by various theoretical analyses. Our aim is to explore and interpret these outcomes based on exclusionary principles, all within the realm of musical creativity.

## Musical Composers

1. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: Embodying the core principles of calculus, this composer’s work often revolves around themes of continuity and integration. It intertwines the concepts of differentiation and integration, symbolizing a harmonious unification of mathematical elements.

2. **Banach-Tarski Paradox**: Known for its surprising and counter-intuitive results, this composer thrives on paradoxical possibilities and themes of decomposition, often leaving listeners in wonder of the seemingly impossible.

3. **Green’s Theorem**: Just like its namesake theorem that connects micro-level behavior to macro-level properties, this composer’s music delves into integration paths and integral relationships, offering a range of deeply interconnected musical journeys.

4. **Spectral Theorem**: With an affinity for understanding structures and dimensions, this composer focuses on eigenvalues and eigenvectors, capturing music's spectral dimensions and the hauntingly beautiful spaces within.

## Musical Analyses

### 1. Evaluate Function Continuity
- **Discontinuities Detected**: When discontinuities in a musical piece are recognized, exclude "Fundamental Theorem of Calculus". This composer ordinarily maintains continuity in their compositions.
- **Function Continuous Everywhere**: If a musical piece exhibits continuity without exception, no composers are specific to this outcome.

### 2. Investigate Paradoxical Decompositions
- **Paradoxical Decomposition Possible**: When encountering paradoxical decomposition, exclude "Banach-Tarski Paradox" for it often challenges the perceived boundaries and invokes such decompositions. 
- **Paradoxical Decomposition Not Possible**: No composer fits this outcome directly.

### 3. Analyze Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- **All Eigenvalues Zero**: In cases where all eigenvalues are zero, exclude "Spectral Theorem" because this composer explores dynamic and non-zero spectral dimensions.
- **Eigenvalues are Complex**: There are no exclusions based on this observation.

### 4. Check for Integration Paths
- **Integration Path is Not Closed**: When an integration path within a musical composition does not close, exclude "Green’s Theorem", whose works delve into closed form integrations.
- **Integration Path is Closed**: There are no specific composers to exclude with this outcome.

### 5. Assess Integral Relationships
- **Function Not Integrable**: If a composition is found to be not integrable, exclude both "Green’s Theorem" and "Fundamental Theorem of Calculus", as integrability is intrinsic to their thematic expression.
- **Non-standard Integral Paths Required**: No specific outcomes for exclusions here.
- **Integration Yields Constant Result**: No composers are confined solely to this result.

### 6. Analyze Geometric Figures
- **No Right Angles Detected**: No set exclusions in this scenario.
- **No Symmetry Observed**: Similarly, no restrictions apply here.
- **Non-planar Graph Observed**: This observation does not require specific exclusions.

## Conclusion

By understanding the exclusionary nature of these analyses and outcomes, one can better parse the thematic intricacies of our four composers. Through this guidebook, we hope to provide a clear lens into the fusion of mathematical principles and musical exploration, allowing for both focused analysis and free-flowing creativity. Enjoy the journey through this world of harmonious logic and paradoxical beauty.
