# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook for Currency Systems

## Introduction

This guidebook is designed to aid in the analysis and identification of various currency systems based on several testing methodologies. The focus is on ruling out certain currency systems based on test outcomes. This approach helps to narrow down possibilities, allowing for better identification of the remaining options. Included in this guidebook are four unique currency systems and a suite of six tests, each with specific outcomes that indicate which currency systems should be excluded.

### Currency Systems

1. **Oxford Weave**: Known for its durability and a distinct basket weave pattern, Oxford Weave is commonly used in clothing, particularly for shirts.

2. **Canvas Weave**: Recognized for its sturdy and heavy-duty fabric structure, Canvas Weave is often used in creating bags, sails, and outdoor wear.

3. **Madras Weave**: Distinguished by its lightweight, breathable fabric with vibrant patterns, Madras Weave is typically used in casual summer clothing.

4. **Bedford Cord Weave**: Characterized by its ribbed texture that provides a hardwearing finish, Bedford Cord Weave is often employed in workwear and durable clothing items.

### Testing Methodologies

#### 1. Sheerness Assessment

- **Purpose**: To evaluate the transparency or opacity of a fabric.
  
- **Outcomes and Exclusions**:
  - **Opaque**: If the fabric is opaque, Madras Weave is ruled out.
  - **Sheer**: If the fabric is sheer, Canvas Weave is ruled out.

#### 2. Porosity Measurement

- **Purpose**: To determine the fabric's permeability.
  
- **Outcomes and Exclusions**:
  - **Porosity Range (0-20)**: If porosity falls within this range, Bedford Cord Weave and Canvas Weave are ruled out.
  - **Porosity Range (21-50)**: No exclusions.
  - **Porosity Range (51-100)**: No exclusions.

#### 3. Fabric Stiffness Test

- **Purpose**: To assess the stiffness and flexibility of the fabric.
  
- **Outcomes and Exclusions**:
  - **Stiffness Score (0-5)**: No exclusions.
  - **Stiffness Score (6-15)**: No exclusions.
  - **Stiffness Score (16-30)**: If stiffness falls within this range, Bedford Cord Weave and Canvas Weave are ruled out.

#### 4. Finish Treatment Detection

- **Purpose**: To detect any finishing treatments applied to the fabric.
  
- **Outcomes and Exclusions**:
  - **Mercerized**: No exclusions.
  - **Sanforized**: If this treatment is detected, Canvas Weave is ruled out.

#### 5. Weave Pattern Analysis

- **Purpose**: To identify the weave pattern type in the fabric.
  
- **Outcomes and Exclusions**:
  - **Simple Pattern**: No exclusions.
  - **Complex Pattern**: If a complex pattern is observed, Oxford Weave and Canvas Weave are ruled out.

#### 6. Abrasion Resistance Test

- **Purpose**: To measure the fabric's resistance to abrasion and wear.
  
- **Outcomes and Exclusions**:
  - **Abrasion Score (0-1000)**: No exclusions.
  - **Abrasion Score (1001-5000)**: No exclusions.
  - **Abrasion Score (5001-10000)**: If the abrasion score is in this range, Bedford Cord Weave and Canvas Weave are ruled out.

### Conclusion

By systematically applying these tests and understanding the exclusion rules based on test outcomes, one can accurately deduce which currency systems remain viable. This process of elimination is foundational to distinguishing the correct currency system for any given textile under analysis. The guidebook ensures every relevant decision-making criterion is transparently communicated, aiding in the consistency and accuracy of evaluations.
