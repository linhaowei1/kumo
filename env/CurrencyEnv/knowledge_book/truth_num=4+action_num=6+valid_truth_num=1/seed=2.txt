# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook: Currency Systems and Testing

In this guidebook, we introduce a methodical approach to analyzing trade tokens by exploring various currency systems being assessed through a series of tests. The currency systems in focus are:

- **Pile Weave**
- **Jacquard Weave**
- **Bedford Cord Weave**
- **Whipcord Weave**

Each system undergoes specific tests aimed at determining their characteristics. These tests serve to exclude certain currency systems based on observed outcomes. Importantly, none of the tests confirm a system; they only exclude systems that do not align with the test results. Below is a detailed explanation of these systems, tests, and the criteria for exclusion based on the outcomes.

## Currency Systems

1. **Pile Weave**: Known for its thickness and plush texture, typically resulting from tufts or loops of yarn standing upright from the base fabric. It's closely associated with heavier and thicker fabric characteristics.

2. **Jacquard Weave**: Recognized for its intricate and complex woven patterns, often featuring detailed and multi-colored designs achieved through a specialized loom.

3. **Bedford Cord Weave**: Features a sturdy fabric often with a ribbed or corded surface, providing durability and a less porous nature.

4. **Whipcord Weave**: Distinguished by its tightly woven, ridged surface, offering robust and abrasion-resistant qualities.

## Tests and Outcomes

### 1. Weave Pattern Analysis

- **Objective**: To assess the complexity of the weave pattern in the fabric.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Simple Pattern**: When observed, Jacquard Weave is ruled out, as it's known for complex patterns.
  - **Complex Pattern**: No currency systems are excluded.

### 2. Fabric Weight Measurement

- **Objective**: To measure the heaviness of the fabric, typically in grams per square meter.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **0-150 g/m²**: Excludes Pile Weave and Whipcord Weave, usually heavier.
  - **151-300 g/m²**: No currency systems are excluded.
  - **301-600 g/m²**: No currency systems are excluded.

### 3. Porosity Measurement

- **Objective**: To determine the openness or permeability of the weave.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **0-20% Porosity**: Excludes Bedford Cord Weave and Whipcord Weave, known for being less porous.
  - **21-50% Porosity**: No currency systems are excluded.
  - **51-100% Porosity**: No currency systems are excluded.

### 4. Abrasion Resistance Test

- **Objective**: To evaluate the fabric's ability to withstand wear and tear.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **0-1000 Cycles**: No currency systems are excluded.
  - **1001-5000 Cycles**: No currency systems are excluded.
  - **5001-10000 Cycles**: Excludes Bedford Cord Weave and Whipcord Weave due to their high abrasion resilience.

### 5. Sheerness Assessment

- **Objective**: To assess the transparency or opacity of the fabric.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Opaque**: No currency systems are excluded.
  - **Sheer**: Excludes Whipcord Weave, typically not associated with sheerness.

### 6. Tensile Strength Test

- **Objective**: To evaluate the force required to break the fabric under tension.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **0-200 N**: No currency systems are excluded.
  - **201-500 N**: No currency systems are excluded.
  - **501-1000 N**: Excludes Bedford Cord Weave and Whipcord Weave, known for higher tensile strength.

## Conclusion

Understanding these tests and their exclusion criteria is essential for identifying potential trade token systems within the context of woven fabrics. By systematically applying each test to the identified systems, stakeholders can efficiently narrow down viable options, resulting in a more comprehensive and informed analysis. This guidebook ensures that decisions are made based on concrete test outcomes, providing a clear framework for evaluating trade tokens in woven currency systems.
