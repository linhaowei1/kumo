# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Trade Token Analysis Guidebook. This guidebook aims to provide a structured approach to analyzing and categorizing different currency systems using specific testing methodologies. Each test offers insights that help in excluding certain currency systems, enhancing the accuracy of identification and classification. The systems under consideration are 'Rib Weave', 'Plain Weave', 'Mock Leno Weave', and 'Huckaback Weave'. By understanding and applying these tests, you will be able to methodically eliminate possibilities and narrow down the range of viable currency systems.

## Currency Systems Overview

- **Rib Weave**: A textile weave characterized by prominent ribs, produced by using a heavier yarn, or by using more warp or weft threads.

- **Plain Weave**: The simplest form of weaving, where the weft alternates over and under successive warp threads. This is a fundamental structural weave that is very common.

- **Mock Leno Weave**: A variation of leno weave that mimics the texture of leno by using a combination of floats and variations in the weave. It creates texture and visual interest.

- **Huckaback Weave**: A weave that creates a textured surface, often used for towels due to its high absorbency.

## Tests and Exclusion Outcomes

Each test is designed to examine specific attributes of the textile and inform which currency systems can be excluded based on the results. The exclusions help in narrowing down which currency system is not a match.

### 1. Fiber Content Examination

This test identifies the material composition of the textile. Certain materials are indicative of the exclusion of specific currency systems.

- **Cotton**: No exclusions.
- **Silk**: Exclude **Plain Weave**.
- **Wool**: Exclude **Mock Leno Weave**.
- **Synthetic**: Exclude **Huckaback Weave**.
- **Linen**: No exclusions.
- **Blend**: Exclude **Plain Weave**.

### 2. Thread Count Measurement

This involves counting the number of threads per square inch, affecting the texture and feel.

- **0 to 100 threads**: No exclusions.
- **101 to 300 threads**: No exclusions.
- **301 to 600 threads**: Exclude **Huckaback Weave**.

### 3. Weft and Warp Count Analysis

Analysis of the ratio of weft (horizontal) and warp (vertical) threads aids in identifying the weave structure.

- **1:1 ratio**: Exclude **Plain Weave**.
- **2:1 ratio**: Exclude **Rib Weave**.
- **3:1 ratio**: No exclusions.

### 4. Float Length Measurement

Float length measures the extent to which threads extend over other threads without being interwoven.

- **0 to 2 units**: Exclude **Plain Weave**.
- **3 to 5 units**: No exclusions.
- **6 to 10 units**: No exclusions.

### 5. Surface Texture Analysis

This test analyzes the texture of the woven surface, contributing to its tactile and visual qualities.

- **Smooth texture**: No exclusions.
- **Textured surface**: Exclude **Plain Weave**.

### 6. Porosity Measurement

Porosity measures the openness of the weave and its ability to allow air and water to pass through.

- **0 to 20% porosity**: No exclusions.
- **21 to 50% porosity**: No exclusions.
- **51 to 100% porosity**: Exclude **Huckaback Weave**.

## Conclusion

By executing these tests and observing the outcomes, you can effectively exclude certain currency systems from consideration, thereby refining your analysis and making sound judgments. This systematic approach ensures precision and accuracy in identifying the most suitable currency system based on test results. Remember, exclusions are powerful indicators of pathways you should not pursue, honing your focus on the feasible options available.
