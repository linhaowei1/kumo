# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook is designed to help analyze and differentiate between specific currency systems using a set of standardized tests. The currency systems in question are woven fabrics, namely the Ottoman Weave, Oxford Weave, Diamond Twill Weave, and Waffle Weave. Each fabric can be characterized and identified via a series of tests. By understanding the outcomes of these tests, you can effectively rule out certain weaves, narrowing down to the most likely currency system.

## Currency Systems
Before we delve into the tests, let's familiarize ourselves with the weave types in question:

1. **Ottoman Weave**: Known for its pronounced ribbed texture, often used in heavy fabrics.
2. **Oxford Weave**: A soft, yet durable weave, typically recognized by its basket-like structure.
3. **Diamond Twill Weave**: Features a series of diagonal lines creating a diamond pattern.
4. **Waffle Weave**: Characterized by a textured surface resembling a honeycomb or waffle pattern.

## Tests and Interpretations
A series of analytical tests can help identify and distinguish these weaves. Each test's outcomes will guide us in ruling out certain weaves, based on the rules established below:

### 1. Thread Count Measurement
This test measures the number of threads per inch in the fabric.

- **0-100 Threads**: No weaves are explicitly ruled out.
- **101-300 Threads**: No weaves are explicitly ruled out.
- **301-600 Threads**: Exclude **Waffle Weave**.

### 2. Yarn Twist Direction Test
Examines the direction of the yarn twists.

- **S-Twist**: Exclude **Diamond Twill Weave**.
- **Z-Twist**: Exclude **Oxford Weave**.

### 3. Weft and Warp Count Analysis
This test focuses on the number of wefts and warp yarns.

- **1:1 Ratio**: No weaves are explicitly ruled out.
- **2:1 Ratio**: Exclude **Ottoman Weave**.
- **3:1 Ratio**: No weaves are explicitly ruled out.

### 4. Fiber Content Examination
Identifies the material composition of the fabric.

- **Cotton**: No weaves are explicitly ruled out.
- **Silk**: Exclude **Oxford Weave**.
- **Wool**: No weaves are explicitly ruled out.
- **Synthetic**: Exclude **Waffle Weave**.
- **Linen**: No weaves are explicitly ruled out.
- **Blend**: Exclude **Oxford Weave**.

### 5. Weave Pattern Analysis
Assesses the complexity of the weave pattern.

- **Simple Pattern**: No weaves are explicitly ruled out.
- **Complex Pattern**: Exclude **Oxford Weave**.

### 6. Surface Texture Analysis
Looks at the tactile quality of the surface.

- **Smooth Texture**: Exclude **Waffle Weave**.
- **Textured Surface**: No weaves are explicitly ruled out.

## Conclusion
By following the results of these tests and applying the corresponding rule-out criteria, you can effectively narrow down which weave corresponds to the material you are analyzing. Understanding these tests and the specific attributes of each fabric is crucial for accurate identification and differentiation among the various weave types.

This guide serves as a comprehensive tool for accurately ruling out impossible matches, allowing you to focus on more likely candidates in fabric analysis. As you become more familiar with these tests and criteria, identifying the correct currency system becomes an intuitive and systematic process.
