# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Trade Token Analysis Guidebook, your definitive resource for understanding and testing various currency systems through specific tests. This guide will help you discern different fabric or weave currencies by ruling out incompatible types based on observed test outcomes.

## Currency Systems

In our context, currency systems refer to distinct types of weaves or fabric patterns that we need to differentiate between. The systems we analyze are:

1. **Bedford Cord Weave**: Known for its durable and ribbed texture, commonly used in structured garments like trousers.

2. **Chevron Weave**: Identified by its V-shaped patterns and offers a zigzag appearance, providing a stylish choice for decorative purposes.

3. **Plain Weave**: The most basic weaving pattern, characterized by a simple over-and-under, offering versatility and durability.

4. **Sheer Weave**: Typically lightweight and transparent, making it ideal for creating curtains or lightweight garments.

## Tests and Rule-Out Outcomes

To determine which currency systems to exclude based on observed characteristics, we perform various tests. Here's a detailed explanation of each test and how the outcomes help rule out specific currency systems:

### 1. Fiber Content Examination

- **Cotton**: No specific currency systems are excluded.
- **Silk**: Excludes **Plain Weave**.
- **Wool**: Excludes **Sheer Weave**.
- **Synthetic**: No specific currency systems are excluded.
- **Linen**: No specific currency systems are excluded.
- **Blend**: Excludes **Plain Weave**.

### 2. Finish Treatment Detection

- **Mercerized**: Excludes **Plain Weave**.
- **Sanforized**: No specific currency systems are excluded.

### 3. Fabric Stiffness Test

- **Stiffness Range (0–5)**: Excludes **Sheer Weave**.
- **Stiffness Range (6–15)**: No specific currency systems are excluded.
- **Stiffness Range (16–30)**: Excludes **Bedford Cord Weave**.

### 4. Fabric Weight Measurement

- **Weight Range (0–150)**: No specific currency systems are excluded.
- **Weight Range (151–300)**: No specific currency systems are excluded.
- **Weight Range (301–600)**: Excludes **Sheer Weave**.

### 5. Surface Texture Analysis

- **Smooth**: No specific currency systems are excluded.
- **Textured**: Excludes **Plain Weave**.

### 6. Thickness Measurement

- **Thickness Range (0–0.5)**: No specific currency systems are excluded.
- **Thickness Range (0.6–1.5)**: No specific currency systems are excluded.
- **Thickness Range (1.6–5.0)**: Excludes **Sheer Weave**.

## Summary

By systematically applying these tests and observing the outcomes, specific weave systems can be effectively ruled out, narrowing down the possibilities of what fabric you are dealing with. This process ensures a more accurate identification of fabric types based on their physical and chemical properties, helping in selecting the right material for your needs or validating its authenticity.

Always ensure to follow each step and interpret the results carefully to make informed decisions based on the exclusion principles outlined. This guide provides a structured approach to fabric analysis, simplifying complexities within the diverse world of textile weaves.
