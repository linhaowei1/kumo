# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to provide a comprehensive approach to analyzing trade tokens using a set of systematic evaluations across different currency systems. We will introduce and explain four distinct currency systems, followed by a detailed breakdown of tests that can be applied to determine which systems can be ruled out based on observed outcomes.

## Currency Systems

1. **Leno Weave**: Known for its complex weave patterns, the Leno Weave typically has a high level of porosity and unique selvage known as Lenape Selvage. It is often opaque and can vary in weave density.

2. **Chevron Weave**: Distinguished by its classic zig-zag patterns, Chevron Weave is known for its aesthetic appeal but is less commonly associated with unique functional characteristics in this context.

3. **Brocade Weave**: Characterized by its simple pattern and dense structure, Brocade Weave is often crafted from cotton and is considered opaque.

4. **Double Cloth Weave**: This currency system is identified by its simple yet sturdy structure and can occasionally reflect characteristics similar to the Brocade Weave.

## Tests and Exclusion Criteria

Each test conducted serves to eliminate certain currency systems based on the observed outcomes. The results of these tests provide an analytical framework for narrowing down which currency systems are not applicable.

### 1. Weave Pattern Analysis

- **Simple Pattern**: If a simple pattern is observed, rule out the following currency systems:
  - **Double Cloth Weave**
  - **Brocade Weave**
  
  The Leno Weave and Chevron Weave may still be considered as they are associated with complex patterns.

- **Complex Pattern**: When a complex pattern is detected, exclude:
  - **Leno Weave**

  The Chevron Weave, Brocade Weave, and Double Cloth Weave may still be considered.

### 2. Porosity Measurement

- **(0, 20)**: If porosity falls within this range, no currency systems are specifically excluded; all remain potential candidates.

- **(21, 50)**: No systems are specifically excluded; all remain potential candidates.

- **(51, 100)**: At this level of porosity, exclude:
  - **Leno Weave**

  The Chevron Weave, Brocade Weave, and Double Cloth Weave may still be considered.

### 3. Selvage Analysis

- **Standard Selvage**: When identified, no currency systems are specifically excluded; all remain potential candidates.

- **Lenape Selvage**: Detecting this implies exclusion of:
  - **Leno Weave**

  The Chevron Weave, Brocade Weave, and Double Cloth Weave may still be considered.

### 4. Sheerness Assessment

- **Opaque**: If an opaque characteristic is observed, exclude:
  - **Leno Weave**

  The Chevron Weave, Brocade Weave, and Double Cloth Weave may still be considered.

- **Sheer**: When sheer is identified, no systems are outright excluded, implying all could possibly be sheer under certain conditions or none are predominantly so.

### 5. Weave Density Measurement

- **(0, 20)**: If density corresponds to this range, exclude:
  - **Brocade Weave**

  The Chevron Weave, Double Cloth Weave, and Leno Weave may still be considered.

- **(21, 50)**: No specific exclusions; keep all systems in consideration.

- **(51, 100)**: Systems to be excluded include:
  - **Leno Weave**

  The Chevron Weave, Brocade Weave, and Double Cloth Weave may still be considered.

### 6. Fiber Content Examination

- **Cotton**: If composed of cotton, exclude:
  - **Brocade Weave**

  The Leno Weave, Chevron Weave, and Double Cloth Weave may still be considered.

- **Silk, Wool, Synthetic, Linen, Blend**: Currently, no exclusions are directly associated with these fiber content observations, leaving all systems as candidates unless otherwise indicated by more detailed analyses.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides a structured methodology for ruling out certain currency systems based on test outcomes, rather than directly confirming them. By adhering to this exclusion-based analysis, users can effectively narrow their focus to specific currency systems that best meet various qualificatory criteria without making premature conclusions on applicability.
