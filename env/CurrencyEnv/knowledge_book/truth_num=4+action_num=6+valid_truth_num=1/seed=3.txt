# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Trade Token Analysis Guidebook. This guide is designed to help you understand the interactions of different currency systems and the tests used to analyze them. By learning how to conduct various tests and understanding their outcomes, you will be able to make informed decisions about the relevancy of certain currency systems. Letâ€™s explore the currency systems, the tests, and their implications.

## Currency Systems

We will focus on four unique currency systems, each named after different weave patterns:

1. **Gauze Weave**: Known for its thin and lightweight characteristics.
2. **Georgette Weave**: Typically lightweight and slightly crinkled in texture.
3. **Canvas Weave**: Heavy-duty and durable, often used for robust applications.
4. **Seersucker Weave**: Recognized by its puckered and textured finish, providing a unique feel.

## Tests and Their Outcomes

Various tests are conducted to analyze and differentiate the properties of these currency systems. Each test provides specific outcomes that can help rule out certain systems, guiding you toward the most appropriate currencies for your needs.

### 1. Drapeability Test

This test measures how a fabric falls or drapes. Based on the outcomes:

- **High Drape**: Excludes **Canvas Weave**.
- **Low Drape**: Excludes **Georgette Weave** and **Gauze Weave**.

When performing this test, if you observe a high drape, you can rule out Canvas Weave from consideration. Conversely, a low drape will help exclude both Georgette Weave and Gauze Weave.

### 2. Elasticity Test

Elasticity measures the fabric's ability to stretch and return to its original shape. The outcomes define:

- **Elasticity Score 0 - 5**: No exclusions are made based on this range.
- **Elasticity Score 6 - 15**: No exclusions are made based on this range.
- **Elasticity Score 16 - 30**: Excludes **Seersucker Weave**.

When you record an elasticity score between 16 and 30, Seersucker Weave is ruled out as a potential currency.

### 3. Fabric Stiffness Test

This test assesses fabric stiffness, categorizing systems as follows:

- **Stiffness Score 0 - 5**: Excludes **Gauze Weave**.
- **Stiffness Score 6 - 15**: No exclusions are made based on this range.
- **Stiffness Score 16 - 30**: Excludes **Canvas Weave**.

A stiffness score below 6 rules out Gauze Weave, while a score above 15 eliminates Canvas Weave as a currency system option.

### 4. Weave Pattern Analysis

The complexity of the weave pattern is evaluated:

- **Simple Pattern**: No exclusions are made based on this pattern.
- **Complex Pattern**: Excludes **Canvas Weave** and **Gauze Weave**.

On finding a complex pattern, you can confidently eliminate both Canvas Weave and Gauze Weave.

### 5. Thickness Measurement

Thickness is paramount for numerous applications:

- **Thickness 0 - 0.5**: Excludes **Canvas Weave**.
- **Thickness 0.6 - 1.5**: No exclusions are made.
- **Thickness 1.6 - 5.0**: Excludes **Gauze Weave**.

A thin measurement of up to 0.5 rules out the Canvas Weave, while a thick measurement above 1.5 eliminates Gauze Weave.

### 6. Surface Texture Analysis

This analysis evaluates the texture of the fabric surface:

- **Smooth**: Excludes **Seersucker Weave**.
- **Textured**: No exclusions are made based on this texture.

If a smooth texture is identified, the Seersucker Weave is ruled out as a possibility.

## Conclusion

By carefully analyzing these tests and interpretations, you can make knowledgeable inferences about the suitability of various currency systems. Use this guide as your reference to streamline the decision-making process for your applications. Always remember that observing certain outcomes allows you to exclude some currency systems, thereby narrowing down the best fit for your needs.
