# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of the currency systems we are analyzing and testing, along with a structured approach to evaluating them. This includes an analysis of specific characteristics such as weave patterns, color fastness, thickness, selvage type, luster, and surface texture. The ultimate goal is to rule out incompatible currency systems based on the outcomes of each test.

## Currency Systems

1. **Piqué Weave**: Known for a textured surface, often used to create patterns and has a smooth texture.
2. **Velvet Weave**: Recognized for its rich texture and luxurious appearance, but it may have issues with color fastness and thickness.
3. **Damask Weave**: Features intricate designs and patterns, often noted for its low luster.
4. **Mock Leno Weave**: A type of weave that creates an open, lattice effect, with distinct selvage characteristics.

## Tests and Outcomes

### 1. Weave Pattern Analysis
- **Simple Pattern**: *Rule Out* - Damask Weave, Piqué Weave
  - When a simple pattern is observed, Damask Weave and Piqué Weave can be eliminated as possibilities since they are known for more complex design patterns.
  
- **Complex Pattern**: No currency systems are ruled out by complex patterns alone in this analysis.

### 2. Color Fastness Test
- **High Color Fastness**: No currency systems are ruled out by high color fastness.
- **Low Color Fastness**: *Rule Out* - Velvet Weave
  - If the fabric shows low color fastness, Velvet Weave is not considered due to its poor color retention properties.

### 3. Thickness Measurement
- **(0, 0.5) Range**: *Rule Out* - Velvet Weave
  - Any thickness measurement between 0 and 0.5 rules out Velvet Weave, as it is typically thicker.
  
- **(0.6, 1.5) and (1.6, 5.0) Ranges**: No currency systems are ruled out by these thickness ranges.

### 4. Selvage Analysis
- **Standard Selvage**: No currency systems are ruled out by standard selvage.
- **Lenape Selvage**: *Rule Out* - Mock Leno Weave
  - The presence of Lenape Selvage will rule out Mock Leno Weave due to its distinct selvage characteristics.

### 5. Luster Evaluation
- **High Luster**: No currency systems are ruled out by high luster.
- **Low Luster**: *Rule Out* - Damask Weave
  - A low luster outcome suggests ruling out Damask Weave due to its common low sheen.

### 6. Surface Texture Analysis
- **Smooth Surface**: *Rule Out* - Piqué Weave
  - If the surface texture is smooth, Piqué Weave can be ruled out due to its typical textured nature.
  
- **Textured Surface**: No currency systems are ruled out by a textured surface.

## Conclusion

Through detailed testing and evaluation using these defined tests and criteria, this guidebook aids in narrowing down the appropriate currency systems by ruling out those that do not meet the necessary attributes. This methodical approach ensures clarity and decisiveness in distinguishing among Piqué Weave, Velvet Weave, Damask Weave, and Mock Leno Weave.
