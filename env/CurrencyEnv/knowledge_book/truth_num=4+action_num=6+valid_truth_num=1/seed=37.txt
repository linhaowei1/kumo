# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to assist analysts in evaluating the four unique currency systems: Waffle Weave, Jacquard Weave, Dotted Swiss Weave, and Damask Weave. We will explore these systems through a series of tests designed to systematically eliminate options based on specific outcomes, thus narrowing down the possibilities to determine the most likely currency system.

## Currency Systems Overview

1. **Waffle Weave**: 
   - Known for its distinct texture and appearance, resembling a waffle pattern.
   - Often made from synthetic fibers.
   
2. **Jacquard Weave**: 
   - Characterized by intricate, complex patterns.
   - Typically woven on a jacquard loom, which allows for detailed designs.

3. **Dotted Swiss Weave**: 
   - Recognizable by its raised dots scattered across the fabric surface.
   - Commonly manufactured from wool.

4. **Damask Weave**: 
   - Features a reversible pattern, usually with floral or geometric designs.
   - Made from cotton and known for its smooth surface texture.

## Tests and Rule-out Analysis

### 1. Weave Pattern Analysis

- **Simple Pattern**: Performing this test and observing a simple pattern rules out Damask Weave and Jacquard Weave. Since Damask and Jacquard are known for complex patterns, a simple pattern excludes them from consideration.

- **Complex Pattern**: Cannot be observed to rule out any currency as no specific rule-out is defined for complex patterns.

### 2. Fiber Content Examination

- **Cotton**: Detecting cotton content rules out Damask Weave.
- **Silk**: Presence of silk does not rule out any studied currency systems as none are made from silk.
- **Wool**: Finding wool rules out Dotted Swiss Weave.
- **Synthetic**: Identifying synthetic fibers rules out Waffle Weave.
- **Linen**: Discovery of linen does not rule out any studied currency systems as none are made from linen.
- **Blend**: Observing a blend will not rule out any systems, as no blends are defined for exclusion.

### 3. Thread Count Measurement

- **(0, 100)**: A low thread count within this range rules out Damask Weave.
- **(101, 300)**: No currency systems are ruled out with a medium range thread count.
- **(301, 600)**: A high thread count measurement in this range rules out Waffle Weave.

### 4. Surface Texture Analysis

- **Smooth**: A smooth surface texture rules out Waffle Weave.
- **Textured**: Textured surfaces do not lead to a rule-out of any systems as none are specified.

### 5. Float Length Measurement

- **(0, 2)**: Short float lengths do not exclude any currency systems as none are specified.
- **(3, 5)**: Medium float lengths rule out no systems as none are defined.
- **(6, 10)**: Longer float lengths rule out Damask Weave.

### 6. Interlacing Frequency Check

- **(0, 50)**: A low interlacing frequency in this range rules out Damask Weave.
- **(51, 100)**: No currency systems are excluded under this interlacing frequency range.
- **(101, 200)**: A high interlacing frequency does not rule out any systems as no exclusions are provided.

## Conclusion

This guidebook represents a systematic approach to identifying potential currency systems by eliminating options through specific test outcomes. By understanding how these tests eliminate certain systems, analysts can more efficiently identify the actual currency system in question.

To effectively use this guide, perform each test in sequence and apply the exclusion criteria accordingly until further options are no longer plausible or to achieve the most probable system determination.
