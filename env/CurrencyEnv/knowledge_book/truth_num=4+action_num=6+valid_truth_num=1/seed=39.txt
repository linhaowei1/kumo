# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Trade Token Analysis Guidebook. This guide will walk you through the evaluation and elimination process of different currency systems based on specified tests and their outcomes. The primary goal of this guide is to help you understand which currency systems can be ruled out when specific test outcomes are observed. Here, we detail the currency systems and tests you will encounter.

## Currency Systems

The currency systems under consideration include:

1. **Herringbone Weave**: Known for a distinctive V-shaped pattern, this weave resembles a broken zigzag. It is typically used in fabrics requiring durability and structure.

2. **Rib Weave**: Recognized by its pronounced ribbed texture, this weave adds extra stretch and strength to fabrics. It is often used in apparel requiring comfort and flexibility.

3. **Crepe Weave**: Characterized by a crinkled or pebbled texture, achieved through yarn and weaving techniques. This weave contributes to an elegant drape and unique texture.

4. **Velveteen Weave**: Resembling velvet, this weave gives a soft, plush surface that is less lustrous. It is ideal for producing luxurious-feeling fabrics.

## Tests and Outcomes

The following tests allow for the exclusion of specific currency systems based on the observed outcomes. Remember, the focus is on ruling out possibilities rather than confirming them.

### 1. Fiber Content Examination

This test analyzes the fiber composition of the fabric.
- **Cotton, Silk, Synthetic, Blend**: No exclusions apply to these fibers.
- **Wool**: Excludes **Velveteen Weave**.
- **Linen**: Excludes **Velveteen Weave**.

### 2. Yarn Twist Direction Test

This test determines the twist direction of the yarn used in the fabric.
- **S-Twist**: Excludes **Herringbone Weave**.
- **Z-Twist**: No exclusions apply.

### 3. Elasticity Test

This test measures the fabric’s ability to stretch.
- **0 to 5% Elasticity**: No exclusions apply.
- **6 to 15% Elasticity**: No exclusions apply.
- **16 to 30% Elasticity**: Excludes **Crepe Weave**.

### 4. Stretch Recovery Test

This test evaluates the ability of the fabric to return to its original shape after being stretched.
- **0 to 50% Recovery**: Excludes **Crepe Weave**.
- **51 to 100% Recovery**: No exclusions apply.

### 5. Pilling Resistance Test

This test assesses the fabric’s resistance to forming small, fuzzy balls on the surface.
- **High Resistance**: No exclusions apply.
- **Low Resistance**: Excludes **Velveteen Weave**.

### 6. Weft and Warp Count Analysis

This test examines the thread count in the weft and warp directions.
- **1x1 Count**: No exclusions apply.
- **2x1 Count**: Excludes **Rib Weave**.
- **3x1 Count**: No exclusions apply.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a structured approach to exclude certain currency systems when specific test outcomes are observed. By carefully interpreting each test's results, the possibilities can be narrowed down, thus simplifying the selection or evaluation of the desired weave type. Use this guide to enhance your understanding and application of currency systems in trade token analysis.
