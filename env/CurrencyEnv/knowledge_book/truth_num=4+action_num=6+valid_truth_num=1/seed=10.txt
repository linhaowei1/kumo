# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook: Currency Systems and Testing

Welcome to the Trade Token Analysis Guidebook, designed to help you understand various fabric currency systems through a series of textile tests. This guide provides insights into specific currency systems and the outcomes of respective tests that can help you rule out certain possibilities based on observable textile characteristics.

## Currency Systems Overview

1. **Cloqué Weave**: Known for its textured, puckered surface, often used in garments and upholstery. This weave is less likely to include certain fibers after test results.

2. **Corduroy Weave**: Characterized by its ribbed texture, popular in casual and durable clothing. The weft and warp count provides important exclusion criteria for this system.

3. **Poplin Weave**: Distinguished by its fine, closely woven characteristics, making it a versatile fabric often used in shirts and dresses. It provides several exclusion clues across tests.

4. **Chevron Weave**: Recognized by its zigzag pattern, which adds visual interest and texture. Yarn twist direction is a key test related to this weave.

## Textile Tests and Analysis

### 1. Fiber Content Examination

This test identifies the fiber composition of the fabric, which can rule out specific currency systems:

- **Cotton**: Rule out **Cloqué Weave**.
- **Silk**: Rule out **Poplin Weave**.
- **Wool**: No currency systems are ruled out.
- **Synthetic**: No currency systems are ruled out.
- **Linen**: Rule out **Corduroy Weave**.
- **Blend**: Rule out **Poplin Weave**.

### 2. Yarn Twist Direction Test

This test examines the yarn's twist, either S-twist or Z-twist, and each result can eliminate certain weaves:

- **S-Twist**: Rule out **Chevron Weave**.
- **Z-Twist**: Rule out **Poplin Weave**.

### 3. Finish Treatment Detection

This examines finishes applied to the fabric:

- **Mercerized**: Rule out **Poplin Weave**.
- **Sanforized**: No currency systems are ruled out.

### 4. Weft and Warp Count Analysis

This looks at the density of the weave by analyzing thread counts:

- **(1, 1) Count**: Rule out **Poplin Weave**.
- **(2, 1) Count**: No currency systems are ruled out.
- **(3, 1) Count**: Rule out **Corduroy Weave**.

### 5. Surface Reflectivity Test

Measures the fabric's reflective quality:

- **High Reflectivity**: No currency systems are ruled out.
- **Low Reflectivity**: Rule out **Poplin Weave**.

### 6. Snag Resistance Test

Assesses the fabric's ability to resist pulls and snags:

- **High Resistance**: Rule out **Poplin Weave**.
- **Low Resistance**: No currency systems are ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guidebook aids in systematically ruling out currency systems based on observable test outcomes, ensuring a precise and comprehensive approach to fabric analysis. By carefully interpreting these results, you can efficiently narrow down the possibilities and identify the appropriate currency system for your needs.
