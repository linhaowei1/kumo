# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

In the realm of textile analysis, various currency systems, sometimes referred to by their weave structures, are employed. Understanding these systems and the tests that distinguish them is critical for accurate fabric identification and application. This guidebook introduces the currency systems 'Point Twill Weave,' 'Ottoman Weave,' 'Gabardine Weave,' and 'Satin Weave,' alongside specific tests designed to rule out incompatible weaves based on their unique characteristics.

### Currency Systems

1. **Point Twill Weave**
   - Known for its diagonal parallel ribs.
   - Each line of ribbing has a unique appearance and orientation, providing strength and a distinctive visual texture.

2. **Ottoman Weave**
   - Features pronounced ribbing and elevated, horizontal bars.
   - Typically used in heavy, durable fabrics for its unique texture and enhanced durability.

3. **Gabardine Weave**
   - Notable for its tight, compact weave and diagonal twill lines.
   - Known for its durability and water-resistant capabilities, making it ideal for outerwear.

4. **Satin Weave**
   - Characterized by its lustrous, smooth finish achieved by allowing more floats (threads) on the surface.
   - Widely used for its sheen and luxurious feel, commonly in fashion and luxury items.

### Tests and Outcomes

#### 1. Yarn Twist Direction Test
Assesses the direction in which yarns are twisted ('S-Twist' or 'Z-Twist').

- **S-Twist:**
  - Rule Out: 'Point Twill Weave'

- **Z-Twist:**
  - Rule Out: None (no specific configurations lead to eliminating the available currency systems)

#### 2. Fabric Stiffness Test
Measures the rigidity of the fabric within a defined scale, essential for determining suitability for various applications.

- **Stiffness Range (0, 5):**
  - Rule Out: None

- **Stiffness Range (6, 15):**
  - Rule Out: None

- **Stiffness Range (16, 30):**
  - Rule Out: 'Gabardine Weave'

#### 3. Surface Reflectivity Test
Evaluates the level of light reflection, distinguishing between high and low sheen fabrics.

- **High Reflectivity:**
  - Rule Out: 'Satin Weave'

- **Low Reflectivity:**
  - Rule Out: None

#### 4. Moisture Absorption Test
Determines the fabric's capacity to absorb moisture, a critical property for performance fabrics.

- **Absorption Range (0, 10):**
  - Rule Out: 'Satin Weave'

- **Absorption Range (11, 30):**
  - Rule Out: None

- **Absorption Range (31, 100):**
  - Rule Out: None

#### 5. Interlacing Frequency Check
Assesses the density of interlacings in the fabric structure, aiding in identifying fabric types based on their weave tightness.

- **Frequency Range (0, 50):**
  - Rule Out: 'Satin Weave'

- **Frequency Range (51, 100):**
  - Rule Out: None

- **Frequency Range (101, 200):**
  - Rule Out: None

#### 6. Fiber Content Examination
Investigates the material composition of the fabric, important for determining its use case and performance.

- **Cotton:**
  - Rule Out: 'Satin Weave'

- **Silk:**
  - Rule Out: None

- **Wool:**
  - Rule Out: 'Satin Weave'

- **Synthetic:**
  - Rule Out: None

- **Linen:**
  - Rule Out: 'Satin Weave'

- **Blend:**
  - Rule Out: None

### Conclusion

This guide serves as a comprehensive tool for evaluating fabric weave types using a series of standardized tests. By systematically ruling out weave types based on the test outcomes, professionals can make informed decisions about fabric selection and application tailored to specific requirements. Understanding these nuances ensures accurate identification and optimal utilization of textile materials.
