# Trade Token Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Trade Token Analysis Guidebook. This guide is designed to help you understand and analyze different currency systems through a series of structured tests. Each test provides insights into the characteristics of the currency systems, allowing certain systems to be ruled out based on the observed outcomes.

## Currency Systems

The currency systems under analysis are:

- **Ottoman Weave**: Known for its distinct texture and design, often featuring a pronounced horizontal rib.
- **Matelassé Weave**: Characterized by a quilted appearance, offering a textured, raised pattern that is both durable and attractive.
- **Seersucker Weave**: Recognized for its alternating smooth and puckered textures, ideal for lightweight and breathable applications.
- **Canvas Weave**: A robust and heavy-duty weave, commonly used for its strength and durability.

## Tests and Analysis

In this guide, we will explore various tests designed to highlight the unique properties of each weave. The outcomes of these tests will help rule out certain currency systems based on the observations.

### 1. Weave Pattern Analysis

This test examines the complexity of the weave pattern.

- **Simple Pattern**: If a simple pattern is observed, **Matelassé Weave** is ruled out.
- **Complex Pattern**: If a complex pattern is observed, **Canvas Weave** is ruled out.

### 2. Abrasion Resistance Test

This assesses the durability of the weave under wear and friction.

- **(0, 1000) Abrasions**: No systems are ruled out.
- **(1001, 5000) Abrasions**: No systems are ruled out.
- **(5001, 10000) Abrasions**: If the weave withstands this range, **Canvas Weave** is ruled out.

### 3. Weft and Warp Count Analysis

This test evaluates the density and ratio of weft and warp threads.

- **(1, 1) Count**: No systems are ruled out.
- **(2, 1) Count**: If this ratio is present, **Ottoman Weave** is ruled out.
- **(3, 1) Count**: No systems are ruled out.

### 4. Pilling Resistance Test

This determines the fabric's resistance to forming small balls of fiber.

- **High Resistance**: If high resistance to pilling is shown, **Canvas Weave** is ruled out.
- **Low Resistance**: No systems are ruled out.

### 5. Porosity Measurement

This test measures the openness and air permeability of the weave.

- **(0, 20) Porosity**: If the porosity falls in this range, **Canvas Weave** is ruled out.
- **(21, 50) Porosity**: No systems are ruled out.
- **(51, 100) Porosity**: No systems are ruled out.

### 6. Fabric Weight Measurement

This assesses the heaviness or lightness of the fabric.

- **(0, 150) gm/m²**: If the fabric weight is in this range, **Canvas Weave** is ruled out.
- **(151, 300) gm/m²**: No systems are ruled out.
- **(301, 600) gm/m²**: No systems are ruled out.

## Conclusion

Through careful application of these tests, analysts can systematically rule out currency systems that do not match certain criteria, narrowing down the possibilities based on detailed outcomes. This structured approach ensures a comprehensive analysis, aiding in the accurate identification of the most appropriate currency system for specific needs.
