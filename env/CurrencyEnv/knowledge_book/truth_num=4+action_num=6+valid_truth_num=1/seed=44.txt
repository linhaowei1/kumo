## **Trade Token Analysis Guidebook**

Welcome to the Trade Token Analysis Guidebook, your comprehensive resource for understanding the nuances and intricacies of various currency systems and tests used in textile analysis. This guide aims to provide a clear and straightforward overview of the different currency systems and the specific tests used to evaluate their properties. Furthermore, it explains how specific outcomes from these tests help rule out certain currency systems, aiding in accurate identification and classification.

## Currency Systems

1. **Sheer Weave:** 
   - Known for its lightweight and translucent qualities, sheer weave is often used in applications where delicate and airy fabrics are desired.

2. **Dobby Weave:**
   - Characterized by small geometric patterns woven into the fabric, dobby weave is versatile and typically used in both fashion and furnishing applications.

3. **Canvas Weave:**
   - Recognized for its sturdiness, canvas weave is a thick, heavy-duty fabric ideal for making items that require durability, such as tote bags and work apparel.

4. **Brocade Weave:**
   - Luxurious and decorative, brocade weave incorporates rich textures and intricate patterns, often used in high-end textile applications and upholstery.

## Tests and Their Outcomes

The tests outlined below assess various properties of the above currency systems. Importantly, the outcomes determine which currency systems must be excluded from consideration in specific contexts.

1. **Color Fastness Test:**
   - **High Color Fastness:** All currency systems are included when high color fastness is observed.  
   - **Low Color Fastness:** If low color fastness is observed, **Brocade Weave** should be ruled out because it does not meet the required standards for this outcome.

2. **Pilling Resistance Test:**
   - **High Resistance:** If high resistance is observed, **Canvas Weave** should be ruled out because it does not meet the required standards for this outcome.
   - **Low Resistance:** Regardless of the outcome, no currency systems are specifically ruled out in this test.

3. **Abrasion Resistance Test:**
   - Ranges for Abrasion Resistance:
     - **(0, 1000):** Excludes **Sheer Weave** because it tends to show low performance in this segment.
     - **(1001, 5000):** No exclusions, allowing all currency systems to be considered. 
     - **(5001, 10000):** **Canvas Weave** is ruled out under these conditions as it outperforms this range.

4. **Fabric Weight Measurement:**
   - Weight Ranges:
     - **(0, 150):** Excludes **Canvas Weave** due to its heavier weight.
     - **(151, 300):** No exclusions are made, suitable for a wide range of currencies.
     - **(301, 600):** Excludes **Sheer Weave** given its typically lightweight nature.

5. **Porosity Measurement:**
   - Porosity Ranges:
     - **(0, 20):** Excludes **Canvas Weave** as it indicates low porosity uncommon to its typical structure.
     - **(21, 50):** All currencies can be considered as no exclusions apply here.
     - **(51, 100):** Rules out **Sheer Weave** which shows higher porosity in large-scale applications.

6. **Thickness Measurement:**
   - Thickness Ranges:
     - **(0, 0.5):** Excludes **Canvas Weave** due to its generally thicker constancy.
     - **(0.6, 1.5):** No specific currency systems are ruled out, maintaining versatility.
     - **(1.6, 5.0):** **Sheer Weave** is excluded as it does not fit within this thicker range.

By closely following the outcomes of these tests and applying the rule-out criteria, stakeholders can more effectively narrow down possibilities and make informed decisions regarding the suitability of different currency systems in various contexts. This methodical approach ensures precision and reliability in textile evaluation and classification.
