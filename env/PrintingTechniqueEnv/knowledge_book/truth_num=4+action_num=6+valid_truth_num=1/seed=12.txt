# Guidebook on Printing Techniques and Examinations

This guidebook aims to introduce various printing techniques and outline the examinations used to differentiate them based on certain outcomes. By understanding these techniques and how they interact with specific tests, one can effectively determine which techniques are not applicable under certain observed conditions.

## Printing Techniques Overview

1. **Nanography**: A modern printing technique that uses water-based nanographic inks suitable for a variety of substrates. Known for its vivid hues and environmental advantages, nanography is a versatile method marking a significant shift in the printing industry.

2. **Rotogravure**: A high-speed, high-quality printing process using engraved cylinders to transfer ink to paper, commonly used for productions like magazines, packaging, and wallpapers.

3. **Laser Printing**: A digital printing process where a laser beam projects an image onto an electrically charged drum, delivering exact and clean prints often used for documents and short-run publications.

4. **Linotype Printing**: An older printing method involving a machine that casts type metal into lines to create text, primarily used in newspaper production in the early 20th century.

## Examination Techniques and Outcomes

Examinations are essential in assessing printed materials to determine the likely print process or exclude others based on specific results:

### 1. Ink Composition Test

- **High Metal Content**: No exclusionary rules are associated directly with any technique.
  
- **Organic Pigments Detected**: This outcome excludes **Rotogravure** as a possible technique.
  
- **Presence of Soot-based Ink**: Observing this state rules out **Laser Printing** and **Nanography**.
  
- **Synthetic Dyes Present**: No techniques are excluded when synthetic dyes are detected.

### 2. Paper Fiber Analysis

- **High Cotton Content**: Excludes **Laser Printing**.
  
- **Wood Pulp Fibers**: There are no exclusionary rules for techniques associated with wood pulp fibers.
  
- **Hemp Fibers**: If hemp fibers are found, **Laser Printing** is ruled out.
  
- **Rice Straw Fibers**: The presence of rice straw fibers excludes **Linotype Printing**.

### 3. UV Light Examination

- **Fluorescence Detected**: No techniques are ruled out with this observation.
  
- **No Fluorescence**: When no fluorescence is detected, **Laser Printing** is excluded.
  
- **Phosphorescence Observed**: No exclusionary rules apply.
  
- **Dull Appearance**: This outcome does not exclude any techniques.

### 4. Printing Pattern Examination

- **Linear Patterns**: No techniques are excluded from consideration.
  
- **Dot Matrix Pattern**: When this pattern is observed, **Linotype Printing** is excluded.
  
- **No Discernible Pattern**: If no discernible pattern is noted, rule out **Laser Printing**.
  
- **Mesh-Based Patterns**: There are no techniques eliminated.

### 5. Paper Thickness Measurement

- **(0.0, 0.1)**: If the paper thickness falls within this range, **Laser Printing** is excluded.
  
- **(0.1, 0.2)**, **(0.2, 0.3)**, and **(0.3, 1.0)**: There are no printing techniques eliminated within these ranges.

### 6. Infrared Spectroscopy

- **High Infrared Absorption**: Detecting this level indicates that **Laser Printing** can be ruled out.
  
- **Low Infrared Absorption**: There are no exclusionary rules.
  
- **Distinct Absorption Lines**: With distinct absorption lines, **Rotogravure** is excluded as a technique.
  
- **Broad Absorption Spectrum**: No specific exclusions apply.

This structured approach using various examinations helps in systematically ruling out certain printing techniques, facilitating accurate identification of methods used in unknown print samples. By understanding these outcomes, one can better narrow down the possible techniques used in a given context.
