# Guidebook for Printing Techniques and Examination Analysis

## Introduction
The purpose of this guidebook is to help you understand and analyze various printing techniques using specific examinations. By understanding how different outcomes of these tests can exclude certain printing techniques, you can effectively narrow down the possible techniques used in your sample.

## Printing Techniques
1. **Nanography**: This is a cutting-edge digital printing technology known for using water-based nano inks. It is beneficial for high-speed, high-quality color printing.

2. **Rotogravure**: A traditional printing method valued for its ability to print high-quality images. It involves engraving the image onto a cylinder, which then presses the ink onto the substrate.

3. **Inkjet Printing**: A versatile and commonly used method, inkjet printing sprays droplets of ink onto paper to create images and text. It is widely used in home printers and commercial applications.

4. **Collotype**: A historical printing process that produces images with continuous tones from photographs, popular for fine art prints and postcards.

## Examinations and Outcomes

Each examination can reveal specific outcomes that rule out certain printing techniques, helping you identify the technique used for your sample.

### 1. Paper Fiber Analysis
This test identifies the types of fibers present in paper, which can signal what kind of printing is feasible.

- **High Cotton Content**: Rules out **Inkjet Printing**.
- **Hemp Fibers**: Rules out **Inkjet Printing**.
- **Wood Pulp Fibers**: No techniques are ruled out.
- **Rice Straw Fibers**: No techniques are ruled out.

### 2. Watermark Detection
This examination checks for watermarks in the paper, which can vary from simple marks to complex patterns or countermarks.

- **No Watermark**: No techniques are ruled out.
- **Simple Watermark**: Rules out **Inkjet Printing**.
- **Complex Watermark**: No techniques are ruled out.
- **Countermark Present**: Rules out **Rotogravure** and **Collotype**.

### 3. Ink Composition Test
By analyzing the ink's composition, we can determine which printing techniques are unlikely.

- **High Metal Content**: Rules out **Inkjet Printing**.
- **Organic Pigments Detected**: Rules out **Rotogravure**.
- **Presence of Soot-based Ink**: Rules out **Nanography**.
- **Synthetic Dyes Present**: No techniques are ruled out.

### 4. Paper Thickness Measurement
This test measures the thickness of the paper, excluding specific techniques based on compatibility with paper stock.

- **(0.0, 0.1) mm**: Rules out **Inkjet Printing**.
- **(0.1, 0.2) mm**: No techniques are ruled out.
- **(0.2, 0.3) mm**: No techniques are ruled out.
- **(0.3, 1.0) mm**: No techniques are ruled out.

### 5. Infrared Spectroscopy
This examination involves scanning the sample with infrared light and analyzing the absorption patterns.

- **High Infrared Absorption**: No techniques are ruled out.
- **Low Infrared Absorption**: No techniques are ruled out.
- **Distinct Absorption Lines**: Rules out **Rotogravure** and **Inkjet Printing**.
- **Broad Absorption Spectrum**: No techniques are ruled out.

### 6. Printing Pattern Examination
This test looks at the pattern or texture of the print, providing clues about the technology used.

- **Linear Patterns**: No techniques are ruled out.
- **Dot Matrix Pattern**: No techniques are ruled out.
- **No Discernible Pattern**: Rules out **Inkjet Printing**.
- **Mesh-Based Patterns**: No techniques are ruled out.

## Conclusion
By understanding the outcomes of these examinations and the techniques they exclude, you can systematically reduce the possibilities and make an informed determination of the printing technique used. This analytical approach ensures precision and accuracy in the evaluation of printed materials.
