## Renewable Energy Technologies

### 1. Geothermal Heat Pumps
Geothermal heat pumps exploit the stable temperature below the earth’s surface to provide heating, cooling, and hot water. This technology is most effective where soil and ground conditions support efficient heat exchange.

### 2. Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting
Piezoelectric energy harvesting involves converting mechanical strain from movements like foot traffic or vehicle passage into electrical energy. This technology can be incorporated in urban areas or transport infrastructure to harness energy from regular activities.

### 3. Active Solar Thermal
Active solar thermal systems capture sunlight to produce heat, which is then used for water heating, space heating, or powering cooling systems. They are effective in regions with high solar irradiance.

### 4. Geothermal Energy (High Temperature)
High-temperature geothermal energy is harnessed from heat stored deep within the earth. It's used to generate electricity and is suitable for areas with significant geothermal activity.

## Assessment Methods

### 1. Solar Irradiance Measurement
Measures the solar power available at a location. This method determines the feasibility of solar technologies.

**Exclusion Criteria:**  
- Solar irradiance between 0-3 kWh/m²/day rules out Active Solar Thermal applications.

### 2. Geothermal Gradient Measurement
Used to evaluate the increase in temperature with depth below the Earth's surface. These measurements help identify suitable locations for geothermal technologies.

**Exclusion Criteria:**  
- Geothermal gradients of 0-30°C/km eliminate the possibility of using Geothermal Energy (High Temperature).

### 3. Soil Quality Test
Assesses the composition and characteristics of the soil, impacting underground installations like geothermal heat pumps.

**Exclusion Criteria:**  
- Poor soil quality rules out Geothermal Heat Pumps.

### 4. Land Availability Assessment
Evaluates whether sufficient land is available for deploying energy technologies, especially those requiring significant space.

**Exclusion Criteria:**  
- Limited land availability rules out Geothermal Energy (High Temperature) due to its spatial requirements.

### 5. Renewable Energy Resource Map Analysis
Analyzes maps that indicate the availability and intensity of renewable energy resources, aiding in the determination of site potential.

**Exclusion Criteria:**  
- Low potential areas rule out Geothermal Energy (High Temperature).

### 6. Proximity to Grid Survey
Assesses the distance to existing electrical infrastructure, which affects the viability of energy projects due to transmission costs and losses.

**Exclusion Criteria:**  
- Areas 50-1000 km away from the grid eliminate Geothermal Energy (High Temperature) due to high transmission costs.
