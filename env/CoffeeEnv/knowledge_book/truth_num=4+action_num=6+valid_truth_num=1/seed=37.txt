# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Analysis Guidebook! This guide will introduce you to several popular coffee bean varieties and outline the testing methods commonly used to assess their characteristics. Our primary focus will be on how specific test outcomes can exclude certain varieties from consideration. Let’s dive into the details of our coffee bean varieties and the associated testing methodologies.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

1. **Caturra**: This is a natural mutation of the Bourbon variety, known for its small size and vibrant acidity. It often offers a bright and clean cup of coffee with citrus and floral notes.

2. **Kouillou**: Also known as Robusta, this variety is robust with a strong and often bitter flavor profile. It is generally higher in caffeine content compared to Arabica varieties.

3. **Maragogype**: Known as the "Elephant Bean" due to its large size, Maragogype provides a mild flavor with bright acidity. It’s a variant of the Typica lineage and is less common in mainstream coffee production.

4. **SL28**: Originating from Kenya, this variety is revered for its complex acidity and flavors that often mimic blackcurrant and citrus. It’s a part of the Bourbon lineage, adapted for drought resistance.

## Testing Methods

### 1. Caffeine Content Analysis
Caffeine content analysis measures the caffeine levels within coffee beans, which can help distinguish between varieties known for high or low caffeine levels.

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs**:
  - If caffeine content falls between 0.8 to 1.2 or 1.2 to 1.6, **Kouillou** is ruled out as it usually has higher caffeine content.
  - If caffeine content ranges from 1.6 to 2.2, **Caturra** and **SL28** are excluded since these ranges align more closely with their profiles.

### 2. Aroma Profile Evaluation
This test involves assessing the aroma profile, which can be floral, fruity, earthy, woody, nutty, or chocolatey, to help identify or rule out specific varieties.

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs**:
  - An earthy and woody aroma excludes **SL28** as it’s not typically associated with such a profile.

### 3. Bean Size Measurement
This method measures the size of coffee beans, which can vary significantly between varieties.

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs**:
  - Bean sizes between 7.0 to 8.0 or 8.0 to 9.5 mm rule out **Maragogype** due to their usually larger size.
  - Sizes from 9.5 to 12.0 mm exclude **Caturra** since this variety is usually smaller.

### 4. DNA Fingerprinting
This advanced test distinguishes coffee varieties at a genetic level, looking for markers specific to each type.

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs**:
  - Membership in **Group C** excludes **Maragogype**, which aligns with its unique genetic markers.

### 5. Acidity Test
Acidity tests determine the pH levels of brewed coffee, revealing insights into the perceived brightness or sharpness of a coffee.

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs**:
  - A pH level between 4.0 and 5.0 excludes **SL28**, known for higher acidity not typically common in this range.

### 6. Oil Content Analysis
Analysis of oil content can impact the flavor and mouthfeel of the coffee brew.

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs**:
  - Oil content results from 9.0 to 12.0, 12.0 to 15.0, and 15.0 to 17.0 do not allow any specific exclusions due to the varied nature of oil content across all varieties in our selection.

## Conclusion

This guidebook offers clarity on how different outcomes of testing methods can be used to exclude specific coffee bean varieties. Understanding these relationships helps in narrowing down the identification of coffee types based on their physical and chemical characteristics. Enjoy your journey into the flavorful world of coffee analysis!
