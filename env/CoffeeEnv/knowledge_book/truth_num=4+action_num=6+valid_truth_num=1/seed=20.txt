# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Analysis Guidebook, where we explore the delightful world of coffee through the lens of various bean varieties and testing methods. This guide will give you a comprehensive understanding of four distinct coffee bean varieties and the testing methods used to analyze them. Additionally, you'll learn how certain outcomes from these tests can help eliminate specific types of beans, aiding in the identification process.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

1. **Mocha**: Known for its rich, chocolatey flavor, Mocha beans are generally larger and are often cherished for their aromatic qualities. They have a distinct profile that stands out in many coffee blends.

2. **Caturra**: This variety is a mutation of the Bourbon coffee bean, offering a bright acidity and a complex flavor profile. Caturra beans are smaller and have a lively, refreshing taste often sought after in specialty coffee markets.

3. **Sarchimor**: Sarchimor beans are hybrids known for their disease resistance and good yield. They tend to have a balanced flavor profile with medium acidity, making them a versatile choice for many coffee enthusiasts.

4. **Java Robusta**: Java Robusta beans are robust and known for their higher caffeine content. They have a strong, earthy flavor and are often used in blends to provide body and richness.

## Testing Methods

Understanding the characteristics of different coffee beans involves various testing methods. Below are the testing methods used to analyze coffee beans and the outcomes that could help exclude certain varieties:

1. **Acidity Test**
   - This test measures the acidity level of coffee beans, which influences their taste profile. 
   - Outcomes:
     - When the acidity level is between 6.0 and 7.0, Sarchimor is excluded.
     - Acidity levels between 5.0 and 6.0, and 4.0 and 5.0 do not rule out any specific variety.

2. **Caffeine Content Analysis**
   - Analyzing caffeine content is crucial for understanding the strength and stimulating effects of coffee.
   - Outcomes:
     - Caffeine levels between 0.8 and 1.2 and 1.2 and 1.6 rule out Java Robusta.
     - Levels between 1.6 and 2.2 rule out Caturra.

3. **Bean Size Measurement**
   - This test helps in identifying bean varieties based on size.
   - Outcomes:
     - Bean sizes between 8.0 and 9.5 rule out Mocha.
     - Bean sizes between 9.5 and 12.0 rule out both Mocha and Caturra.

4. **Aroma Profile Evaluation**
   - Aroma is a significant aspect of coffee and can help identify different varieties.
   - Outcomes:
     - A floral and fruity aroma profile rules out Java Robusta.
     - Earthy and woody, nutty and chocolatey aromas donâ€™t specifically exclude any variety.

5. **Oil Content Analysis**
   - This test measures the oil content in beans, impacting flavor and mouthfeel.
   - Outcomes:
     - Oil content between 15.0 and 17.0, 12.0 and 15.0, and 9.0 and 12.0 do not exclude any specific variety.

6. **DNA Fingerprinting**
   - Enables precise identification of coffee bean varieties through genetic analysis.
   - Outcomes:
     - DNA fingerprints classified into Groups A, B, and C do not exclude any specific varieties based on this dataset.

By understanding these varieties and conducting specific tests, coffee professionals can narrow down the possibilities and identify unique coffee beans through a process of elimination based on test outcomes. This methodical approach ensures the best selection and knowledge of coffee varieties, enhancing both appreciation and enjoyment.
