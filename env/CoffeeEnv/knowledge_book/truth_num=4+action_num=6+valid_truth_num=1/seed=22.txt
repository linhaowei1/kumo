# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the definitive guide to understanding coffee bean varieties and testing methods. This guide will introduce you to four distinct coffee bean varieties and various testing methods used to evaluate them. It is designed to be straightforward, focusing on how specific outcomes from each test can exclude or rule out certain coffee bean varieties. Let's dive in.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

### 1. Typica
Typica is one of the most widely recognized varieties of coffee beans. Known for its excellent cup quality, usually exhibiting a balanced flavor profile with sweet and floral notes.

### 2. Arabica
Arabica beans are the most popular and widely cultivated coffee species, making up the majority of global coffee production. These beans are known for their smooth, complex flavor and aroma characteristics, often with higher acidity compared to other varieties.

### 3. Sidamo
Named after the Sidamo region in Ethiopia, these beans are celebrated for their unique flavors. They typically possess earthy and woody notes, offering a full-bodied cup that stands out from more traditional coffee profiles.

### 4. Kouillou
Kouillou beans, usually referred to within the context of Robusta beans, are known for their higher caffeine content compared to Arabica. They often produce a more robust and less acidic coffee.

## Testing Methods and Analysis

### 1. Caffeine Content Analysis
This test measures the caffeine concentration in coffee beans, which can help narrow down the variety.

- **Outcome: (0.8, 1.2) or (1.2, 1.6)**  
  If the caffeine content falls within these ranges, the Kouillou variety is ruled out.

- **Outcome: (1.6, 2.2)**  
  A higher caffeine content in this range eliminates Arabica and Typica varieties, suggesting other possible varieties.

### 2. Aroma Profile Evaluation
Aroma profile analysis identifies specific scent notes in coffee, helping to exclude certain varieties.

- **Outcome: Floral and Fruity**  
  No specific varieties are ruled out.

- **Outcome: Earthy and Woody**  
  This outcome indicates the presence of attributes typical of Sidamo, eliminating Sidamo from consideration under these conditions.

- **Outcome: Nutty and Chocolatey**  
  There are no specific exclusions for this aroma profile.

### 3. Acidity Test
Testing the acidity level of coffee can highlight characteristics associated with certain varieties.

- **Outcome: (6.0, 7.0)**  
  At this acidity level, no varieties are specifically ruled out.

- **Outcome: (5.0, 6.0)**  
  Similarly, no varieties are ruled out under these acidity conditions.

- **Outcome: (4.0, 5.0)**  
  A lower acidity points away from Arabica, ruling out this variety as a possibility.

### 4. DNA Fingerprinting
This method involves analyzing the genetic makeup of the coffee beans to determine their variety.

- **Outcome: Group A**  
  No exclusions based on this outcome.

- **Outcome: Group B**  
  This genetic grouping rules out Arabica beans.

- **Outcome: Group C**  
  Likewise, no specific exclusions apply.

### 5. Oil Content Analysis
This analysis measures the oil present in coffee beans, which can influence flavor and freshness.

- **Outcome: (15.0, 17.0) or (12.0, 15.0) or (9.0, 12.0)**  
  Currently, these outcomes do not exclude any varieties.

### 6. Bean Size Measurement
Bean size can vary significantly across different coffee bean varieties, impacting the roasting process and flavor release.

- **Outcome: (7.0, 8.0) or (8.0, 9.5) or (9.5, 12.0)**  
  None of these measurements specifically rule out any coffee bean varieties.

In conclusion, this guide presents a comprehensive overview of how different testing outcomes can be used to exclude certain coffee bean varieties. Understanding these methods and their results is crucial for distinguishing between coffee types and achieving a desired coffee experience.
