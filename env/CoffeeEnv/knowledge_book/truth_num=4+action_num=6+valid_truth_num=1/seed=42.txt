# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Analysis Guidebook, your comprehensive resource for understanding different coffee bean varieties and the methods used to evaluate them. This guide focuses on four popular varieties: Geisha, Yirgacheffe, Sidamo, and Mocha. We'll also introduce six testing methods often employed to assess coffee beans, explaining how the outcomes of these tests can help identify—or rule out—certain coffee varieties.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

### Geisha
Known for its delicate floral aroma and vibrant acidity, Geisha is a favorite among coffee connoisseurs. This variety is renowned for its exceptional quality and unique flavor profile.

### Yirgacheffe
Originating from Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe beans are celebrated for their captivating floral and fruity notes. They offer a bright and lively cup, making them highly sought after.

### Sidamo
Sidamo, also hailing from Ethiopia, is famous for its full body and complex flavors. It often presents earthy and woody aromas, with a rich and smooth taste.

### Mocha
Mocha beans, often linked to Yemen, are distinguished by their small size and intense chocolatey flavors. They provide a unique and robust coffee experience.

## Testing Methods and Outcomes

### 1. Acidity Test
This test measures the acidity level in coffee, crucial for understanding its taste profile.

- **Outcome 4.0 - 5.0**: Rule out Geisha and Yirgacheffe. When acidity falls in this range, neither Geisha nor Yirgacheffe are present.

- **Other Outcomes (5.0 - 7.0)**: No exclusions, so any varietal might still be considered.

### 2. Bean Size Measurement
Bean size can influence the roasting process and the resulting flavor.

- **Outcome 8.0 - 12.0**: Eliminate Mocha. If the bean size is within this range, Mocha is not included because it typically falls outside this size range.

- **Other Outcomes (7.0 - 8.0)**: No exclusions apply.

### 3. DNA Fingerprinting
This method helps identify genetic characteristics of coffee beans.

- **Outcome Group B**: Exclude Geisha and Yirgacheffe. The presence of these varietals is ruled out in Group B based on genetic markers.

- **Other Groups (A, C)**: No varieties are ruled out.

### 4. Caffeine Content Analysis
Understanding the caffeine content is vital for flavor and strength profiles.

- **Outcome 1.6 - 2.2**: Rule out Geisha. Geisha does not fall within this caffeine content range.

- **Other Outcomes (0.8 - 1.6)**: No immediate exclusions.

### 5. Aroma Profile Evaluation
Aroma is a key factor in the coffee experience.

- **Outcome Earthy and Woody**: Rule out Sidamo, Geisha, and Yirgacheffe. If these aromas are detected, all three varieties are ruled out.

- **Outcome Nutty and Chocolatey**: Exclude Geisha and Yirgacheffe. These aromas rule out these varieties.

- **Other Profiles (Floral and Fruity)**: No exclusions are made.

### 6. Oil Content Analysis
Oil content affects flavor, texture, and crema in espresso.

- **All Outcomes**: Currently, no exclusions are applied based on oil content.

## Conclusion

Understanding these methods and outcomes can be a powerful tool in identifying or ruling out specific coffee bean varieties. By systematically applying these tests, one can narrow down the possibilities and better appreciate the unique qualities of each coffee type. Enjoy your exploration into the world of coffee!
