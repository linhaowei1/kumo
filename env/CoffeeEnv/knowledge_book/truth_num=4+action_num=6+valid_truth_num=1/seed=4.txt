# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Analysis Guidebook, your guide to understanding the complexities and subtleties behind different coffee bean varieties and the methods used to evaluate them. Here, we aim to demystify some of the most popular coffee varieties and explain how various testing methods can help us identify the unique characteristics of each.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

### Arabica
Arabica beans are renowned for their smooth, mild taste and aromatic properties. They are grown at higher altitudes, making them susceptible to fluctuating weather conditions but also rewarding them with delicate flavors. Arabica is often considered superior due to its subtlety in taste.

### Sumatra
Sumatra beans are known for their full-bodied, earthy flavor with low acidity. They often have complex taste profiles, which may include chocolate, nutty, and even floral notes, largely depending on how they are processed.

### Yirgacheffe
Yirgacheffe coffee beans hail from Ethiopia and are celebrated for their distinctive fruity and floral profiles. They often exhibit wine-like characteristics with vibrant acidity, which makes them highly sought after by coffee connoisseurs.

### Mocha
Mocha beans, originating from Yemen, are distinguished by their rich, chocolatey taste. They are smaller in size and carry an unmistakable and intense flavor that sets them apart from other beans.

## Testing Methods

Now, letâ€™s explore the various testing methods used to analyze these beans and understand how they can help us exclude certain varieties based on particular outcomes observed.

### Aroma Profile Evaluation
This test helps in identifying the unique aromatic qualities of coffee beans. When performing this evaluation:

- **Floral and Fruity Aroma**: Sumatra beans are excluded.
- **Earthy and Woody Aroma**: Yirgacheffe beans are excluded.
- **Nutty and Chocolatey Aroma**: Both Sumatra and Yirgacheffe are excluded.

### DNA Fingerprinting
DNA fingerprinting assists in pinpointing the genetic identity of the coffee beans:

- **Group A**: Does not exclude any varieties.
- **Group B**: Both Arabica and Yirgacheffe are excluded.
- **Group C**: Does not exclude any varieties.

### Bean Size Measurement
This quantitative analysis measures the physical size of the beans:

- **Bean Sizes 7.0 to 8.0**: Does not exclude any varieties.
- **Bean Sizes 8.0 to 9.5**: Mocha beans are excluded.
- **Bean Sizes 9.5 to 12.0**: Mocha beans are excluded.

### Acidity Test
The acidity test measures the pH level of the brewed coffee, contributing to its brightness and liveliness:

- **Acidity Levels 6.0 to 7.0**: Does not exclude any varieties.
- **Acidity Levels 5.0 to 6.0**: Does not exclude any varieties.
- **Acidity Levels 4.0 to 5.0**: Both Arabica and Yirgacheffe are excluded.

### Caffeine Content Analysis
This test determines the caffeine level in the coffee beans:

- **Caffeine Content 0.8 to 1.2**: Does not exclude any varieties.
- **Caffeine Content 1.2 to 1.6**: Does not exclude any varieties.
- **Caffeine Content 1.6 to 2.2**: Arabica beans are excluded.

### Oil Content Analysis
Despite being an important quality metric, current parameters do not exclude any bean varieties based on oil content values tested:

- **Oil Content Levels 15.0 to 17.0**: Does not exclude any varieties.
- **Oil Content Levels 12.0 to 15.0**: Does not exclude any varieties.
- **Oil Content Levels 9.0 to 12.0**: Does not exclude any varieties.

Through these testing methods and the outcomes associated with each, you can gain a deeper insight into differentiating between the prominent coffee bean varieties in the market. Remember, if you identified any coffee transitions where traits do not lead to the exclusions above, additional evaluations might be needed to further narrow down your choice.
