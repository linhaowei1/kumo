# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Analysis Guidebook, a resource for understanding various coffee bean varieties and the methods used to test and analyze them. This guide will cover four prominent coffee bean varieties and six common testing methods used to evaluate coffee characteristics. By understanding these concepts, you'll be equipped to analyze coffee beans effectively.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

1. **Liberica**:
   - Known for its unique flavor profile, Liberica beans are larger and more irregular in shape compared to other coffee varieties. They have a distinctive floral and fruity aroma.

2. **Bourbon**:
   - Bourbon is a highly sought-after variety known for its balance of sweetness and acidity. It often exhibits flavors of caramel and chocolate with slight fruitiness.

3. **SL28**:
   - Originating from Kenya, SL28 is prized for its bright acidity and fruity undertones, often delivering an earthy and woody aroma. It is renowned for producing high-quality coffee.

4. **Catimor**:
   - A hybrid variety known for its resistance to diseases, Catimor tends to have a milder flavor profile with some nutty notes. It is often used for its robust growing qualities.

## Testing Methods

1. **Acidity Test**:
   - Measures the pH level to determine acidity. Coffee beans with different acidity levels are tasted to assess brightness and sharpness in flavor.
   
   Rule-Out Outcomes:
   - **Readings (6.0, 7.0)**: Exclude 'Catimor'
   - **Readings (4.0, 5.0)**: Exclude 'SL28'

2. **Aroma Profile Evaluation**:
   - This method involves sensory analysis to identify aroma notes in coffee beans, such as floral, fruity, earthy, woody, nutty, or chocolatey characteristics.

   Rule-Out Outcomes:
   - **Earthy and Woody**: Exclude 'SL28'

3. **Oil Content Analysis**:
   - Measures the percentage of oil in coffee beans, which can affect flavor and body. 

   Rule-Out Outcomes:
   - **Content (15.0, 17.0)**: Exclude 'Catimor', 'Bourbon'
   - **Content (9.0, 12.0)**: Exclude 'Liberica'

4. **DNA Fingerprinting**:
   - A genetic analysis to classify coffee beans into different genetic groups based on their DNA sequences.

   Rule-Out Outcomes:
   - **Group A**: Exclude 'Liberica'

5. **Caffeine Content Analysis**:
   - Assesses the caffeine present in coffee beans. Caffeine levels can influence the overall stimulation effect and flavor profile.

   Rule-Out Outcomes:
   - **Content (1.6, 2.2)**: Exclude 'Bourbon', 'SL28'

6. **Bean Size Measurement**:
   - Determines the size of coffee beans, often measured in millimeters, which can influence roasting quality and flavor extraction.

   Rule-Out Outcomes:
   - The current data shows all size ranges have no rule-outs, meaning no varieties are excluded based on this test alone.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a framework to understand and apply coffee testing methods effectively, with a focus on ruling out specific coffee bean varieties based on observed outcomes. By using this knowledge, you can deepen your comprehension of coffee analysis, helping identify what makes each variety unique and how they can be characterized through testing.
