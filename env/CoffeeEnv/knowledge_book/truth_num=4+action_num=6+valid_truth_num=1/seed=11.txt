# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Analysis Guidebook. Here, you'll find detailed insights into various coffee bean varieties and testing methods used to evaluate their unique characteristics. This guide is designed to help you understand the relationship between specific outcomes and the exclusion of certain coffee varieties based on different tests. By understanding these tests, you become more adept at discerning which variety may or may not be present given the results.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

1. **Pacamara**: Known for its large bean size, Pacamara is a hybrid well-regarded for its distinct taste profile that often features a combination of sweet and fruity notes.

2. **Lintong**: This variety is celebrated for its complex aroma, characterized by floral and fruity as well as nutty and chocolatey notes. It is typically grown in the Sumatra region and is beloved for its intricate flavors.

3. **Obata**: Obata is a resilient variety, often cultivated for its balanced acidity and consistent quality. It is a cross between Timor Hybrid and Villa Sarchi, offering sustainability against diseases.

4. **Catimor**: Another Timor Hybrid derivative, Catimor is valued for its disease resistance and potential high yield. It often features a high oil content and pleasant acidity, making it a versatile choice.

## Testing Methods

To properly assess and distinguish between these coffee varieties, several tests are employed. Each testing method assists in narrowing down the possible coffee bean types based on specific outcomes, leading to the exclusion of certain beans. These tests include:

### 1. Acidity Test

This test measures the acidity levels in coffee beans. Acidity affects the sharpness and vibrancy of the flavor profile.

- If acidity levels are between 6.0 and 7.0: **Obata** and **Catimor** are ruled out as possibilities.
- If acidity levels are between 5.0 and 6.0: No specific varieties are ruled out.
- If acidity levels are between 4.0 and 5.0: No specific varieties are ruled out.

### 2. Bean Size Measurement

This is a physical test focused on assessing the size of the coffee beans. Larger beans may indicate certain varieties.

- If bean sizes are between 7.0 and 8.0 or 8.0 and 9.5: **Pacamara** is excluded.
- If bean sizes are above 9.5 up to 12.0: No specific varieties are ruled out.

### 3. Oil Content Analysis

The oil content of a bean can significantly influence its flavor richness and mouthfeel.

- If the oil content is between 15.0 and 17.0: **Catimor** is ruled out.
- If the oil content is between 12.0 and 15.0 or 9.0 and 12.0: No specific varieties are ruled out.

### 4. Aroma Profile Evaluation

This subjective test evaluates the aroma notes of the coffee, which is a key indicator of its variety.

- If the aroma is floral and fruity: **Lintong** is excluded.
- If the aroma is earthy and woody: No specific varieties are ruled out.
- If the aroma is nutty and chocolatey: **Lintong** is again excluded.

### 5. Caffeine Content Analysis

This test measures the caffeine concentration in the coffee beans, which can affect taste and strength perception.

- If caffeine content is between 0.8 and 1.2, 1.2 and 1.6, or 1.6 and 2.2: No specific varieties are ruled out.

### 6. DNA Fingerprinting

A precision method used to match genetic markers in coffee plants to known varieties.

- If results correspond to Group A, B, or C: No varieties are ruled out.

By employing these testing methods, you can refine your assessment, exclude certain coffee varieties based on observed outcomes, and hone in on the most likely type of coffee bean under consideration.
