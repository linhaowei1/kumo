# Coffee Bean Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Bean Analysis Guidebook, designed to offer insights into the fascinating world of coffee bean varieties and the testing methods used to analyze their unique characteristics. This guide focuses on four prominent coffee bean varieties and the specific testing methods applied to distinguish their attributes. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential outcomes of these tests and how they relate to identifying or eliminating certain varieties.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

1. **Typica**: Renowned for its balanced flavor and significant historical importance, Typica presents a classic profile cherished by coffee enthusiasts worldwide.

2. **Catimor**: A hybrid specially developed for disease resistance, Catimor often delivers a more robust flavor profile and is appreciated for its high yield and resilience.

3. **Obata**: A variety known for its disease resistance, Obata often features a mild and pleasantly acidic profile, making it a desirable choice for diverse coffee blends.

4. **Sarchimor**: Combining robust disease resistance with a rich flavor profile, Sarchimor is another hybrid variety favored for its adaptability and consistent quality.

## Testing Methods

1. **Acidity Test**: This test measures the acidity level of coffee beans, which greatly influences their taste. Outcomes range from low to high acidity, impacting the perceived brightness and tartness of the coffee.

   - **Outcomes**:
     - Acidity between 6.0 and 7.0: Excludes Obata, Catimor, Sarchimor.
     - Acidity between 5.0 and 6.0: No exclusions.
     - Acidity between 4.0 and 5.0: No exclusions.

2. **Caffeine Content Analysis**: This analysis determines the caffeine concentration within the beans, affecting the energy boost provided by the coffee.

   - **Outcomes**:
     - Caffeine between 0.8 and 1.2 g/100g: No exclusions.
     - Caffeine between 1.2 and 1.6 g/100g: No exclusions.
     - Caffeine between 1.6 and 2.2 g/100g: Excludes Typica.

3. **Oil Content Analysis**: Evaluates the oils present in coffee beans, which contribute to the flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel of the coffee.

   - **Outcomes**:
     - Oil content between 15.0 and 17.0%: Excludes Catimor.
     - Oil content between 12.0 and 15.0%: No exclusions.
     - Oil content between 9.0 and 12.0%: No exclusions.

4. **Bean Size Measurement**: This measurement assesses the size of the beans, which can influence roasting behavior and flavor development.

   - **Outcomes**:
     - Bean size between 7.0 and 8.0 mm: No exclusions.
     - Bean size between 8.0 and 9.5 mm: No exclusions.
     - Bean size between 9.5 and 12.0 mm: No exclusions.

5. **DNA Fingerprinting**: This method identifies the genetic makeup of the coffee beans to ensure authenticity and purity of the variety.

   - **Outcomes**:
     - Group A: No exclusions.
     - Group B: No exclusions.
     - Group C: No exclusions.

6. **Aroma Profile Evaluation**: Focuses on identifying the dominant aromatic qualities that contribute to the overall sensory experience of the coffee.

   - **Outcomes**:
     - Floral and Fruity: No exclusions.
     - Earthy and Woody: No exclusions.
     - Nutty and Chocolatey: No exclusions.

In summary, this guide provides an overview of the connections between various test outcomes and the elimination of certain coffee bean varieties. By understanding these relationships, coffee producers and enthusiasts can better differentiate between bean types, leading to an enriched coffee selection and appreciation.
