# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Analysis Guidebook, designed to help you navigate through the diverse world of coffee bean varieties and testing methods. In this guide, we will introduce you to four unique coffee bean varieties: SL34, Excelsa, Liberica, and Geisha. We will also explore six key testing methods used to analyze these beans: Aroma Profile Evaluation, DNA Fingerprinting, Oil Content Analysis, Acidity Test, Caffeine Content Analysis, and Bean Size Measurement. Each testing method will provide insights that help us eliminate certain varieties based on the observed outcomes.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

### 1. SL34
SL34 is a renowned coffee bean variety known for its adaptability to high altitudes and its potential to produce excellent flavor profiles. However, when certain testing method outcomes are observed, SL34 may be eliminated from consideration, as it does not match specific characteristics.

### 2. Excelsa
Excelsa beans are celebrated for their distinctive tart and fruity profile that contributes complexity to coffee blends. Although certain outcomes in testing may rule out Excelsa, its unique qualities make it a valued component in multi-bean blends.

### 3. Liberica
Liberica coffee, with its large beans and bold flavors, offers a unique taste that deviates from common coffee notes. It's particularly recognized for its floral and fruity aroma. As with other varieties, certain testing outcomes will guide us in excluding it from potential candidates.

### 4. Geisha
Geisha beans are prized for their delicate and complex flavor profile, often featuring notes of jasmine and bergamot. This variety is highly sought after in the specialty coffee market. Testing results can sometimes rule it out based on specific characteristics.

## Testing Methods and Rule-Out Outcomes

### Aroma Profile Evaluation
Aroma plays a critical role in identifying coffee beans. This test assesses the sensory profile of the beans to rule out particular varieties based on their aromatic qualities.

- **Floral and Fruity**: No specific varieties can be ruled out based on this outcome.
- **Earthy and Woody**: When this aroma is detected, SL34 and Geisha are not possibilities.
- **Nutty and Chocolatey**: Geisha is ruled out with this outcome.

### DNA Fingerprinting
DNA Fingerprinting is a genetic analysis that helps categorize coffee beans into different groups, facilitating the exclusion of certain varieties when specific genetic markers are found.

- **Group A**: Liberica is excluded.
- **Group B**: Geisha is excluded.
- **Group C**: Excelsa is excluded.

### Oil Content Analysis
This analysis measures the oil content in coffee beans, which influences flavor and roasting profile.

- **Oil Range 15.0 to 17.0**: No exclusions.
- **Oil Range 12.0 to 15.0**: No exclusions.
- **Oil Range 9.0 to 12.0**: Excelsa and Liberica are excluded.

### Acidity Test
This test determines the acidity level of coffee, which impacts flavor perception.

- **Acidity Range 6.0 to 7.0**: No exclusions.
- **Acidity Range 5.0 to 6.0**: No exclusions.
- **Acidity Range 4.0 to 5.0**: SL34 and Geisha are excluded.

### Caffeine Content Analysis
Caffeine levels are crucial for understanding the energetic effect of a coffee bean variety.

- **Caffeine Range 0.8 to 1.2**: No exclusions.
- **Caffeine Range 1.2 to 1.6**: No exclusions.
- **Caffeine Range 1.6 to 2.2**: SL34 and Geisha are excluded.

### Bean Size Measurement
The size of coffee beans can influence how they are roasted and brewed.

- **Size Range 7.0 to 8.0**: No exclusions.
- **Size Range 8.0 to 9.5**: No exclusions.
- **Size Range 9.5 to 12.0**: No exclusions.

## Conclusion

This guidebook serves as an essential tool for understanding the relationships between coffee bean varieties and the outcomes of various testing methods. By applying the rule-out approach described for each test, coffee professionals can efficiently narrow down the possibilities and deepen their appreciation for the complex nature of coffee beans.
