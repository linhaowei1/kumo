# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed for coffee enthusiasts and professionals looking to deepen their understanding of different coffee bean varieties and the testing methods used to evaluate them. Here, we introduce four distinct coffee bean varieties and six testing methods, detailing how each method can help narrow down the possibilities by excluding certain varieties based on defined outcomes.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

1. **Catuai**: A hybrid variety known for its resilience and moderate coffee profile. Typically yields beans of large size.

2. **Laurina**: Also known as "Bourbon Pointu," Laurina is recognized for its naturally low caffeine content, and it's prized among those who prefer a milder cup.

3. **Sidamo**: Originating from Ethiopia, Sidamo is favored for its rich, earthy, and woody aroma profile that highlights distinct regional characteristics.

4. **Sarchimor**: A hybrid of Timor and Costa Rican Villa Sarchi, known for its disease resistance and moderate acidity levels.

## Testing Methods and Exclusion Outcomes

### 1. Acidity Test
By measuring the acidity level of coffee, we can identify certain characteristics of the varieties.

- **Outcomes:**
  - Acidity between 6.0 and 7.0: If this range is observed, Sarchimor is ruled out.
  - Acidity between 5.0 and 6.0: No specific exclusions.
  - Acidity between 4.0 and 5.0: No specific exclusions.

### 2. Caffeine Content Analysis
This test evaluates the caffeine levels present in coffee beans.

- **Outcomes:**
  - Caffeine between 0.8 and 1.2: No specific exclusions.
  - Caffeine between 1.2 and 1.6: If this range is observed, Laurina is ruled out.
  - Caffeine between 1.6 and 2.2: No specific exclusions.

### 3. Bean Size Measurement
The physical size of coffee beans can offer clues to their variety.

- **Outcomes:**
  - Size between 7.0 and 8.0 mm: No specific exclusions.
  - Size between 8.0 and 9.5 mm: No specific exclusions.
  - Size between 9.5 and 12.0 mm: If this size is measured, Catuai is ruled out.

### 4. Aroma Profile Evaluation
The aroma of coffee is a key characteristic in identifying its origins and varieties.

- **Outcomes:**
  - Floral and Fruity: No specific exclusions.
  - Earthy and Woody: If this profile is noted, Sidamo is ruled out.
  - Nutty and Chocolatey: No specific exclusions.

### 5. Oil Content Analysis
Assessing the oil content helps determine the richness and mouthfeel of the coffee.

- **Outcomes:**
  - Oil content between 15.0 and 17.0%: No specific exclusions.
  - Oil content between 12.0 and 15.0%: No specific exclusions.
  - Oil content between 9.0 and 12.0%: No specific exclusions.

### 6. DNA Fingerprinting
This advanced method provides genetic analysis for identifying specific coffee varieties.

- **Outcomes:**
  - Group A: No specific exclusions.
  - Group B: No specific exclusions.
  - Group C: No specific exclusions.

## Conclusion

Understanding the exclusions involved with each testing method helps in the precise identification and differentiation of coffee bean varieties. By ruling out specific beans based on the outcomes of various tests, we can hone in on the characteristics that define each type, thus allowing for a more accurate and enriching coffee analysis experience.
