# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Analysis Guidebook, designed to introduce you to the fascinating world of coffee bean varieties and the methods used to analyze them. Here, we explore four distinctive coffee bean varieties and six testing methods to better understand and classify each bean.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

1. **Geisha**: Known for its unique and exquisite flavor profile, Geisha beans often surprise with floral and fruity notes. They are highly sought after for their distinct taste and acidity.

2. **Kouillou**: These beans are known for their robust flavor and higher caffeine content compared to other varieties. Kouillou coffee is typically strong and bold.

3. **Lintong**: Originating from Sumatra, Lintong beans are recognized for their rich, earthy flavor with occasional floral undertones. They are favored for their balanced and complex taste.

4. **Catuai**: A hybrid coffee variety cultivated for its resilience and versatility. Catuai beans often yield a consistent and pleasant flavor, with a tendency towards medium acidity.

## Testing Methods and Rule-Out Outcomes

To accurately identify and categorize these varieties, we employ a series of testing methods. Each method provides insights by helping rule out specific coffee bean varieties based on the observed outcomes.

### 1. Caffeine Content Analysis

- **0.8 - 1.2%** Caffeine: Ruling out Kouillou
- **1.2 - 1.6%** Caffeine: Ruling out Kouillou
- **1.6 - 2.2%** Caffeine: Ruling out Geisha

Here, caffeine content helps eliminate certain beans known for corresponding caffeine levels.

### 2. Aroma Profile Evaluation

- **Floral and Fruity**: Ruling out Lintong
- **Earthy and Woody**: Ruling out Geisha
- **Nutty and Chocolatey**: Ruling out Geisha and Lintong

Assessing the aroma can immediately rule out varieties with contrasting scent profiles.

### 3. DNA Fingerprinting

- **Group A**: No varieties are eliminated
- **Group B**: Ruling out Geisha
- **Group C**: No varieties are eliminated

DNA analysis assists in excluding varieties based on genetic markers, although Geisha is the primary exclusion in this grouping.

### 4. Bean Size Measurement

- **7.0 - 8.0 mm**: No varieties are eliminated
- **8.0 - 9.5 mm**: No varieties are eliminated
- **9.5 - 12.0 mm**: Ruling out Catuai

Size measurement helps narrow down the field by excluding bean sizes typical to certain varieties.

### 5. Acidity Test

- **6.0 - 7.0 pH**: No varieties are eliminated
- **5.0 - 6.0 pH**: No varieties are eliminated
- **4.0 - 5.0 pH**: Ruling out Geisha

Acidity can often be distinctive, effectively eliminating varieties that do not match the profile.

### 6. Oil Content Analysis

- **15.0 - 17.0%** Oil: No varieties are eliminated
- **12.0 - 15.0%** Oil: No varieties are eliminated
- **9.0 - 12.0%** Oil: No varieties are eliminated

This analysis showed no exclusions across the given oil content outcomes for these varieties.

By utilizing these testing methods, coffee analysts can determine which varieties are not feasible candidates based on their distinctive characteristics. This guide offers a systematic approach to understanding how each outcome can effectively narrow down the pool of possible coffee bean varieties, ensuring you find the perfect bean for your taste and needs.
