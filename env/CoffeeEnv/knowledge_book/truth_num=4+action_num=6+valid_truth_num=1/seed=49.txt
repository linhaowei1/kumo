# Coffee Bean Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Bean Analysis Guidebook! This guide aims to demystify the world of coffee bean varieties and the testing methods used to evaluate their unique characteristics. We will introduce four distinct coffee bean varieties and explain six testing methods by exploring how they help us identify or rule out various beans.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

1. **Maragogype**: Known for its large bean size, the Maragogype often goes by the nickname "Elephant Bean." Highly sought after for its smooth and nuanced flavor profile that varies with cultivation regions, it presents a sophisticated tasting experience.

2. **Robusta**: This variety is tough and resilient, often used in blends for its high caffeine content and earthy flavors. It thrives in lower altitudes and warmer climates, making it a staple in many commercial coffee products.

3. **Excelsa**: A highly aromatic and flavorful variety, Excelsa contributes to a coffee's pungency when blended. It typically grows on large, hardy trees that bear fruits with distinctive undertones.

4. **Yirgacheffe**: Originating from Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe is renowned for its bright acidity and floral, fruity aroma. These beans create a coffee experience reminiscent of peaches or other stone fruits.

## Testing Methods

1. **Aroma Profile Evaluation**: Involves smelling and tasting brewed coffee to identify predominant aromatic notes such as florals, fruits, nuts, earthiness, or woodiness. 
    
   - If a **Floral and Fruity** aroma is noted, this hints at varieties other than Robusta.
   - An **Earthy and Woody** profile rules out Yirgacheffe.
   - When **Nutty and Chocolatey** aromas predominate, Yirgacheffe is not the source.

2. **Bean Size Measurement**: This method involves measuring the physical size of coffee beans. 
    
   - Beans measuring between **7.0 and 8.0** (mm) are not Maragogype.
   - Measurements between **8.0 and 9.5** (mm) also exclude Maragogype, while beans larger than **9.5 to 12.0** (mm) help narrow the list but exclude no specific variety.

3. **Oil Content Analysis**: Determines the amount of oil produced by the beans, influencing the mouthfeel and richness of the brew.
    
   - Beans with an oil content of **15.0 to 17.0%** are not Robusta.
   - Observing an oil range between **12.0 and 15.0%** excludes no particular variety.
   - An oil content of **9.0 to 12.0%** rules out Excelsa.

4. **Caffeine Content Analysis**: Measures the caffeine level, affecting the strength and intensity of the coffee's flavor.
    
   - Coffee with caffeine levels from **0.8 to 1.2%** excludes Robusta.
   - Similarly, levels between **1.2 and 1.6%** mean Robusta isn't involved, while a range of **1.6 to 2.2%** does not exclude any variety.

5. **Acidity Test**: Evaluates the acidity level, a key aspect of flavor profile influencing the coffee's brightness and sparkle.
    
   - Acidity levels of **6.0 to 7.0** indicate a variety other than Robusta.
   - For levels between **5.0 and 6.0**, no specific exclusion occurs.
   - If acidity measures **4.0 to 5.0**, Yirgacheffe can be ruled out.

6. **DNA Fingerprinting**: This advanced method uses genetic markers to classify and differentiate between different coffee varieties.
    
   - **Group A** identifies the presence of Robusta, thereby excluding other varieties.
   - **Group B** signifies the presence of Yirgacheffe, ruling out other varieties.
   - **Group C** includes Excelsa and Maragogype, excluding the remaining varieties.

By leveraging these tests, coffee connoisseurs and roasters can gain deeper insights into the origins and characteristics of the beans they work with, ensuring a premium experience in every cup.
