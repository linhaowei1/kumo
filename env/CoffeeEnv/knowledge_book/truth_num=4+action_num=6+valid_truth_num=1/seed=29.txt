# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Analysis Guidebook, where we delve into the fascinating world of coffee bean varieties and the methods used to analyze them. This guide will introduce you to four distinct coffee bean varieties and explain how various testing methods can help in identifying and understanding these beans. Remember, the results of these tests help us rule out certain bean varieties based on observed outcomes.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

1. **Maragogype**
   - Known for its large bean size, Maragogype is often referred to as the "Elephant Bean." This variety thrives in high-altitude regions and is renowned for its smooth and mild cup profile.

2. **Lintong**
   - Originating from the Lintong region of Sumatra, this variety offers a rich, nutty, and chocolatey aroma profile. It is prized for its full body and complex flavors.

3. **Robusta**
   - A hardy varietal known for its strong, earthy flavors and high caffeine content. Robusta beans are often used in espresso blends to add body and depth.

4. **Bourbon**
   - Bourbon is a classic variety appreciated for its sweet, fruity notes and balanced acidity. It is widely cultivated and highly regarded for producing high-quality coffee.

## Testing Methods and Their Outcomes

### 1. Aroma Profile Evaluation
This test identifies the aromatic characteristics of coffee beans. By observing the aroma, we can rule out specific varieties:

- **Floral and Fruity:** This profile can exclude varieties like Lintong and Robusta, indicating they are likely not the source of the beans tested.
- **Nutty and Chocolatey:** Observing this aroma profile suggests excluding Lintong as it might not match.

### 2. Bean Size Measurement
Bean size can be a major identifier for certain varieties:

- **Sizes 7.0 to 8.0 mm:** Observing a bean size in this range can help rule out Maragogype as these beans typically exceed 8.0 mm.
- **Sizes 8.0 to 9.5 mm:** If beans fall under this measurement, it points to possibilities outside Maragogype.
- **Sizes 9.5 mm and above:** Although this size is not associated with any exclusions, Maragogype beans typically fall within these measurements.

### 3. DNA Fingerprinting
This advanced method categorizes beans based on genetic profiles:

- **Group A:** Excludes Robusta from this genetic classification.
- **Group C:** Excludes Maragogype, indicating that beans from this group are not likely of this variety.

### 4. Acidity Test
Acidity levels in coffee influence flavor perception:

- **Acidity Range 6.0 to 7.0:** Observing this level rules out Robusta, suggesting other varieties might be present.
- **Acidity levels below 6.0:** No exclusions defined, meaning a broader range of beans might fit.

### 5. Caffeine Content Analysis
Caffeine analysis can provide insights into the potential bean type:

- **Caffeine Range 0.8 to 1.2 mg:** This excludes Robusta, pointing to beans with potentially lower caffeine content.
- **Caffeine Range 1.2 to 1.6 mg:** Again, high caffeine excludes Robusta varieties in this range.
- **Caffeine Range 1.6 to 2.2 mg:** Observed caffeine levels here rule out Bourbon, suggesting the presence might lie elsewhere.

### 6. Oil Content Analysis
Oil content affects the texture and body of the brewed coffee:

- **Oil Content 15.0 to 17.0%:** Observing this oil level means Robusta and Bourbon can be excluded, as they contribute higher oil content than expected.
- **Oil ranges below 15.0%:** No exclusions identified, opening possibilities for these beans.

By using these testing methods, one can effectively pinpoint and exclude coffee bean varieties based on specific outcomes and characteristics. This guide serves as a foundational tool in understanding and analyzing coffee beans comprehensively and accurately.
