# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to this comprehensive guidebook on coffee bean analysis. This guide will introduce you to some popular coffee bean varieties and explain various testing methods used to analyze their characteristics. We will explore these varieties and test outcomes in a way that focuses on ruling out possible varieties rather than confirming them. Let's dive into the details.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

### 1. Yirgacheffe
Yirgacheffe is a renowned coffee variety originating from Ethiopia. It is celebrated for its unique flavor profile, often featuring bright acidity with floral and fruity notes. This variety is often sought after by enthusiasts for its distinctive aromatic qualities.

### 2. Mocha
Mocha coffee beans are known for their rich and bold flavors, often showcasing chocolate and nutty undertones. Traditionally coming from Yemen, these beans have a significant heritage and are often associated with intense and complex cup profiles.

### 3. Typica
Typica is one of the most traditional coffee varieties and serves as a genetic backbone for many other coffee types. It typically has a well-balanced flavor with sweet, complex notes, and lower acidic profiles.

### 4. Conilon
Conilon is robusta coffee that is primarily grown in Brazil. It is characterized by a stronger, more robust flavor with higher caffeine content. Its earthy and sometimes fruity notes make it a significant component in espresso blends.

## Testing Methods

### 1. Caffeine Content Analysis
This analysis measures the caffeine levels present in coffee beans. The results can rule out varieties with specific caffeine content ranges.

- If the caffeine content is between 0.8 and 1.2 or 1.2 and 1.6, Conilon can be ruled out.
- If the caffeine content is between 1.6 and 2.2, Typica can be ruled out.

### 2. Aroma Profile Evaluation
In this method, the aroma of coffee beans is analyzed to identify distinct profiles:

- If the aroma is described as floral and fruity, Conilon can be ruled out.
- If the aroma is earthy and woody or nutty and chocolatey, Yirgacheffe can be ruled out.

### 3. DNA Fingerprinting
This testing method involves analyzing the genetic fingerprint of coffee beans to determine their group:

- If the DNA fingerprint belongs to Group B, Yirgacheffe can be ruled out.

### 4. Acidity Test
This test evaluates the acidity level of coffee. Different acidity levels can help rule out certain varieties:

- If the acidity is between 4.0 and 5.0, Yirgacheffe can be ruled out.
- If the acidity is between 5.0 and 6.0 or 6.0 and 7.0, no specific varieties can be ruled out.

### 5. Bean Size Measurement
This method measures the size of the coffee beans:

- If the bean size falls between 8.0 and 9.5 or 9.5 and 12.0, Mocha can be ruled out.
- If the bean size is between 7.0 and 8.0, no specific varieties can be ruled out.

### 6. Oil Content Analysis
This testing method checks the oil content in coffee beans:

- If the oil content is between 9.0 and 12.0, 12.0 and 15.0, or 15.0 and 17.0, no specific varieties can be ruled out.

By understanding these testing methods and their outcomes, you can more accurately assess and identify the range of coffee beans being analyzed. By ruling out specific characteristics, you narrow down your options, which aids in determining the most likely variety.
