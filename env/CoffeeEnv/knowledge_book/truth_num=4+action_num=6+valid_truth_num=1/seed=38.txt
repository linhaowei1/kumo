# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Analysis Guidebook, a comprehensive resource for understanding various coffee bean varieties and the scientific testing methods used to evaluate them. This guide will introduce the primary coffee bean varieties we focus on and outline the testing methods that help us decipher their characteristics by ruling out certain possibilities. Let’s dive in!

## Coffee Bean Varieties

1. **Geisha:**
   - Known for its unique and aromatic flavor profile, often exhibiting floral, fruity, and occasionally nutty and chocolatey notes. 
   - It is celebrated for its superior quality and origin, mostly from Panama and Ethiopia.

2. **Excelsa:**
   - Offers a unique and complex flavor profile that can include notes of tartness and fruity undertones.
   - Often used in blends to provide depth and additional flavor dimensions.

3. **Java Robusta:**
   - Noted for its strong and full-bodied profile, often with earthy undertones and substantial caffeine content.
   - Primarily cultivated in Indonesia and known for its resilience and high yield.

4. **Mocha:**
   - Renowned for its rich and full flavors with hints of chocolate and fruit, usually softer in acidity.
   - Traditionally grown in Yemen and Ethiopia, historically acclaimed for its role in coffee history.

## Testing Methods

1. **Aroma Profile Evaluation:**
   - This test focuses on identifying the scent characteristics of coffee beans, such as floral, fruity, earthy, woody, nutty, or chocolatey profiles.
   - Outcomes:
     - Floral and Fruity: If detected, exclude Java Robusta.
     - Earthy and Woody: If observed, rule out Geisha.
     - Nutty and Chocolatey: If identified, eliminate Geisha.

2. **Bean Size Measurement:**
   - This involves measuring the size spectrum of coffee beans, providing insights into the variety’s grading.
   - Outcomes:
     - Sizes (7.0, 8.0): No direct exclusions.
     - Sizes (8.0, 9.5): Exclude Mocha.
     - Sizes (9.5, 12.0): Exclude Mocha.

3. **Oil Content Analysis:**
   - Measures the oil content within coffee beans, which can influence taste and storage.
   - Outcomes:
     - Oil Content (15.0, 17.0): No direct exclusions.
     - Oil Content (12.0, 15.0): No specific exclusions.
     - Oil Content (9.0, 12.0): Rule out Excelsa.

4. **Acidity Test:**
   - Assesses the acidity level of coffee, impacting the perceived taste intensity and liveliness.
   - Outcomes:
     - Acidity (6.0, 7.0): No direct exclusions.
     - Acidity (5.0, 6.0): No determined exclusions.
     - Acidity (4.0, 5.0): Rule out Geisha.

5. **DNA Fingerprinting:**
   - A genetic analysis method that provides conclusive identification of the coffee bean varieties based on genetic markers.
   - Outcomes:
     - Group A: No specific exclusions.
     - Group B: Exclude Geisha.
     - Group C: Exclude Excelsa.

6. **Caffeine Content Analysis:**
   - Evaluates the caffeine levels in coffee beans, which can vary widely among different varieties.
   - Outcomes:
     - Caffeine Content (0.8, 1.2): Exclude Java Robusta.
     - Caffeine Content (1.2, 1.6): Exclude Java Robusta.
     - Caffeine Content (1.6, 2.2): Rule out Geisha.

Through these tests, we can refine our understanding of each bean’s unique qualities while determining which varieties can be progressively ruled out. This approach ensures that we maintain a clear path toward identifying the specific traits of each coffee bean variety. By using these guidelines, one can accurately profile and understand the coffee beans they are working with.
