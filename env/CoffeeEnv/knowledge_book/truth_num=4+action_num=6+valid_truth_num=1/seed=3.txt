# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
Welcome to the world of coffee bean analysis! This guidebook aims to navigate you through the intriguing varieties of coffee beans and the sophisticated methods used to analyze and identify them. This journey will help you understand the nuances of each bean type and how various tests can effectively differentiate among them by eliminating certain possibilities. Let's dive into the aromatic universe of coffee beans.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

**1. Arabica:** Known for its smooth and mild flavor profile, Arabica beans are highly esteemed in the coffee world. They are generally grown at higher altitudes and are more sensitive to climate changes than other types.

**2. Catimor:** A less common variety, Catimor is a hybrid resulting from a cross between Timor and Caturra types. It tends to have a robust flavor and varies significantly in taste based on specific growing conditions.

**3. Conilon:** Also identified as Robusta, Conilon beans are known for their strong, bold flavors and higher caffeine content. They are often used in espresso blends due to their intense characteristics.

**4. Typica:** One of the oldest coffee bean varieties, Typica forms the foundation for many other hybrids and possesses a balanced and classic coffee flavor.

## Testing Methods and Outcomes

To determine the variety of a coffee bean, various testing methods can be employed. These methods help identify characteristic signatures or elements that can rule out specific varieties based on observed outcomes. Let's explore each method and its exclusion outcomes.

### 1. Acidity Test
This test measures the acidity levels in coffee beans, which is a critical factor in establishing flavor profile.

- **Acidity Range 6.0 - 7.0:** When you observe this range, rule out Catimor; it doesn't fit the profile.
  
- **Acidity Range 5.0 - 6.0:** No specific variety is excluded with this measurement range.
  
- **Acidity Range 4.0 - 5.0:** Observing this level, you can rule out Arabica as a possibility.

### 2. Caffeine Content Analysis
This test measures the caffeine content, providing insights into the coffee's strength and flavor intensity.

- **Caffeine Range 0.8 - 1.2:** Rule out Conilon, as it doesn't align with this caffeine content.
  
- **Caffeine Range 1.2 - 1.6:** Again, exclude Conilon if this range is detected.
  
- **Caffeine Range 1.6 - 2.2:** The presence of this higher caffeine level suggests ruling out Arabica and Typica.

### 3. Aroma Profile Evaluation
This sensory analysis categorizes the coffee's aroma, an essential characteristic in identifying bean variety.

- **Floral and Fruity:** Rule out Conilon, as it doesn't exhibit these aromas.
  
- **Earthy and Woody:** There are no exclusions for bean varieties under this aroma category.
  
- **Nutty and Chocolatey:** No coffee varieties are excluded based on these aroma notes.

### 4. Oil Content Analysis
This test measures the oil content in the beans, influencing texture and flavor.

- **Oil Range 15.0 - 17.0:** Rule out Catimor if you observe this oil content.
  
- **Oil Range 12.0 - 15.0:** No varieties are excluded based on this range.
  
- **Oil Range 9.0 - 12.0:** Again, no exclusions apply for this outcome.

### 5. DNA Fingerprinting
A more scientific method, DNA fingerprinting, analyzes the genetic makeup of the beans.

- **Group A:** No specific coffee varieties are ruled out.
  
- **Group B:** Rule out Arabica if this genetic profile is observed.
  
- **Group C:** No exclusions are required under this group.

### 6. Bean Size Measurement
This physical measurement of the bean can sometimes indicate specific varietal traits, though no current direct exclusions are linked to this method.

- **Bean Size 7.0 - 8.0, 8.0 - 9.5, 9.5 - 12.0:** No specific varieties are currently excluded on the basis of these bean sizes.

## Conclusion
In coffee analysis, understanding each test's outcomes and subsequent exclusions is vital for accurately identifying coffee bean varieties. This guidebook offers a straightforward method for ruling out certain varieties based on distinct test outcomes. Whether you're a connoisseur or an industry professional, this resource aims to enhance your knowledge and appreciation for the diverse world of coffee beans. Enjoy the exploration!
