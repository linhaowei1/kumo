# Coffee Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Coffee Analysis Guidebook, your comprehensive resource for understanding and evaluating different coffee bean varieties using specific testing methods. This guide will introduce you to four unique coffee bean varieties—Geisha, Excelsa, Arabica, and Mocha—and describe the key testing methods used to analyze them: Oil Content Analysis, DNA Fingerprinting, Bean Size Measurement, Aroma Profile Evaluation, Acidity Test, and Caffeine Content Analysis. By understanding these elements, you will know how to exclude specific varieties based on testing outcomes.

## Coffee Bean Varieties

1. **Geisha**: Known for its floral and fruity aromas, Geisha beans are highly valued for their distinctive taste profile and unique acidity.

2. **Excelsa**: Often contributing to blends, Excelsa beans add complexity with their tart, fruity flavors.

3. **Arabica**: The most popular coffee bean worldwide, Arabica is prized for its smooth flavor and balanced acidity.

4. **Mocha**: Originating from Yemen, Mocha beans are known for their rich chocolatey flavor and smaller bean size.

## Testing Methods

### 1. Oil Content Analysis
This test measures the oil content of coffee beans, which can influence flavor and texture.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **15.0 - 17.0%**: This range does not rule out any specific varieties.
  - **12.0 - 15.0%**: No varieties are excluded by this outcome.
  - **9.0 - 12.0%**: The presence of Excelsa can be ruled out with this oil content measurement.

### 2. DNA Fingerprinting
DNA Fingerprinting analyzes the genetic makeup of coffee beans to categorize them into groups.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Group A**: No varieties are excluded in this grouping.
  - **Group B**: Both Arabica and Geisha are ruled out if the beans fall under this group.
  - **Group C**: Excelsa can be eliminated from consideration.

### 3. Bean Size Measurement
This test assesses coffee beans based on their size, which can affect the roast profile and flavor extraction.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **7.0 - 8.0 mm**: This size range does not exclude any specific bean varieties.
  - **8.0 - 9.5 mm**: This measurement rules out Mocha.
  - **9.5 - 12.0 mm**: Mocha is excluded.

### 4. Aroma Profile Evaluation
This test evaluates the aromatic characteristics of coffee beans.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Floral and Fruity**: No specific variety is ruled out by this profile.
  - **Earthy and Woody**: Geisha beans are excluded.
  - **Nutty and Chocolatey**: Geisha beans are ruled out.

### 5. Acidity Test
The acidity level in coffee beans is an important indicator of flavor profile and quality.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **6.0 - 7.0**: No exclusions based on this acidity range.
  - **5.0 - 6.0**: This level does not exclude particular varieties.
  - **4.0 - 5.0**: Both Arabica and Geisha are excluded under this acidity condition.

### 6. Caffeine Content Analysis
This test measures the caffeine content within coffee beans, crucial for flavor and consumer preference.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **0.8 - 1.2%**: No varieties are excluded based on this caffeine range.
  - **1.2 - 1.6%**: This range does not eliminate any specific varietal.
  - **1.6 - 2.2%**: Both Arabica and Geisha are ruled out if the caffeine content falls in this range.

In conclusion, understanding and interpreting the outcomes from these various tests enables a clear process of exclusion, helping you to identify which coffee bean varieties align with your specific findings or needs in coffee production or selection.
