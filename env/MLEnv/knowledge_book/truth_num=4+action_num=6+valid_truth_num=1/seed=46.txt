# Machine Learning Model Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to provide a clear understanding of several machine learning models and evaluation techniques. It outlines how different evaluation outcomes can be used to rule out certain models based on their performance characteristics.

## Machine Learning Models

1. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: This model is an extension of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for regression problems. It uses a technique to fit the best line within a specified margin, known as the epsilon-tube, around it. SVR is particularly useful for capturing complex nonlinear relationships in the data.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: This is an unsupervised learning approach used to group data into clusters based on their similarities, forming a hierarchy of clusters. The output can be visualized as a dendrogram, where clusters are successively merged or split apart.

3. **Topic Models**: These are used for discovering the abstract topics within a collection of documents. A widely used topic model is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which assumes documents are a mixture of topics and topics are a mixture of words.

4. **Polynomial Regression**: This is an extension of linear regression where the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. It's particularly useful when data shows a curvilinear trend.

## Evaluation Techniques and Their Rule-Out Criteria

### 1. Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- MSE measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values, indicating the variance of the estimator.
- **Rule-Out Criteria**:
  - MSE values between 20 and 100 rule out: **Polynomial Regression** and **Support Vector Regression**.

### 2. Compute Perplexity
- Perplexity is a measure used for evaluating language models and topic models; it indicates how well a probability distribution or model relates to the sample.
- **Rule-Out Criteria**:
  - Perplexity values between 10 and 100 rule out: **Topic Models**.

### 3. Evaluate Silhouette Score
- This score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. It ranges from -1 to 1, where a higher score indicates well-defined clusters.
- **Rule-Out Criteria**:
  - Silhouette Score values between 0.0 and 0.3 rule out: **Hierarchical Clustering**.

### 4. Perform Residual Analysis
- Residual analysis involves evaluating the difference between observed and predicted values to assess the fit's quality.
- **Rule-Out Criteria**:
  - Observing non-normal residuals rule out: **Polynomial Regression**.

### 5. Test Homoscedasticity
- Homoscedasticity tests check if the variance of errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables, an assumption of linear regression models.
- **Rule-Out Criteria**:
  - Observing heteroscedasticity rule out: **Polynomial Regression**.

### 6. Compute R-squared Score
- The R-squared score indicates the proportion of variance explained by the independent variable(s) in the model. It ranges from 0 to 1.
- **Rule-Out Criteria**:
  - R-squared scores between 0.0 and 0.3 rule out: **Polynomial Regression**.

## Conclusion

The evaluation techniques presented provide valuable insights into model performance and can be used strategically to exclude certain models based on specific outcomes. By understanding which models fail under certain evaluation criteria, you can make informed decisions on which models to focus on for further development and refinement. This guide serves as a handy reference for ruling out models based on standard evaluation metrics and observations.
