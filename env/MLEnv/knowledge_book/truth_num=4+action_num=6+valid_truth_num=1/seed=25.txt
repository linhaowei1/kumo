# Machine Learning Model Analysis Guidebook

In this guidebook, we aim to enhance your understanding of various machine learning models and evaluation techniques. By integrating the knowledge of model properties and evaluation outcomes, you'll be equipped to make informed decisions on which models to exclude based on certain evaluation metrics. We will cover four different machine learning models and describe their interaction with six evaluation techniques in detail.

## Machine Learning Models

1. **Linear Regression**
   - A statistical method used for predicting a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It's best suited for scenarios where the relationship between variables is linear and multicollinearity is minimal.

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - A classification technique that finds the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes. SVMs are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and are versatile for linear and nonlinear classification.

3. **Topic Models**
   - Techniques for discovering latent themes or topics in a set of documents. These are usually unsupervised models, with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) being one of the most popular.

4. **Random Guess Model**
   - A simple model that makes predictions by randomly guessing. It serves as a baseline in classification tasks to indicate the performance level of a model with no learned behavior.

## Evaluation Techniques

### 1. Compute Kappa Statistic
- **Purpose:** Measures the agreement between two raters or models that categorize data into two or more classes.
- **Outcome Analysis:**
  - If the Kappa statistic ranges between 0.0 and 0.2, **Random Guess Model** is excluded as it indicates no better than chance agreement.

### 2. Conduct ANOVA Test
- **Purpose:** Determines whether there are statistically significant differences between the means of three or more unrelated groups.
- **Outcome Analysis:**
  - If a significant difference is observed, **Linear Regression** is excluded, indicating there is a significant difference in the means of groups.

### 3. Evaluate Feature Importances
- **Purpose:** Determines the influence of each feature in making predictions with a model.
- **Outcome Analysis:**
  - When feature importance is not available, **Support Vector Machine** is excluded as it typically doesn't provide feature importance due to its non-linear nature.

### 4. Compute F1 Score
- **Purpose:** Reflects the balance between precision and recall, being especially useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
- **Outcome Analysis:**
  - If the F1 score is between 0.6 and 0.9, **Support Vector Machine** is excluded as it suggests moderate precision and recall, thus not fitting an optimal model scenario for high stakes tasks.

### 5. Assess Multicollinearity
- **Purpose:** Evaluates the degree to which independent variables are correlated, affecting the stability and interpretation of a model.
- **Outcome Analysis:**
  - If high multicollinearity is detected, **Linear Regression** is excluded due to its sensitivity to independent variable correlation, leading to unreliable coefficient estimates.

### 6. Compute Recall
- **Purpose:** Indicates the modelâ€™s ability to find all the relevant cases within a dataset, crucial for scenarios where missing positive cases is costly.
- **Outcome Analysis:**
  - If recall is between 0.0 and 0.5, **Support Vector Machine** is excluded as it indicates insufficient sensitivity for applications requiring high recall rates.

## Conclusion

By understanding these models and their respective evaluation techniques, you can effectively use the evaluation outcomes to rule out models that do not meet the criteria for your specific needs. This guide empowers you to discern which models are not suitable under certain conditions, thus streamlining your model selection process.
