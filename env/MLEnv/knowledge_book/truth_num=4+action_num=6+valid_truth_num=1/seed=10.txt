# Machine Learning Model Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an overview of several machine learning models and evaluation techniques. Our goal is to help practitioners understand these techniques and how to analyze different outcomes to eliminate incompatible models consistently. 

## Machine Learning Models

1. **Polynomial Regression**: 
   - Polynomial Regression is a form of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. It is useful when data relationships become non-linear.

2. **Topic Models**:
   - Topic Models are used to discover the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. They help in organizing, understanding, and summarizing textual data.

3. **Multi-label Classification Models**:
   - Multi-label Classification involves predicting multiple labels for a single instance. This is different from multi-class classification, where each instance is assigned a single class from multiple possibilities.

4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
   - Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. They work by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes.

## Evaluation Techniques

1. **Compute Confusion Matrix**:
   - A confusion matrix is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model. It shows the True Positive, False Positive, False Negative, and True Negative results.

   **Outcomes Analysis**:
   - **High False Positives**: Rule out Support Vector Machine.
   - **High False Negatives**: No exclusions.
   - **Balanced Errors**: No exclusions.

2. **Compute Perplexity**:
   - Perplexity is a measurement of how well a probability model predicts a sample. Lower perplexity indicates a better predictive model.

   **Outcomes Analysis**:
   - **Perplexity (0.0, 10.0)**: No exclusions.
   - **Perplexity (10.0, 100.0)**: Rule out Topic Models.

3. **Evaluate Coverage Error**:
   - Coverage error quantifies how well a multi-label classification model can cover all the possible true labels in the predictions.

   **Outcomes Analysis**:
   - **Coverage Error (1.0, 2.0)**: No exclusions.
   - **Coverage Error (2.0, 10.0)**: Rule out Multi-label Classification Models.

4. **Perform Residual Analysis**:
   - Residual Analysis involves examining the residuals of a model to determine how well the model fits the data. Residuals are the difference between observed and predicted responses.

   **Outcomes Analysis**:
   - **Normal Residuals**: No exclusions.
   - **Non-normal Residuals**: Rule out Polynomial Regression.

5. **Compute Adjusted R-squared**:
   - Adjusted R-squared adjusts the R-squared statistic in regression models by considering the number of predictors. It provides a more accurate measure by penalizing the addition of unnecessary variables.

   **Outcomes Analysis**:
   - **Adjusted R-squared (0.0, 0.2)**: Rule out Polynomial Regression.
   - **Adjusted R-squared (0.2, 0.5)**: No exclusions.
   - **Adjusted R-squared (0.5, 1.0)**: No exclusions.

6. **Compute F1 Score**:
   - The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is a useful measure when you have class imbalance and want a single metric to validate model performance.

   **Outcomes Analysis**:
   - **F1 Score (0.0, 0.6)**: No exclusions.
   - **F1 Score (0.6, 0.9)**: Rule out Support Vector Machine.
   - **F1 Score (0.9, 1.0)**: No exclusions.

By understanding these models and applying the appropriate evaluation techniques, we can effectively narrow down model possibilities based on the observed outcomes. This structured approach aids in model selection and enhances decision-making in machine learning analysis.
