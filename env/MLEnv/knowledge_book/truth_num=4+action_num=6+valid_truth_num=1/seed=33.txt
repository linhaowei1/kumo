# Machine Learning Model Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to help you understand the basics of several machine learning models, explain how to evaluate these models using different performance metrics, and provide insights on ruling out certain models based on specific evaluation outcomes. By understanding these components, you can make informed decisions about which model may be most appropriate for your analysis.

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Polynomial Regression
Polynomial Regression is an extension of linear regression that models the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y as an nth degree polynomial. It is useful for modeling non-linear relationships.

### 2. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
Gaussian Mixture Models are probabilistic models representing a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions. GMMs are often used for clustering tasks, where each Gaussian represents a cluster.

### 3. Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis. The model assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y).

### 4. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is primarily used for classification problems. It estimates the probability that an instance belongs to a particular category. It works well for binary classifications and can be extended for multi-class classifications.

## Evaluation Techniques

### Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE)
MSE measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and actual value. It's used to evaluate the accuracy of regression models.

**Outcomes:**
- If MSE is between 10.0 and 20.0, **rule out** Linear Regression.
- If MSE is between 20.0 and 100.0, **rule out** Polynomial Regression.

### Compute Perplexity
Perplexity is a measurement of how well a probability model predicts a sample. It's commonly used for language models but can also apply to evaluating GMM.

**Outcomes:**
- If Perplexity is between 10.0 and 100.0, **rule out** Gaussian Mixture Model.

### Evaluate ROC AUC for Multi-class
The ROC AUC score is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It ranges from 0 to 1. A high score indicates a good model performance for distinguishing between classes.

**Outcomes:**
- If ROC AUC is between 0.5 and 0.7, **rule out** Logistic Regression.

### Compute Recall
Recall measures the ability of a model to identify all the relevant cases (true positives). It's particularly useful in scenarios where missing positives is a critical issue, such as in medical test diagnosis.

**Outcomes:**
- If Recall is between 0.0 and 0.5, **rule out** Logistic Regression.

### Compute R-squared Score
R-squared indicates how well data fit a statistical model – percentage of variation explained by the independent variables in the model.

**Outcomes:**
- If R-squared is between 0.0 and 0.3, **rule out both** Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.

### Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
MAE is the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It provides insight into the accuracy of regression-based models.

**Outcomes:**
- If MAE is between 5.0 and 10.0, **rule out** Linear Regression.

This guide can help inform your selection of an appropriate model by effectively applying evaluation techniques to rule out non-ideal models for your specific data and analysis context. By understanding the outcomes associated with each evaluation metric, you can streamline the process of narrowing down your model choices.
