# Machine Learning Model Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to introduce four machine learning models and outline the evaluation techniques used to analyze them. It also provides guidance on how to interpret the outcomes of these evaluation techniques to exclude certain models.

## Machine Learning Models

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation. The simplicity of this model makes it a popular choice for predicting continuous outcomes.

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - The Support Vector Machine is a powerful and versatile supervised learning model commonly used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes in high-dimensional space.

3. **Elastic Net Regression**
   - Elastic Net Regression combines the penalties of both Ridge and Lasso regressions, making it suitable for handling datasets with highly correlated features. It is useful for feature selection and regularizing complex models to enhance prediction accuracy.

4. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
   - Linear Discriminant Analysis is a classification method that projects data into a lower-dimensional space, emphasizing class separability. It works well when class distributions are normal and have similar covariances.

## Evaluation Techniques

### 1. Evaluate Explained Variance Score
- The Explained Variance Score indicates how well a model captures the data's variance. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values suggesting that the model better captures data variability.

  **Outcomes:**
  - Score between 0.0 and 0.3: Rule out **Linear Discriminant Analysis**.

### 2. Analyze Learning Curve
- Learning curves graphically represent a modelâ€™s performance on training and validation datasets over iterative training epochs. They are useful for diagnosing underfitting or overfitting issues.

  **Outcomes:**
  - Underfitting: Rule out **Linear Regression**.

### 3. Evaluate Feature Importances
- Assessing feature importance helps in understanding which features contribute the most to the predictive power of the model. This technique is particularly relevant for models that provide explicit information about coefficients or weights.

  **Outcomes:**
  - Feature Importance Not Available: Rule out **Support Vector Machine**.

### 4. Assess Sparsity
- Sparsity evaluation checks whether a model tends to use a limited subset of features (sparse) or incorporates many (dense). Sparse models often indicate better simplicity and interpretability.

  **Outcomes:**
  - Dense Model: Rule out **Support Vector Machine**.

### 5. Check Normality of Residuals
- This evaluation tests whether the residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) of the model follow a normal distribution. Non-normal residuals may indicate model inadequacies.

  **Outcomes:**
  - Non-normal Residuals: Rule out **Linear Regression**.

### 6. Compute F1 Score
- The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, crucial for evaluating classification models, especially when class distributions are imbalanced.

  **Outcomes:**
  - Score between 0.6 and 0.9: Rule out **Support Vector Machine**.

This guide helps you use these evaluation techniques to systematically eliminate certain machine learning models based on observed outcomes, leading to a more refined model selection process. Each model and evaluation technique discussed here is a useful tool in your machine learning toolkit, and understanding their interactions allows for more informed decision-making in model fitting and selection.
