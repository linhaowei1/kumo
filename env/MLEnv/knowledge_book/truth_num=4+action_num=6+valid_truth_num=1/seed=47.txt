# Machine Learning Model Analysis Guidebook

In this guidebook, we introduce several machine learning models and evaluation techniques. Through these methods, you can evaluate the performance of various models and make informed decisions about which ones to exclude based on specific evaluation outcomes. Here are the models and evaluation techniques we will explore:

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Ridge Regression
Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that includes an L2 regularization term. This regularization helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients, making it suitable for datasets with multicollinearity.

### 2. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Support Vector Regression is a type of Support Vector Machine (SVM) that uses the same principles for regression tasks. It aims to find a hyperplane that best fits the data by minimizing the error within a specified threshold.

### 3. Multi-label Classification Models
Multi-label classification involves predicting multiple labels for each instance. This approach is useful when decisions are not mutually exclusive, and a single instance can belong to multiple categories.

### 4. Decision Tree
Decision Trees are simple yet powerful models that split data into branches based on feature conditions. They are intuitive and easy to visualize, but can be prone to overfitting without proper tuning.

## Evaluation Techniques

### Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Squared Error measures the average of the squares of the errorsâ€”that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. It's a common metric for regression models.

- **Outcome Rulings:**
  - When MSE is between 10.0 and 20.0, *Rule Out*: Ridge Regression
  - When MSE is between 20.0 and 100.0, *Rule Out*: Support Vector Regression

### Compute R-squared Score
The R-squared Score indicates how well the independent variables explain the variance of the dependent variable. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher score indicates a better fit.

- **Outcome Rulings:**
  - When R-squared is between 0.3 and 0.7, *Rule Out*: Ridge Regression

### Evaluate Coverage Error
Coverage Error measures the average number of labels that need to be included in the prediction to ensure all true labels are covered. Lower scores are preferable.

- **Outcome Rulings:**
  - When coverage error is between 2.0 and 10.0, *Rule Out*: Multi-label Classification Models

### Calculate AUC (Area Under the Curve)
AUC measures the ability of a model to distinguish between classes and is used for binary classification problems. An AUC of 0.5 suggests a model with no discrimination ability (random guessing), while a value close to 1 indicates high performance.

- **Outcome Rulings:**
  - When AUC is between 0.5 and 0.7, *Rule Out*: Decision Tree

### Compute F1 Score
The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and is particularly meaningful in scenarios where a balance between precision and recall is desired.

- **Outcome Rulings:**
  - When F1 Score is between 0.0 and 0.6, *Rule Out*: Decision Tree

### Compute Precision
Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions, showing the proportion of true positive observations against all positive predictions.

- **Outcome Rulings:**
  - When Precision is between 0.5 and 0.8, *Rule Out*: Decision Tree

This guidebook provides a methodical approach to evaluating machine learning models through exclusion based on specific outcomes of the evaluation techniques. By applying these criteria, you can focus more efficiently on models that likely perform well given your specific dataset and problem context.
