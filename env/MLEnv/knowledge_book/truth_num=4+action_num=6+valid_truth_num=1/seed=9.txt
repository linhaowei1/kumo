# Machine Learning Model Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to introduce a set of machine learning models and evaluation techniques, along with the understanding of specific conditions under which certain models can be ruled out based on observed outcomes. The models considered here are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Neural Network, Ridge Regression, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The evaluation techniques include varying performance metrics and criteria, which help in ruling out models that do not fit particular results.

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms a set of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. It is primarily used for feature reduction and data visualization.

### 2. Neural Network
A Neural Network is a computational model inspired by the functioning of the human brain. It consists of interconnected neurons (or nodes) organized in layers, used for pattern recognition and classification tasks. Neural Networks are particularly useful for handling complex and non-linear data patterns.

### 3. Ridge Regression
Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that includes an L2 regularization term to prevent overfitting. It is used when there are multicollinearity issues in the data. The regularization term adds a penalty to the regression coefficients to shrink them towards zero, thereby stabilizing the solution.

### 4. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
Linear Discriminant Analysis is a classification technique that aims to find the linear combination of features that best separate two or more classes. It is often used in scenarios where classifying data into predefined categories is required.

## Evaluation Techniques

### 1. Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Squared Error measures the average squared difference between observed and predicted values. A lower MSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

- **When MSE is between 10.0 and 20.0:** Rule out *Ridge Regression*.

### 2. Evaluate Explained Variance Score
The Explained Variance Score quantifies how much of the variance in the target variable is captured by the model. A score closer to 1 implies better model performance.

- **When the score is between 0.0 and 0.3:** Rule out *Principal Component Analysis* and *Linear Discriminant Analysis*.

### 3. Evaluate Memory Usage
Memory Usage pertains to the amount of system memory consumed by a model during training or inference. Efficient memory use is critical for handling large datasets or when running on resource-constrained systems.

- **When memory usage is between 1,000 and 1,000,000 units:** Rule out *Neural Network*.

### 4. Compute Adjusted R-squared
Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that accounts for the number of predictors in the model. It provides a more accurate measure of model performance in handling additional predictor variables.

- **When Adjusted R-squared is between 0.2 and 0.5:** Rule out *Ridge Regression*.

### 5. Analyze Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
Partial Dependence Plots visualize the relationship between a subset of features and the predicted outcome, helping to interpret the model's response.

- **When a complex relationship is observed:** Rule out *Neural Network*.

### 6. Perform Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter Tuning involves optimizing the configuration parameters of the model to improve its generalization performance.

- **When the model never converges during hyperparameter tuning:** Rule out *Neural Network*.

## Conclusion

In applying these evaluations, when specific outcomes are observed, certain models are ruled out as unsuitable. This structured approach ensures that the best model for the given data and context is identified effectively. By understanding these models and evaluations, one can make informed decisions and achieve greater precision in machine learning projects.
