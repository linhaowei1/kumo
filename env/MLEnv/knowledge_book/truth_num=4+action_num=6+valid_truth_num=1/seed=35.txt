# Machine Learning Model Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an introduction to a selection of machine learning (ML) models and the evaluation techniques used to analyze them. The focus is on understanding when certain models should be excluded based on evaluation outcomes. Here, we discuss four ML models—Decision Tree, Random Forest, Random Guess Model, and Gradient Boosting Machine—and evaluate them using six techniques: Evaluate Memory Usage, Perform Sensitivity Analysis, Assess Overfitting, Perform Hyperparameter Tuning, Measure Computational Time, and Compute Precision.

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Decision Tree

A Decision Tree is a model that uses a tree-like structure to make decisions based on a series of rules. These rules are derived from the features of the data, and each node in the tree represents a decision point. Decision Trees are intuitive and easy to interpret.

### 2. Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of their predictions. It attempts to improve the predictive accuracy and control overfitting by using a majority vote mechanism.

### 3. Random Guess Model

A Random Guess Model is a baseline approach that makes predictions based on random chance. This model serves as a control to compare other models against a guess scenario.

### 4. Gradient Boosting Machine

Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is another ensemble method that builds models sequentially. Each model attempts to correct the errors made by the previous models, optimizing the results through a gradient descent algorithm.

## Evaluation Techniques

### 1. Evaluate Memory Usage

Memory usage is an important consideration in model selection, especially with large datasets. Models that consume excessive memory may not be practical for certain applications. 

- **Rule-out Outcome:** 
  - If memory usage falls between 1,000 and 1,000,000, exclude Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine.

### 2. Perform Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis assesses how sensitive a model's output is to changes in input. This can highlight which models are more stable or prone to fluctuation.

- **Rule-out Outcome:**
  - If a model is sensitive to input changes, exclude Decision Tree.

### 3. Assess Overfitting

Overfitting happens when a model learns the noise in the training data rather than the actual signal, resulting in poor generalization to new data.

- **Rule-out Outcome:** 
  - If overfitting is detected, exclude Random Forest and Decision Tree.

### 4. Perform Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting model parameters to find an optimal set that improves performance.

- **Rule-out Outcome:**
  - If tuning never converged, exclude Gradient Boosting Machine.
  - If overfitting is detected after tuning, exclude Decision Tree.

### 5. Measure Computational Time

Computational time measures how long a model takes to train and make predictions, which can impact the feasibility of its use in real-time applications.

- **Rule-out Outcome:** 
  - If computational time is between 10 and 100 units, exclude Random Forest.

### 6. Compute Precision

Precision evaluates the accuracy of positive predictions made by a model. Higher precision means fewer false positives.

- **Rule-out Outcome:** 
  - If precision falls between 0.5 and 0.8, exclude Random Forest and Decision Tree.

## Conclusion

In summary, this guidebook outlines how to effectively analyze different ML models using specified evaluation techniques. By understanding these techniques and their impact on excluding specific models, practitioners can make more informed decisions in model selection to ensure robust and efficient ML applications.
