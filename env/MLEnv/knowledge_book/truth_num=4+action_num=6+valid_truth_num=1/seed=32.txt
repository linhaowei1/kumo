# Machine Learning Model Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an overview of selected machine learning (ML) models and their evaluation techniques. The focus is on understanding how various evaluations can rule out specific models from further consideration based on their outcomes.

## ML Models

### 1. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Support Vector Regression is a type of Support Vector Machine used for regression tasks. It works by finding the best hyperplane that can predict continuous values while maintaining a certain tolerance for errors.

### 2. GPT Model
The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) Model is a language model that generates human-like text. It is based on transformer architecture and is commonly evaluated using metrics like BLEU score to assess its text generation quality.

### 3. Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
Gradient Boosting Machine is an ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to correct the errors of prior models. It is particularly powerful for dealing with complex relationships in data but can be prone to overfitting if not properly tuned.

### 4. Lasso Regression
Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression that applies L1 regularization. It helps in feature selection by driving coefficients of less important features to zero, which can lead to more interpretable models.

## Evaluation Techniques

### 1. Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Squared Error is a common regression evaluation metric that measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the observed actual outcomes and the outcomes predicted by the model.

- **Outcome Ruling Out:**
  - MSE in the range 10.0 to 20.0 rules out **Lasso Regression**.
  - MSE in the range 20.0 to 100.0 rules out **Support Vector Regression**.

### 2. Test for Convergence
Testing for convergence involves verifying whether an iterative process within the model fitting has successfully minimized the error to an acceptable level.

- **Outcome Ruling Out:**
  - If the process did not converge, it rules out **Gradient Boosting Machine**.

### 3. Perform Stability Selection
Stability Selection is used to identify which features consistently appear in the model after accounting for random variation. It’s valuable in understanding model robustness.

- **Outcome Ruling Out:**
  - If features selected are unstable, it rules out **Lasso Regression**.

### 4. Evaluate BLEU Score
BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is a metric for evaluating the quality of text generated by models like the GPT, by comparing them to reference texts.

- **Outcome Ruling Out:**
  - BLEU Score in the range 0.0 to 0.3 rules out **GPT Model**.

### 5. Analyze Partial Dependence Plots
Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) help visualize the effect of a specific feature on the predicted outcome of a model across its range while marginalizing over the values of all other input features.

- **Outcome Ruling Out:**
  - A complex relationship in PDPs rules out **Gradient Boosting Machine**.

### 6. Perform Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter Tuning is the process of optimizing the parameters that govern the learning process of an ML model in order to improve performance.

- **Outcome Ruling Out:**
  - If never converged during tuning, it rules out **Gradient Boosting Machine**.

## Summary

When evaluating machine learning models, you can systematically eliminate models based on specific evaluation outcomes. Understanding which models behave in certain ways under given evaluations ensures more targeted and effective model selection. By applying the aforementioned rules, decision-makers can focus on models that are most likely to succeed for their specific use cases.
