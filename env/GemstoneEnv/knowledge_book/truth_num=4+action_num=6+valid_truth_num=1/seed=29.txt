# Guidebook: Identifying Real Gemstones Among Synthetic Ones

Gemstones possess unique characteristics that allow us to distinguish between real and synthetic variations. This guidebook will outline specific tests used to identify real Opal, Kunzite, Unakite, and Demantoid Garnet from synthetic counterparts. Each test focuses on observable outcomes that exclude or rule out particular gemstones based on the results. Therefore, understanding which gemstones are not the test subject upon various test outcomes will guide you to determine real gemstones accurately.

## Gemstones Overview

### 1. Opal
- **Appearance:** Known for its flashy play-of-color and unique patterning.
  
### 2. Kunzite
- **Appearance:** Typically pink to purple with variable clarity.
  
### 3. Unakite
- **Appearance:** Recognizable by its green and pink mottled pattern.
  
### 4. Demantoid Garnet
- **Appearance:** Vibrant green hue, often with horsetail inclusions.

## Test Descriptions and Analysis

### 1. UV Fluorescence Check
The UV Fluorescence Check involves exposing the gemstone to ultraviolet light to observe its fluorescence.

- **No Fluorescence:** Rule out Opal.
- **Weak Fluorescence:** Rule out Kunzite.
- **Strong Fluorescence:** Does not rule out any specific gemstone.

### 2. Specific Gravity Test
Specific Gravity measures the density of the gemstone compared to water.

- **Range (2.0 – 3.0):** Does not rule out any specified gemstone.
- **Range (3.0 – 4.0):** Rule out Opal.
- **Range (4.0 – 7.0):** Rule out Opal, Kunzite, and Unakite.

### 3. Chelsea Filter Test
This test uses a special filter to observe color changes under specific lighting.

- **Red or Pink:** Rule out Opal, Unakite, and Kunzite.
- **Green or No Change:** Rule out Demantoid Garnet.

### 4. Heft Test
The Heft Test determines tactile weight when compared to similarly-sized stones.

- **Feels Heavy:** Rule out Opal, Unakite, and Kunzite.
- **Feels Light:** Does not rule out any specific gemstone.

### 5. Spectroscope Analysis
A tool that examines the light spectrum emitted or absorbed by the gemstone.

- **Chromium Lines Present:** Rule out Opal, Unakite, and Kunzite.
- **Iron Lines Present:** Rule out Opal, Unakite, and Kunzite.
- **No Significant Lines:** Does not rule out any specific gemstone.

### 6. Optic Sign Test
Examines how light passes through the gemstone to determine its optical characteristics.

- **Uniaxial:** Rule out Opal, Unakite, and Kunzite.
- **Biaxial:** Does not rule out any specific gemstone.

## Conclusion

By conducting the above tests and paying attention to the described outcomes, it becomes possible to determine which of the listed gemstones might still be considered a candidate for being genuine. Observing the right tests and applying the process of elimination as outlined ensures accurate gemstone identification. By ruling out incorrect options through mismatches with test observations, you can confidently proceed towards identifying authentic gemstones. Use this guide as a framework to navigate the subtle distinctions between real and synthetic stones effectively.
