# Guidebook for Identifying Real Gemstones Among Synthetics

In this guide, we will walk through various tests you can perform to differentiate real gemstones from synthetic ones. We're focusing on four popular gemstones: **Kyanite, Amethyst, Moonstone, and Rose Quartz**. By understanding how these stones react to different tests, you can effectively rule out fake stones. Let's proceed with clear instructions and explanations.

## Understanding the Gemstones

- **Kyanite**: Known for its deep blue color, Kyanite is often used in jewelry and is prized for its unique properties.
  
- **Amethyst**: This purple variety of quartz is highly popular and cherished for its beauty and supposed calming properties.

- **Moonstone**: Famous for its shimmering appearance reminiscent of moonlight, this gemstone is highly coveted in jewelry.

- **Rose Quartz**: A pink variety of quartz, Rose Quartz is known for its gentle color and is associated with love and healing.

## Conducting Gemstone Tests

### 1. **Dichroscope Test**

#### Purpose
To observe pleochroism, where a gemstone shows different colors when viewed from different angles.

#### Outcomes:
- **Pleochroism Observed**: If the gemstone displays different colors, **Rose Quartz**, **Amethyst**, and **Moonstone** can be ruled out.
  
- **No Pleochroism**: If no color change is observed, **Kyanite** can be ruled out.

### 2. **Heft Test**

#### Purpose
To assess the weight of the gemstone by feeling it in the hand.

#### Outcomes:
- **Feels Heavy**: If the stone feels heavy, **Kyanite**, **Rose Quartz**, **Amethyst**, and **Moonstone** can be ruled out.
  
- **Feels Light**: No gemstones are ruled out based on this outcome alone.

### 3. **Optic Sign Test**

#### Purpose
To determine the optic nature of the gemstone (uniaxial or biaxial).

#### Outcomes:
- **Uniaxial**: If the stone displays uniaxial optic properties, **Kyanite**, **Rose Quartz**, **Amethyst**, and **Moonstone** can be ruled out.
  
- **Biaxial**: Since no biaxial gemstones are considered here, a biaxial result suggests synthetic or different natural stones, effectively ruling out all four gemstones.

### 4. **Thermal Conductivity Test**

#### Purpose
To measure how well the gemstone conducts heat.

#### Outcomes:
- **High Conductivity**: If high conductivity is observed, **Kyanite**, **Rose Quartz**, **Amethyst**, and **Moonstone** can be ruled out.
  
- **Low Conductivity**: No gemstones are ruled out based on this outcome alone.

### 5. **Heat Resistance Test**

#### Purpose
To check if the gemstone can withstand heat without damage.

#### Outcomes:
- **Resistant**: If the stone resists heat, **Kyanite**, **Rose Quartz**, **Amethyst**, and **Moonstone** can be ruled out.
  
- **Not Resistant**: No gemstones are ruled out based on this outcome alone.

### 6. **Fracture Observation**

#### Purpose
To observe the texture of the gemstone's fracture.

#### Outcomes:
- **Even Fracture**: If an even fracture is observed, **Kyanite**, **Rose Quartz**, **Amethyst**, and **Moonstone** can be ruled out.
  
- **Uneven Fracture**: No gemstones are ruled out based on this outcome alone.

## Conclusion

By following these tests and reviewing the outcomes, you can methodically eliminate real gemstones from your selection, helping you identify synthetic alternatives. Remember, each test serves to rule out certain gemstones based on their specific properties. Therefore, understanding the typical reactions of Kyanite, Amethyst, Moonstone, and Rose Quartz is crucial in making a well-informed distinction. Accurate observations and the application of multiple tests complement one another for the best results in identifying fake gemstones.
