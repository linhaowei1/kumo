# Analysis Guidebook: Identifying Real Gemstones Among Synthetic Ones

Welcome to your guidebook for distinguishing real gemstones from synthetic copies. This guide focuses on four specific gemstones: Smoky Quartz, Iolite, Malachite, and Obsidian. To help you identify genuine stones, we'll walk you through a series of tests and explain how the outcomes can tell you what’s synthetic or what's potentially real. Your goal is to systematically rule out options based on these observations.

### 1. Understanding the Gemstones

**Smoky Quartz:** This is a crystalline variety of quartz known for its smokiness ranging from light grey to deep brown.

**Iolite:** A gemstone known for its pleochroism, which means it can show different colors when viewed from different angles—mainly violet-blue.

**Malachite:** Well-known for its vibrant green color, malachite usually forms in botryoidal (grape-like), fibrous, or stalactitic masses.

**Obsidian:** A naturally occurring volcanic glass, typically black, with a smooth, glassy texture.

### 2. Conducting the Tests

#### **Dichroscope Test**
This test checks for pleochroism, the ability to show different colors from different angles.

- **Pleochroism Observed (Smoky Quartz, Malachite):** If you see multiple colors, rule out Smoky Quartz and Malachite.
- **No Pleochroism (Iolite):** If a single color is visible regardless of the angle, rule out Iolite.

#### **Heat Resistance Test**
This examines how the stone reacts to heat exposure.

- **Resistant (Smoky Quartz, Iolite):** When the gemstone withstands heat without damage, exclude Malachite.
- **Not Resistant (Malachite):** If the stone doesn't resist heat, rule out Smoky Quartz and Iolite.

#### **Surface Analysis**
Analyzing the fractures can offer insight into the gemstone's nature.

- **Conchoidal Fracture (Smoky Quartz, Malachite, Iolite):** If the stone has smooth curved breaks like glass, exclude Obsidian.
- **Uneven Fracture (Obsidian):** An uneven texture means ruling out Malachite, Smoky Quartz, and Iolite.

#### **Crystal Habit Observation**
Determines the overall shape and habit of the gemstone's crystal formation.

- **Cubic (Smoky Quartz, Malachite, Iolite):** Observing a cubic shape? Discount Obsidian.
- **Hexagonal (None):** If you observe a hexagonal habit, something is off—it’s likely not among our focus gemstones.

#### **Cleavage Test**
This test refers to how easily a gemstone can split along specific planes.

- **Perfect Cleavage (Smoky Quartz, Malachite, Iolite):** A perfect split suggests excluding Obsidian.
- **Imperfect or None (None):** Stones left un-cleaved are potentially not part of our gemstone group.

#### **Phosphorescence Test**
Checks if the stone glows after removing a light source.

- **Phosphorescent (Smoky Quartz, Malachite, Iolite):** If it shows phosphorescence, exclude Obsidian.
- **Not Phosphorescent (None):** Absence of this glow isn't helpful in ruling out any of the genuine stones further.

### Conclusion

By methodically applying each test and ruling out stones based on the outcomes, you can effectively distinguish between real and synthetic gemstones. For each observation, dismiss those gemstones listed under the outcomes not aligned with what you've tested and observed. Following these steps with attention to detail will guide you in identifying genuine gemstones. Enjoy the fascinating journey of gemstone analysis!
