# Gemstone Analysis Guide: Identifying Real Gemstones from Synthetic Ones

This guidebook provides a structured approach to determining whether a gemstone is real or synthetic by leveraging a variety of tests and analyses. You'll be using a process of elimination to identify potential real gemstones by ruling out those that do not meet specific criteria.

## Gemstones Overview
1. **Aquamarine**: A bluish-green gem from the beryl family known for its clarity and distinctive hue.
2. **Spinel**: A durable gemstone often mistaken for ruby or sapphire, noted for a wide range of colors.
3. **Obsidian**: A volcanic glass with a smooth, glossy surface, usually black or dark green.
4. **Morganite**: A pink to orange-pink gemstone within the beryl family, admired for its delicate color.

## Tests and Rule-Out Guidelines

### 1. UV Fluorescence Check
- **No Fluorescence**: Excludes Spinel. Any gemstone that shows no fluorescence could be Aquamarine or Morganite.
- **Weak Fluorescence**: Excludes Morganite and Aquamarine. Weak fluorescence suggests the possibility of Spinel or Obsidian.
- **Strong Fluorescence**: Excludes no gemstones; no gemstone exhibits strong fluorescence typically.

### 2. Surface Analysis
- **Conchoidal Fracture**: Excludes Morganite, Spinel, and Aquamarine. If you observe this type of fracture, the gemstone could be Obsidian.
- **Uneven Fracture**: Excludes Obsidian. This observation points towards Spinel, Aquamarine, or Morganite.

### 3. Polariscope Test
- **Isotropic**: Excludes Morganite and Aquamarine. This outcome implies the gemstone could be Spinel or Obsidian.
- **Anisotropic**: Excludes Spinel. This indicates the gemstone could be Aquamarine or Morganite.

### 4. Optic Sign Test
- **Uniaxial**: Excludes no gemstones; Spinel, Aquamarine, and Morganite can all be uniaxial.
- **Biaxial**: Excludes Spinel, Aquamarine, and Morganite. This observation does not typically apply to the listed gemstones.

### 5. Infrared Spectroscopy
- **Characteristic Peaks**: Excludes Morganite, Spinel, and Aquamarine. Since all have characteristic peaks, observing them suggests ruling out these gemstones.
- **No Characteristic Peaks**: Excludes no gemstones; however, since all listed gemstones have characteristic peaks, this outcome is contradictory and may indicate an unknown or different gemstone.

### 6. Color Filter Test
- **Red Filter Response**: Excludes Morganite, Spinel, and Aquamarine. This test checks for color changes that all can exhibit, so observing a response suggests ruling them out.
- **Green Filter Response**: Excludes Morganite, Spinel, and Aquamarine. Similar applicability as the red filter.
- **No Change**: Excludes Morganite, Spinel, and Aquamarine. A mandatory color change suggests the gemstone is of concern.

## Conclusion

With the tests and guidelines outlined, you can systematically analyze a gemstone by ruling out ineligible varieties. Follow each test's explanation to eliminate options based on their results. Remember, the process relies on exclusion; as mismatches appear, options narrow, leaving you with potential real gemstones. Adjust your observations according to real-world conditions, as test environments can vary.
