# Guidebook for Identifying Real Gemstones from Synthetic Ones

This guidebook provides simple and clear methods to distinguish real gemstones from synthetic ones using several tests. We will focus on four types of gemstones: Zircon, Rhodochrosite, Labradorite, and Tanzanite. Each test listed can help rule out certain gemstones depending on the observed results. 

### Gemstones Overview

1. **Zircon**: Known for its high brilliance and fire, often confused with diamonds. Zircon is a relatively hard gemstone.
2. **Rhodochrosite**: Recognizable by its pink to red hues and banded appearance, this gemstone is sensitive to acids and has moderate hardness.
3. **Labradorite**: Famous for its colorful play of light (labradorescence), this gemstone doesn't react with acids and has lower hardness.
4. **Tanzanite**: An exclusive gemstone distinguished by its vibrant blue to violet colors, it also doesn't react with acids and possesses moderate hardness.

### Tests to Differentiate Gemstones

#### 1. Acid Reaction Test
- **Outcome**: 
  - **Reacts to Acid**: Rule out `Rhodochrosite` (it will react to acid).
  - **No Reaction**: Rule out `Tanzanite`, `Labradorite`, `Zircon` (these don't react to acid).

#### 2. Phosphorescence Test
- **Outcome**:
  - **Phosphorescent**: All four gemstones (`Tanzanite`, `Rhodochrosite`, `Labradorite`, `Zircon`) will appear phosphorescent. Therefore, in this scenario, no gemstones can be ruled out.

#### 3. Color Filter Test
- **Outcome**:
  - **Red Filter Response**: All gemstones react to red filters the same way, thus not providing a basis to rule any out.
  - **Green Filter Response**: Similar to the red filter response, all gemstones react the same, so none are ruled out.

#### 4. Infrared Spectroscopy
- **Outcome**:
  - **Characteristic Peaks**: All gemstones (`Tanzanite`, `Rhodochrosite`, `Labradorite`, `Zircon`) show characteristic peaks in infrared spectroscopy, which means this test alone will not exclude any gemstones.

#### 5. Hardness Test
- **Outcome**:
  - **(1.0, 5.0) Hardness**: Rule out `Zircon` as it falls within this range.
  - **(5.0, 7.0) Hardness**: Rule out `Zircon`.
  - **(7.0, 10.0) Hardness**: Rule out `Rhodochrosite`.

#### 6. Dispersion Measurement
- **Outcome**:
  - **(0.045, 0.065) Dispersion**: Each gemstone (`Tanzanite`, `Rhodochrosite`, `Labradorite`, `Zircon`) measures within this range.
  - **(0.065, 0.1) Dispersion**: This range also includes all the gemstones, so no specific exclusions can be made solely through dispersion measurement.

### Conclusion

Use this guide in combination when conducting tests. By effectively observing each test's results, you can systematically rule out certain gemstones. The combination of these tests enhances your accuracy and confidence in distinguishing real gemstones from synthetics. Always cross-reference results and consider employing multiple tests for reliable identification.
