# Guidebook for Identifying Real Gemstones Among Synthetic Ones

If you are looking to identify real gemstones from synthetic ones, you will need to conduct several tests. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you understand each gemstone and test, as well as interpret the outcomes to rule out synthetic options.

## Gemstones Overview

1. **Peridot**: A beautiful green gemstone often mistaken for emerald.
2. **Topaz**: Known for its range of colors, Topaz can be clear, yellow, or blue.
3. **Moonstone**: Characterized by its mesmerizing, soft glow.
4. **Ruby**: A famous red gemstone associated with royalty and love.

## Tests for Identifying Gemstones

We will utilize several tests to identify whether the gemstones are real or synthetic. Understanding the results of these tests will help in ruling out synthetic options.

### 1. Spectroscope Analysis

The spectroscope test helps to analyze the light spectrum of a gemstone.

- **Chromium Lines**: If you observe chromium lines, rule out Peridot, Topaz, and Moonstone.
- **Iron Lines**: If iron lines are present, exclude Topaz, Ruby, and Moonstone.
- **No Significant Lines**: If no significant lines appear, dismiss Peridot and Ruby.

### 2. Phosphorescence Test

This test checks if the gemstone exhibits light remnants after being exposed to a light source.

- **Phosphorescent**: If the gemstone shows phosphorescence, rule out Peridot, Topaz, Ruby, and Moonstone.
- **Not Phosphorescent**: This outcome does not rule out any gemstones in our list.

### 3. Dispersion Measurement

Dispersion is about how the gemstone splits light into its component colors, resulting in a colorful display.

- **0.0 to 0.015**: If dispersion is within this range, exclude Peridot.
- **0.015 to 0.045**: If dispersion is within this range, exclude Topaz and Ruby.
- **0.045 to 0.065**: If dispersion is within this range, exclude Peridot, Topaz, Ruby, and Moonstone.
- **0.065 to 0.1**: If dispersion is within this range, exclude Peridot, Topaz, Ruby, and Moonstone.

### 4. Chelsea Filter Test

This involves using a Chelsea filter to observe changes in color under specific lighting.

- **Red or Pink Change**: If the gemstone appears red or pink, rule out Peridot, Topaz, Ruby, and Moonstone.
- **Green or No Change**: This outcome does not rule out any gemstones in our list.

### 5. Fracture Observation

Fracture observation examines how a gemstone breaks.

- **Even Fracture**: If the gemstone exhibits an even fracture, rule out Peridot, Topaz, Ruby, and Moonstone.
- **Uneven Fracture**: This outcome does not rule out any gemstones in our list.

### 6. Polariscope Test

The Polariscope is used to determine whether a gemstone is isotropic or anisotropic.

- **Isotropic**: If the gemstone is isotropic, rule out Peridot, Topaz, Ruby, and Moonstone.
- **Anisotropic**: This outcome does not rule out any gemstones in our list.

## Conclusion

By conducting these tests and carefully interpreting their outcomes, you can effectively rule out synthetic gemstones. Remember, the idea is to rule out what doesnâ€™t fit; thus, you are narrowing the field to potential real gemstones. Always ensure to handle gemstones carefully and conduct tests in a suitable workspace.
