# Guidebook for Identifying Real Gemstones from Synthetic Ones

This guidebook provides a systematic approach to help you identify real gemstones among synthetic ones by conducting specific tests. In this guide, we focus on a set of gemstones: Lapis Lazuli, Monazite, Gold Nugget, and the Quartz family. Each test will help determine which gemstones to **rule out** based on the results obtained, allowing you to narrow down your options effectively.

## Overview of Gemstones and Tests

### Gemstones:

1. **Lapis Lazuli**: Known for its deep blue color, this gemstone is typically relatively heavy and has unique fracturing properties.
   
2. **Monazite**: A mineral often containing notable radioactivity due to its thorium content.
   
3. **Gold Nugget**: Commonly found in a metallic form, gold nuggets tend to be denser and heavier compared to other gemstones.
   
4. **Quartz Family**: Includes varieties such as amethyst and citrine, generally characterized by a lighter weight and diverse colors.

### Tests:

1. **Heft Test**: Measures the perceived weight of the gemstone in the hand to determine if it feels heavy or light.
   
2. **Radioactivity Test**: Detects the level of radioactivity in a sample, identifying minerals that emit radiation.
   
3. **Dispersion Measurement**: Analyzes how light is dispersed or split into different colors by the gemstone.
   
4. **Ultraviolet Absorption Test**: Observes the level of absorption when the gemstone is exposed to ultraviolet light.
   
5. **Chelsea Filter Test**: Uses a special filter to observe changes in color, helping to distinguish certain minerals.
   
6. **Surface Analysis**: Examines the type of fractures present on the gemstone's surface.

## Analysis Procedures and Rule-Out Outcomes

### 1. Heft Test

- **Feels Heavy**:
  - **Rule out**: Lapis Lazuli

- **Feels Light**:
  - **Rule out**: Gold Nugget

### 2. Radioativity Test

- **Radioactive**:
  - **Rule out**: Monazite

- **Non-Radioactive**:
  - **Rule out**: Lapis Lazuli

### 3. Dispersion Measurement

- **Dispersion Range 0.0 - 0.015**:
  - **Rule out**: Quartz family

- **Dispersion Range 0.045 - 0.065**:
  - **Rule out**: Lapis Lazuli

- **Dispersion Range 0.065 - 0.1**:
  - **Rule out**: Lapis Lazuli

### 4. Ultraviolet Absorption Test

- **Strong Absorption**:
  - **Rule out**: Lapis Lazuli

- **Weak or No Absorption**:
  - **Rule out**: None

### 5. Chelsea Filter Test

- **Red or Pink Observation**:
  - **Rule out**: Lapis Lazuli

- **Green or No Change**:
  - **Rule out**: None

### 6. Surface Analysis

- **Conchoidal Fracture**:
  - **Rule out**: Lapis Lazuli

- **Uneven Fracture**:
  - **Rule out**: Quartz family

## Conclusion

By following these tests and examining the outcomes, you can systematically eliminate synthetic or incorrect options, thereby honing in on the real gemstone you possess. Each test is designed to exclude certain gemstones based on test results, narrowing down the possibilities to identify the genuine article accurately. Always handle gemstones carefully and consult professional gemological resources for confirmation when necessary.
