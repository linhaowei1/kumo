## Guidebook to Identifying Real Gemstones Among Synthetic Ones

In this guidebook, we will explore how to differentiate between real and synthetic gemstones using various identification tests. Our focus will be on four gemstones: Diopside, Spinel, Zoisite, and Citrine. For each gemstone, certain tests can help determine whether it is real or synthetic. We will discuss these tests and their possible outcomes and explain how to rule out certain gemstones based on these results.

### Overview of the Gemstones

1. **Diopside**: Known for its vibrant green color, diopside features a high birefringence and even fractures.

2. **Spinel**: This gemstone can be found in a range of colors and is valued for its brilliance and vibrancy. Spinels typically show even fractures and low hardness compared to other gemstones.

3. **Zoisite**: Often recognized by its appearance in tanzanite form, zoisite can exhibit a range of colors from blue to violet.

4. **Citrine**: A variety of quartz, citrine is renowned for its yellow to orange hues and generally demonstrates stable optical properties.

### Tests to Differentiate the Gemstones

We perform several tests to help identify and rule out synthetic gemstones.

#### 1. Polariscope Test

- **Isotropic**: If a gemstone is isotropic, it does not alter the light passed through it in different directions. This outcome **rules out Diopside, Zoisite, and Citrine**.
  
- **Anisotropic**: If a gemstone alters light, it's anisotropic. This outcome **rules out Spinel**.

#### 2. Birefringence Test

- **High Birefringence**: This indicates the gemstone splits light into two rays. This outcome **rules out Citrine, Diopside, Spinel, and Zoisite**.
  
- **Low or None**: This outcome does not rule out any of the listed gemstones.

#### 3. Fracture Observation

- **Even Fracture**: Observing an even fracture **rules out Citrine, Diopside, Spinel, and Zoisite**.
  
- **Uneven Fracture**: This outcome does not rule out any of the listed gemstones.

#### 4. Optic Sign Test

- **Uniaxial**: This outcome **rules out Citrine, Diopside, Spinel, and Zoisite**.
  
- **Biaxial**: This outcome does not rule out any of the listed gemstones.

#### 5. Phosphorescence Test

- **Phosphorescent**: The presence of a visible glow after the light source is removed **rules out Citrine, Diopside, Spinel, and Zoisite**.
  
- **Not Phosphorescent**: This outcome does not rule out any of the listed gemstones.

#### 6. Hardness Test

- **Hardness Range (1.0 - 5.0)**: Observing this softness **rules out Spinel**.
  
- **Hardness Range (5.0 - 7.0)**: Observing this range **rules out Spinel**.
  
- **Hardness Range (7.0 - 10.0)**: This outcome does not rule out any of the listed gemstones.

### Conclusion

To identify real gemstones, we focus on ruling out synthetic options using the exclusion method based on the test observations described above. Remember, this guide simplifies a complex identification process. Professionals should conduct these tests for precise and reliable results.
