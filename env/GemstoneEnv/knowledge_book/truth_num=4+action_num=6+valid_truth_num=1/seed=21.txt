# Guide to Identifying Real Gemstones Among Synthetic Ones

This guide will help you differentiate between real and synthetic gemstones. We'll focus on four gemstones: Alexandrite, Smoky Quartz, Obsidian, and Citrine. By conducting various tests, you'll rule out certain gemstones based on outcomes that don't match the natural characteristics of real gemstones. The key tests you'll perform are the Birefringence Test, Luminescence Test, Surface Analysis, Chemical Composition Analysis, Magnetism Test, and Acid Reaction Test.

## Gemstone Characteristics

1. **Alexandrite**: Known for changing color under different lighting. It is optically active and should show characteristics distinct from synthetic versions.
2. **Smoky Quartz**: A brownish variety of quartz. Smoky Quartz is typically found in nature and can be distinguished from synthetic variants through its particular properties.
3. **Obsidian**: A volcanic glass, naturally occurring and non-crystalline. It's important to distinguish it from synthetic glass using specific tests.
4. **Citrine**: A yellow to reddish-orange variety of quartz. Like Smoky Quartz, it's naturally occurring, and knowing its distinct features helps identify synthetic imitations.

## Tests and Their Outcomes

### 1. Birefringence Test

**Objective**: Measure the gemstone's double refraction.

- **Outcome: High Birefringence**  
  - **Gemstones Ruled Out**: Citrine, Smoky Quartz, Alexandrite
  - **Action**: If high birefringence is observed, rule out Citrine, Smoky Quartz, and Alexandrite.

- **Outcome: Low or None**  
  - This result does not eliminate any of the gemstones.

### 2. Luminescence Test

**Objective**: Check how the gemstone emits light when exposed to UV light.

- **Outcome: Luminescent**  
  - **Gemstones Ruled Out**: Citrine, Smoky Quartz, Alexandrite
  - **Action**: If the gemstone glows under UV light, rule out Citrine, Smoky Quartz, and Alexandrite.

- **Outcome: Non-Luminescent**  
  - This result does not eliminate any of the gemstones.

### 3. Surface Analysis

**Objective**: Observe the gemstone's fracture style.

- **Outcome: Conchoidal Fracture**  
  - **Gemstones Ruled Out**: Obsidian
  - **Action**: If a conchoidal fracture is observed, rule out Obsidian.

- **Outcome: Uneven Fracture**  
  - **Gemstones Ruled Out**: Smoky Quartz, Citrine, Alexandrite
  - **Action**: If an uneven fracture is observed, rule out Smoky Quartz, Citrine, and Alexandrite, leaving only Obsidian as a candidate.

### 4. Chemical Composition Analysis

**Objective**: Determine if silicon is present.

- **Outcome: Contains Silicon**  
  - **Gemstones Ruled Out**: None
  - **Action**: If silicon is found, do not rule out Citrine or Alexandrite.

- **Outcome: Does Not Contain Silicon**  
  - **Gemstones Ruled Out**: Citrine, Alexandrite
  - **Action**: If silicon is not present, rule out Citrine and Alexandrite.

### 5. Magnetism Test

**Objective**: Assess if the gemstone shows any magnetic properties.

- **Outcome: Magnetic Attraction**  
  - **Gemstones Ruled Out**: Citrine, Smoky Quartz, Alexandrite
  - **Action**: If there is magnetic attraction, rule out Citrine, Smoky Quartz, and Alexandrite.

- **Outcome: No Magnetic Reaction**  
  - This result does not eliminate any of the gemstones.

### 6. Acid Reaction Test

**Objective**: See how the gemstone reacts to acid exposure.

- **Outcome: Reacts to Acid**  
  - **Gemstones Ruled Out**: All real gemstones (Citrine, Smoky Quartz, Alexandrite, Obsidian)
  - **Action**: If the gemstone reacts to acid, rule out all considered real gemstones.

- **Outcome: No Reaction**  
  - **Gemstones Ruled Out**: None
  - **Action**: If no reaction is observed, do not rule out Citrine, Smoky Quartz, or Alexandrite.

## Using the Guide

Conduct each test and observe the outcomes. By systematically applying these tests and outcomes, you effectively rule out synthetic gemstones based on mismatches with known real gemstone characteristics. Keep track of which gemstones remain the most plausible candidates after each test for accurate identification.
