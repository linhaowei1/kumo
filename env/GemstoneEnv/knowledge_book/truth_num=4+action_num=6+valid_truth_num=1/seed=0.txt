# Guidebook to Identifying Real Gemstones among Synthetic Ones

## Introduction

In this guidebook, we'll focus on identifying the true nature of four specific gemstones: Moonstone, Gold Nugget, Morganite, and Scheelite. We use specific tests to help you distinguish real gemstones from synthetic ones effectively and efficiently. By understanding and performing these tests, and knowing the possible outcomes, you can rule out synthetic options.

## Gemstones Overview

1. **Moonstone**: Often known for its magical, iridescent sheen. It's typically a translucent stone with unique visual properties.
   
2. **Gold Nugget**: Naturally occurring piece of native gold. Different from a gemstone but often considered precious due to its natural gold content.

3. **Morganite**: A beautiful pink to orange-pink gemstone, closely related to emerald and aquamarine.
   
4. **Scheelite**: Known for its bright fluorescence under UV light and its unique chemical composition.

## Tests and Outcomes

Understanding the tests and their outcomes is essential in determining the authenticity of the gemstones.

### 1. Heft Test
- **Feels Heavy**: If the gemstone feels heavy during this test, rule out Morganite and Moonstone.
- **Feels Light**: If the gemstone feels light, rule out Gold Nugget.

### 2. Birefringence Test
- **High Birefringence**: If you observe high birefringence, rule out Morganite and Moonstone.
- **Low or None**: This outcome does not rule out any gemstones.

### 3. Radioactivity Test
- **Radioactive**: This outcome does not rule out any gemstones.
- **Non-Radioactive**: If the gemstone is non-radioactive, rule out Morganite and Moonstone.

### 4. Ultraviolet Absorption Test
- **Strong Absorption**: If strong absorption is observed, rule out Morganite and Moonstone; synthetic options without this property can be dismissed.
- **Weak or No Absorption**: This outcome does not rule out any gemstones.

### 5. Spectroscope Analysis
- **Chromium Lines**: Presence of chromium lines means you should rule out Morganite and Moonstone and consider synthetic counterparts.
- **Iron Lines**: Similarly, the presence of iron lines requires ruling out Morganite and Moonstone.
- **No Significant Lines**: This outcome does not rule out any gemstones.

### 6. Acid Reaction Test
- **Reacts to Acid**: This outcome does not rule out any gemstones.
- **No Reaction**: If there is no reaction to acid, rule out Morganite and Moonstone.

## Conclusion

Employing these tests and understanding their outcomes helps in confidently ruling out synthetic objects based on inconsistencies with the expected behaviors of real Moonstone, Gold Nugget, Morganite, and Scheelite. Remember that eliminating options based on mismatch is key to accurately identifying genuine gemstones. Proceed with each test mindfully to ensure the best results in distinguishing between real and synthetic gemstones.
