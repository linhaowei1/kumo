# Medical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an overview of specific diseases and diagnostic tests, along with the outcomes that help rule out these diseases. For healthcare professionals, understanding the context and results of these tests can aid in the effective diagnosis and management of patients. 

## Diseases

### 1. Tuberculosis
- A bacterial infection primarily affecting the lungs, with symptoms like persistent cough, fever, and weight loss.

### 2. Bipolar Disorder
- A mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings, including emotional highs (mania) and lows (depression).

### 3. Diabetes Mellitus Type 1
- An autoimmune condition where the pancreas produces little or no insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels.

### 4. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis)
- Chronic inflammation of the colon, causing ulcers and long-lasting pain and discomfort.

### 5. Urinary Tract Infection
- Infection in any part of the urinary system, leading to symptoms such as pain, frequent urination, and cloudy urine.

### 6. Deep Vein Thrombosis
- Formation of blood clots in deep veins, usually in the legs, which can cause swelling and pain.

### 7. Osteoporosis
- A condition where bones become weak and brittle, increasing the risk of fractures.

### 8. Viral Infection
- An illness caused by a virus, often presenting with symptoms like fever, cough, and fatigue.

### 9. Leukemia
- Cancer of the body's blood-forming tissues, including the bone marrow and the lymphatic system.

### 10. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
- A digestive disorder where stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, causing irritation.

### 11. Iron Deficiency Anemia
- A condition caused by a lack of iron, leading to insufficient healthy red blood cells and fatigue.

### 12. Kidney Stones
- Hard deposits formed in the kidneys causing severe pain, urination difficulties, and possibly infection.
