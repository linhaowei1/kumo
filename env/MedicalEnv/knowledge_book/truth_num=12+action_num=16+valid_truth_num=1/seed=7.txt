## Medical Analysis Guidebook

This guide provides an overview of common diseases and diagnostic tests used in their evaluation, focusing on interpreting test outcomes to rule out potential diagnoses.

### Diseases Overview

1. **Hepatitis B**
   - A viral infection that affects the liver and can lead to both acute and chronic disease.

2. **Hepatitis C**
   - A liver disease caused by the Hepatitis C virus, which can result in both chronic liver conditions and severe liver damage.

7. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) â€“ Ulcerative Colitis**
   - A chronic condition involving inflammation of the colon and rectum, leading to ulcer formation.

8. **Peptic Ulcer Disease**
   - A condition characterized by open sores developing on the inside lining of the stomach and upper small intestine.

9. **Sepsis**
   - A life-threatening response to infection that can result in organ dysfunction.

10. **Depression**
    - A mental health disorder marked by persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest.

11. **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)**
    - A group of lung disorders causing scarring of lung tissues, affecting breathing and oxygen intake.

12. **Pulmonary Fibrosis**
    - A lung disease that occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred, leading to breathing difficulties.

    - **Values (0, 5)**: Rule out Rheumatoid Arthritis.

15. **Chest CT Scan**
    - **Normal**: Rule out Pulmonary Fibrosis, Interstitial Lung Disease.

16. **Pulmonary Function Tests (Spirometry)**
    - **Normal**: Rule out Interstitial Lung Disease.
    - **Obstructive Pattern**: Rule out Interstitial Lung Disease.
