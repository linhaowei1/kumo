This guidebook introduces a set of diseases and corresponding diagnostic tests. These tests help in ruling out potential health conditions, enabling more accurate medical diagnoses. This guide will help healthcare professionals understand how different test outcomes can exclude certain diseases from being present.

## Diseases Overview

1. **Osteopenia**
   - A condition where bone mineral density is lower than normal but not low enough to be classified as osteoporosis.

2. **Bacterial Infection**
   - Infections caused by bacteria, which can present in various forms and affect different parts of the body.

3. **Sarcoidosis**
   - An inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas in different organs, primarily affecting the lungs.

4. **Heart Failure**
   - A chronic condition where the heart does not pump blood effectively to meet the body's needs.

5. **Vitamin D Deficiency**
   - Occurs when the levels of Vitamin D in the body are lower than necessary, affecting bone health and immune system function.

6. **Influenza**
   - A viral respiratory infection known as the flu, characterized by sudden fever, cough, and tiredness.

7. **Diabetes Mellitus Type 1**
   - A chronic condition where the pancreas produces little to no insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels.

8. **Asthma**
   - A respiratory condition marked by spasms in the bronchi of the lungs, causing difficulty in breathing.

9. **Chronic Bronchitis**
   - Involves inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often leading to persistent cough and mucus production.

10. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia**
    - A condition where there is a lack of sufficient Vitamin B12, causing a decrease in red blood cell production.

11. **Myocardial Infarction**
    - Commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked.

12. **Arrhythmia**
    - A condition characterized by an irregular heartbeat, which can be too fast or too slow.
