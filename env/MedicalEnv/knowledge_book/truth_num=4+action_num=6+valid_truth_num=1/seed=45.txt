# Medical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an introduction to specific diseases and their diagnostic tests, focusing on understanding when certain conditions can be ruled out based on test outcomes. Our focus diseases are: Peptic Ulcer Disease, Pulmonary Embolism, Anxiety Disorder, and Leukemia. The diagnostic tests covered include: Peripheral Blood Smear, Chest CT Scan, Depression Screening Questionnaire, Anxiety Screening Questionnaire, Complete Blood Count (CBC), and D-Dimer Test. Each section explains the disease and the corresponding tests used in their diagnosis or exclusion.

## Peptic Ulcer Disease

**Overview:**
Peptic Ulcer Disease involves the formation of sores in the lining of the stomach or the first part of the small intestine. Symptoms might include stomach pain, bloating, and in severe cases, bleeding.

**Note:** While specific diagnostic tests listed under this guidebook do not directly rule out Peptic Ulcer Disease, clinical assessments and other gastroenterological evaluations are commonly used.

## Pulmonary Embolism

**Overview:**
Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a serious condition where a blood clot blocks one or more arteries in the lungs. Symptoms often include sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing.

**Diagnostic Tests and Exclusion Guide:**

- **Chest CT Scan**: 
  - **Normal**: Rules out Pulmonary Embolism.
  - **Ground Glass Opacity**: Rules out Pulmonary Embolism.
  - **Mass**: Rules out Pulmonary Embolism.
  - **Fibrosis**: Rules out Pulmonary Embolism.
  - **Lymphadenopathy**: Rules out Pulmonary Embolism.

- **D-Dimer Test**: 
  - **Normal**: Rules out Pulmonary Embolism.
  
These tests are crucial in understanding when PE is not responsible for the symptoms the patient is experiencing.

## Anxiety Disorder

**Overview:**
Anxiety Disorder encompasses a range of conditions characterized by excessive worry, fear, or nervousness that can interfere with daily activities. Common symptoms include restlessness, rapid heartbeat, and difficulty concentrating.

**Diagnostic Tests and Exclusion Guide:**

- **Depression Screening Questionnaire**:
  - **Negative**: Rules out Anxiety Disorder.
  
- **Anxiety Screening Questionnaire**:
  - **Negative**: Rules out Anxiety Disorder.

Through careful psychological assessments, these questionnaires help determine whether anxiety is not the underlying issue.

## Leukemia

**Overview:**
Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, characterized by an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells. Patients may experience fatigue, frequent infections, and easy bruising or bleeding.

**Diagnostic Tests and Exclusion Guide:**

- **Peripheral Blood Smear**:
  - **Normal**: Rules out Leukemia.
  - **Microcytic Hypochromic**: Rules out Leukemia.
  - **Macrocytic**: Rules out Leukemia.
  - **Sickle Cells**: Rules out Leukemia.
  - **Blast Cells**: Does not rule out any specific conditions.
  
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:
  - **Normal**: Rules out Leukemia.

These hematological assessments help determine whether Leukemia is not present by distinguishing abnormalities typically associated with the disease.
