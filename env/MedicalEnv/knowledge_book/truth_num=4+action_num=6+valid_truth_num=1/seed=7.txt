# Medical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an overview of certain diseases and diagnostic tests. Each section outlines the relevance of specific tests in ruling out diseases rather than diagnosing them. This approach helps in narrowing down potential conditions through exclusion.

## Diseases

### Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can cause both acute and chronic liver disease. Transmission occurs through contact with infectious body fluids, such as blood, and through childbirth. Symptoms may include jaundice, abdominal pain, and fatigue, though some may be asymptomatic.

### Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Like hepatitis B, it can lead to chronic liver issues, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. It's primarily spread through blood-to-blood contact. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, including fever, fatigue, and jaundice.

### Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
SLE is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks its own tissues, resulting in widespread inflammation and tissue damage. It can affect joints, skin, brain, lungs, kidneys, and blood vessels. Symptoms are varied and may include fatigue, joint pain, skin rashes, and fever.

### Sepsis
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition resulting from the body's response to infection, leading to tissue damage, organ failure, and potentially death. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, fast heart rate, and an altered mental state.

## Diagnostic Tests

### Complete Blood Count (CBC)
A CBC tests a variety of blood components such as red and white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. It is often used to assess overall health and detect a variety of disorders.

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - A normal CBC result rules out Sepsis.
  - Anaemia, leukocytosis, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia outcomes are present but do not specifically rule out any mentioned diseases in this guidebook.

### Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) Test
An ANA test detects antinuclear antibodies in the blood. It is used to screen for autoimmune disorders, particularly SLE.

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - A positive ANA does not rule out any specific disease in this context.
  - A negative ANA result rules out SLE.

### Hepatitis C Antibody (Anti-HCV) Test
This test determines whether a person has been infected with the hepatitis C virus by detecting antibodies.

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - A positive result does not rule out any specific disease.
  - A negative result rules out Hepatitis C.

### C-Reactive Protein (CRP) Test
CRP is a substance produced by the liver in response to inflammation. The CRP test measures its levels in the blood.

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - CRP levels between 0 and 5 mg/L rule out SLE.
  - Levels from 6 to 200 mg/L do not rule out any diseases in this guidebook.

### Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) Test
The ESR test measures how quickly erythrocytes (red blood cells) settle at the bottom of a test tube. An elevated rate may indicate inflammation.

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - ESR levels between 0 and 20 mm/hr rule out SLE.
  - Levels from 21 to 100 mm/hr do not rule out any diseases discussed herein.

### Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) Test
The HBsAg test identifies the presence of the hepatitis B surface antigen, indicating a person is infected with the hepatitis B virus.

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - A positive result does not rule out any disease.
  - A negative result rules out Hepatitis B.

By using these tests, healthcare professionals can exclude certain conditions, which aids in narrowing down the possible diagnoses and tailoring further investigation and treatment accordingly.
