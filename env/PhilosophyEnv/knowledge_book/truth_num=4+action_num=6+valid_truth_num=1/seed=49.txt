# A Guidebook to Understanding and Assessing Key Philosophical Arguments

This guidebook is designed to introduce you to some significant philosophical arguments: Hume's Empiricism, Hegel's Absolute Idealism, Derrida's Deconstruction, and Hobbes' Leviathan. Additionally, it will provide assessment methods that will help you critically analyze these arguments and understand which arguments can be ruled out based on observed outcomes.

## Philosophical Arguments Overview

### 1. Hume's Empiricism
David Hume's empiricism emphasizes that all knowledge derives from sensory experience. He argues against the notion of innate ideas and stresses the role of observation and evidence in forming beliefs about the world.

### 2. Hegel's Absolute Idealism
G.W.F. Hegel's absolute idealism postulates that reality is fundamentally shaped by ideas rather than material conditions. He suggests that reality unfolds through a dialectical process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, eventually reaching the Absolute.

### 3. Derrida's Deconstruction
Jacques Derrida's deconstruction challenges the notion of fixed meanings in texts. It emphasizes the inherent instability and contradictions in language, arguing that meanings are always deferred, never fully present or complete.

### 4. Hobbes' Leviathan
Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan presents a social contract theory where individuals give up certain freedoms to a sovereign in exchange for order and security. He argues that in the absence of political authority, life would be 'nasty, brutish, and short.'

## Argument Assessment Methods and Outcomes

### Examining Logical Structure
This method involves analyzing the coherence and internal consistency of an argument. When applying this method:
- If the logical structure scores between 0 and 50, there are no specific arguments to rule out.
- If the logical structure scores between 50 and 100, **Hume's Empiricism** is ruled out.

### Examining Dialectical Methods
This approach evaluates the use of dialectical reasoning in an argument:
- If dialectical reasoning is used, **Hume's Empiricism** should be ruled out.
- If dialectical reasoning is absent, **Hegel's Absolute Idealism** is ruled out.

### Exploring Notions of Free Will
This assessment focuses on an argumentâ€™s stance on free will:
- If the argument affirms free will, **Hobbes' Leviathan** should be excluded.
- Denial of free will does not rule out any specific argument.

### Cross-referencing Historical Context
This involves considering how an argument aligns with historical philosophical contexts:
- If referencing Ancient Greek philosophy, **Hobbes' Leviathan**, **Derrida's Deconstruction**, **Hume's Empiricism**, and **Hegel's Absolute Idealism** can all be ruled out.
- The Enlightenment period offers no specific arguments to rule out.

### Analyzing Key Terminology
This method involves scrutinizing the use of specific terms within philosophical arguments:
- Frequent use of 'forms' and 'ideas' necessitates ruling out **Hume's Empiricism**.
- Use of 'empirical' and 'experience' does not indicate any arguments to rule out.

### Evaluating Epistemological Foundations
Assessment of the foundational beliefs about knowledge acquisition is key here:
- If knowledge is said to derive from reason, **Hume's Empiricism** should be ruled out.
- If knowledge derives from experience, no arguments are specifically excluded.

## Conclusion
Through a careful application of these assessment methods, you can systematically analyze philosophical arguments and determine which can be ruled out in various contexts. This guide aims to provide you with a comprehensive framework to engage with and critically assess philosophical discourse effectively.
