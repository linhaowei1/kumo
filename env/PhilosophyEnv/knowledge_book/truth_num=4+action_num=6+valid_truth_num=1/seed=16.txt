# Philosophical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to introduce some foundational philosophical arguments and provide methods to assess them. By understanding these arguments and employing the assessment techniques, readers can gain deeper insights into philosophical thought and the diverse ways these concepts interact with historical and contemporary contexts.

## Philosophical Arguments

1. **Wittgenstein's Language Games**

   Ludwig Wittgenstein's concept of language games argues that the meaning of words is shaped by their use in specific forms of life or social practices. Language, thus, is not a fixed system of representation but a series of games with varying rules, depending on circumstances or purposes.

2. **Augustine's Original Sin**

   Saint Augustine's doctrine of original sin posits that humanity inherits a sinful nature due to the transgressions of Adam and Eve. This idea profoundly affects concepts of human nature, morality, and the necessity of divine grace for salvation.

3. **Rawls' Theory of Justice**

   John Rawls presents a theory of justice as fairness, advocating for the structure of society to be determined under a “veil of ignorance.” This ensures that principles of justice are chosen objectively, without personal bias, and supports equal distribution of rights and responsibilities.

4. **Derrida's Deconstruction**

   Jacques Derrida's philosophy of deconstruction challenges the idea of fixed meaning in texts. It involves a critical analysis that reveals contradictions and reveals the complexities inherent in language, thus deconstructing established structures and concepts.

## Argument Assessment Methods

1. **Identifying Rhetorical Strategies**

   This method involves analyzing the rhetorical devices and methods used by philosophers in constructing their arguments. It highlights the persuasive techniques and structures, allowing us to uncover biases or strategic purposes behind the discourse.

   - **Exclusion Rule**: If rhetorical strategies score between 0 and 5, "Derrida's Deconstruction" is ruled out.

2. **Comparing with Contemporary Philosophies**

   This method examines how philosophical arguments align or contrast with current philosophical trends - whether they fit within analytic or continental traditions. This comparative analysis places each argument within a broader philosophical landscape.

   - **Exclusion Rule**: If aligned with continental philosophy, "Wittgenstein's Language Games" is ruled out.

3. **Exploring Notions of Free Will**

   In this assessment, we explore how philosophical arguments affirm or deny the existence of free will. This can reveal core assumptions about human agency and autonomy within philosophical discourse.

   - **Exclusion Rule**: If the argument denies free will, "Rawls' Theory of Justice" is ruled out.

4. **Cross-referencing Historical Context**

   By cross-referencing with historical contexts, we assess how philosophical arguments are influenced by or respond to historical ideas or movements, such as Ancient Greek philosophy or the Enlightenment.

   - **Exclusion Rule**: If linked to Ancient Greek philosophy, "Augustine's Original Sin", "Derrida's Deconstruction", "Rawls' Theory of Justice", and "Wittgenstein's Language Games" are ruled out.

5. **Examining Authorial Intent**

   This method investigates the philosopher's intentions in formulating their argument, seeking to understand the motivations and overarching goals within their philosophical project.

   - **Exclusion Rule**: If authorial intent scores between 50 and 100, "Derrida's Deconstruction" and "Wittgenstein's Language Games" are ruled out.

6. **Analyzing Key Terminology**

   By dissecting the specific terminology employed in arguments, we can identify particular influences or focus areas, which can expose deeper philosophical commitments and misunderstandings.

   - **Exclusion Rule**: Not applicable as no arguments are tied to the given terminological outcomes.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides insight into both key philosophical arguments and robust methods for analyzing them. By applying these assessment techniques, we can critically evaluate and place these philosophical discourses within broader intellectual traditions and contexts. This structured approach aims to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of philosophical inquiry.
