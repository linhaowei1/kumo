# Philosophical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook provides a framework for analyzing philosophical arguments using various assessment methods. The philosophical arguments explored include Anscombe's Virtue Ethics, Nietzsche's Will to Power, Epicurus' Hedonism, and Frege's Sense and Reference. The assessment methods allow for a structured examination, focusing on historical context, metaphysical assumptions, authorial intent, ethical implications, comparisons with contemporary philosophies, and rhetorical strategies. This guide is designed to highlight arguments that must be ruled out based on specific observations, making it easier to focus on relevant philosophical insights.

## Philosophical Arguments

1. **Anscombe's Virtue Ethics**: 
   - Focuses on the importance of moral character and virtues rather than rules or consequences. 
   - Central to examining how ethical behavior is derived from an individual's virtues and practical reasoning.

2. **Nietzsche's Will to Power**: 
   - Centered on the concept that fundamental driving force in humans is the will to powerâ€”an inherent drive to dominate and actualize one's ambitions.
   - Often involves interpreting metaphysical and existential assumptions about human motivation.

3. **Epicurus' Hedonism**: 
   - Hedonism posits that the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain are the primary or most important intrinsic goods and objectives of human life.
   - Emphasizes measured, contemplative pleasures over indulgent ones to achieve a tranquil life.

4. **Frege's Sense and Reference**: 
   - An analytic philosophy concerning how language and symbols relate to the objects they signify. 
   - Differentiates between 'sense' (the way of presenting a reference) and 'reference' (the actual object being referred to).

## Argument Assessment Methods

1. **Cross-referencing Historical Context**: 
   - Examines the philosophical arguments within their historical backdrop, providing insight into the influences and ideas shaping them.
   - *Rule-out Rules*: 
     - If within Ancient Greek philosophy, rule out Anscombe's Virtue Ethics, Nietzsche's Will to Power, and Frege's Sense and Reference.
     - If within the Enlightenment period, rule out Epicurus' Hedonism.

2. **Interpreting Metaphysical Assumptions**:
   - Explores the underlying assumptions about reality embedded within philosophical arguments, distinguishing between dualistic and monistic perspectives.
   - *Rule-out Rules*:
     - If assuming a dualistic reality, rule out Nietzsche's Will to Power.
     - If asserting a monistic reality, no arguments are ruled out as the set is empty.

3. **Examining Authorial Intent**:
   - Investigates the purpose and motivation behind the author's philosophical stance.
   - *Rule-out Rules*:
     - If the author's intent score is between 50 and 100, rule out Nietzsche's Will to Power.

4. **Assessing Ethical Implications**:
   - Evaluates the ethical dimensions and consequences emphasized by the philosophical arguments.
   - *Rule-out Rules*:
     - If emphasizing duty-based ethics or focusing on consequences, rule out Anscombe's Virtue Ethics.
     - No arguments are ruled out for highlighting virtue ethics as the set is empty.

5. **Comparing with Contemporary Philosophies**:
   - Aligns the argument in question with modern-day philosophical schools of thought to assess its continuing relevance and insights.
   - *Rule-out Rules*:
     - If aligning with continental philosophy, rule out Frege's Sense and Reference.
     - No arguments are ruled out for aligning with analytic philosophy as the set is empty.

6. **Identifying Rhetorical Strategies**:
   - Analyzes the techniques and styles used by philosophers to craft and convey their arguments effectively.
   - *Rule-out Rules*:
     - If the rhetorical strategy index is between 0 and 5, rule out Nietzsche's Will to Power.
     - If the rhetorical strategy index is between 5 and 10, no arguments are ruled out as the set is empty.

## Conclusion

This guidebook offers a structured approach to analyzing philosophical arguments through various assessment lenses. By understanding and applying these methods, one can effectively engage with the complexities of philosophical discourse, focusing on arguments relevant to respective assessment outcomes. Remember that the key to this analysis lies in ruling out certain philosophical arguments based on the observed implications within each assessment criterion.
