# Mythic Religion Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook aims to introduce four mythological religions—Aztec Mythology, Basque Mythology, Inuit Mythology, and Japanese Mythology—and provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing these religions through six distinct analytical techniques. Each technique includes specific outcomes that help exclude certain religions when those outcomes are observed, thereby narrowing down the field of study.

## Mythological Religions

### Aztec Mythology
Aztec mythology, rooted in the rich cultural tapestry of Central America, is characterized by a complex pantheon of gods, ritualistic practices, and a strong connection to the natural world. It is known for its intricate cosmology and the significance of astronomical events.

### Basque Mythology
Basque mythology stems from the Basque region of Spain and France, and it features a distinctive pantheon of deities that often embody natural elements. It is noted for having unique female deities and a rich oral tradition passed down through generations.

### Inuit Mythology
Inuit mythology, from the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, is centered around the land, sea, and sky. It heavily incorporates shamanistic practices and is deeply entwined with the harsh natural environment, focusing on survival and respect for nature.

### Japanese Mythology
Japanese mythology intertwines Shinto beliefs with Buddhist influences, presenting a pantheon of kami (spirits) that govern various aspects of life and the natural world. It emphasizes harmony with nature and features diverse deities, including powerful warrior gods.

## Analysis Techniques

### Shamanic Practice Analysis
This technique focuses on the presence or absence of shamanistic practices within a mythology. When "Shamanism Central" is observed, Inuit Mythology is ruled out as it is heavily shamanistic. No mythologies are ruled out if shamanism is absent, as no set has been indicated.

### Sacred Geometry Analysis
Sacred Geometry Analysis examines the use of geometrical patterns or symbols. The presence of mandalas, as found in Aztec Mythology, rules out this religion from consideration. An absence of geometric patterns, as noted in Inuit Mythology, will also rule it out.

### Sky Deity Examination
This analysis looks at the gender and characteristics of sky deities. For mythologies with female sky deities, Basque Mythology is excluded due to its unique inclusion of such deities. No mythologies are ruled out based on the presence of male sky deities as specified.

### Sacrificial Rites Comparison
This technique compares the sacrificial practices across different mythologies. Blood sacrifice practices are a key component of Japanese and Basque Mythology; observing this will rule them out. In contrast, offerings of food and drink, observed in Aztec Mythology, lead to its exclusion.

### Warrior Deity Comparison
Warrior Deity Comparison focuses on the prominence of warrior deities. When a central warrior deity is identified, as seen in Japanese Mythology, this religion can be excluded. Conversely, Aztec Mythology is ruled out when warrior deities are less emphasized.

### Pantheon Structure Analysis
This analysis evaluates the structure and size of the pantheon relevant to each mythology. A pantheon size ranging from 0 to 5 excludes Japanese Mythology. A pantheon ranging from 6 to 50 leads to the exclusion of Basque and Inuit Mythologies. No mythologies are ruled out for larger pantheons of 51 to 100 deities, as no set has been indicated.
