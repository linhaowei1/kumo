# Mythic Religion Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook serves as an introductory tool for analyzing various mythological religions, focusing on four distinct traditions: Hurrian Mythology, Sumerian Mythology, Mayan Mythology, and Native American Mythologies. By employing a systematic approach using six unique analysis techniques, scholars and enthusiasts can gain insights into these rich and diverse mythological traditions.

## Mythological Religions

### 1. Hurrian Mythology
The mystical traditions of the ancient Hurrians, who inhabited regions of what is now modern-day Turkey and Syria, are known for their rich pantheon infused with Indo-European influences.

### 2. Sumerian Mythology
As one of the earliest known mythologies from ancient Mesopotamia, Sumerian mythology includes tales of gods and goddesses in celestial, earth, and underworld settings, influencing later mythologies significantly.

### 3. Mayan Mythology
Mayan mythology, encompassing the tales and beliefs of the ancient Maya civilization, is renowned for its complex cosmology, time cycles, and the integration of deities within their calendars and writing systems.

### 4. Native American Mythologies
This diverse and varied set of mythologies represents numerous indigenous peoples across the Americas, each with its own unique traditions, narratives, and spiritual concepts.

## Analysis Techniques

### 1. Textual Parallel Studies
This technique involves comparing the textual structures and themes of different mythologies to identify similarities to other cultural texts.

- **Similarity to Semitic Texts**: When evidence of this is noted, Mayan Mythology is excluded from being a primary parallel.
- **Similarity to Indo-European Texts**: Finding this similarity leads to ruling out both Hurrian Mythology and Sumerian Mythology.
- **Unique Textual Structures**: No mythologies are specifically excluded based on unique structural findings, allowing the identification of singular elements without exclusion.

### 2. Sacred Geometry Analysis
This method examines the use of geometric patterns in mythological symbolism and sacred spaces.

- **Use of Mandalas**: Should mandalas appear prominently, Mayan Mythology is not considered part of this geometric examination.
- **Absence of Geometric Patterns**: Observing no significant geometric patterns precludes Native American Mythologies from further analysis in this context.

### 3. Flood Myth Analysis
This analysis explores the narrative and symbolic significance of flood myths across mythologies, categorizing them based on perceived scale.

- **Flood Myths (0.0 - 0.3)**: For these lower significance levels, no specific mythologies are ruled out.
- **Flood Myths (0.7 - 1.0)**: Finding high significance in flood narratives excludes Native American Mythologies, Mayan Mythology, and Sumerian Mythology from particular consideration.

### 4. Divine Kingship Analysis
This technique scrutinizes the relationship between divine figures and earthly rulers in mythological traditions.

- **Kings as Deities or Demigods**: Absence of this theme leads to eliminating no mythologies as itâ€™s a universal attribute in many traditions.
- **Separation of Kingship and Deity**: Discovering this separation pattern results in Mayan Mythology being ruled out from the analysis concerning divine kingship.

### 5. Ancestor Worship Comparison
This involves comparing the roles and veneration of ancestors in different mythological religions.

- **Strong Ancestor Worship Practices**: Demonstrating these practices excludes Mayan Mythology, signifying its divergent focus within ancestral themes.
- **Minimal Ancestor Worship Practices**: Finding minimal involvement rules out no traditions due to the universal respect for ancestors.

### 6. Lunar Deity Examination
An analysis focused on the role and gender characterization of lunar deities.

- **Moon as Male Deity**: Identifying this pattern necessitates excluding Mayan Mythology, marking its unique portrayal of lunar figures.
- **Moon as Female Deity**: Discoveries of this gender alignment do not rule out any of the mythological religions under current analysis conditions.

## Conclusion
By applying these analysis techniques, this guidebook aids in ruling out certain mythological traditions when specific characteristics or themes are identified. Thus, scholars can narrow down cultural influences or origins when studying mythological texts and symbols. Through systematic exclusion, deeper understanding and contextual exploration of each individual mythology are achieved.
