# Rocket Fuel Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an overview of certain rocket fuels and a set of experiments designed to analyze them. The primary objective of these tests is to understand the compatibility, safety, and characteristics of various fuels by ruling out certain possibilities through observed outcomes. Each fuel and experiment is described in natural language to facilitate clear understanding.

## Rocket Fuels

1. **Liquid Ethanol**
   - Liquid ethanol is an alcohol-based fuel with potential use in rocket propulsion. It is characterized by its flammable nature and ability to blend with other compounds for enhanced performance.

2. **Solid Ammonium Perchlorate-Based Propellant**
   - This solid propellant is commonly used in rockets due to its stability and high-energy output. It consists of ammonium perchlorate as the oxidizer and a binding agent, creating a composite propellant.

3. **Pentaborane (B5H9)**
   - Pentaborane is a boron-based liquid fuel known for its high energy density. Historically considered for advanced propulsion systems, it possesses unique properties, albeit with potential toxicity concerns.

4. **Liquid Hydrogen (LH2)**
   - Liquid hydrogen is a cryogenic fuel known for its high performance and clean burning, producing mainly water vapor upon combustion. It requires special handling due to its extremely low temperatures.

## Experiments and Observed Outcomes

### 1. Density Measurement of Fuel

**Objective**: Measure the density of different rocket fuels to gather insight into their physical properties.

- **Outcome Range (800, 1000 kg/m³)**:
  - Rule Out: Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) and Liquid Ethanol
  - Explanation: If a fuel's density falls within this range, it cannot be Liquid Hydrogen or Liquid Ethanol, as these fuels do not fit this density profile.

- **Outcome Range (70, 80 kg/m³)**:
  - No fuels to rule out from this range since no available fuels fit this profile.

### 2. Emission of Toxic Gases Measurement

**Objective**: Assess the emission of toxic gases during fuel combustion to ensure safety and environmental compliance.

- **High Toxicity Detected**:
  - Rule Out: Liquid Hydrogen (LH2)
  - Explanation: If high toxicity is detected, Liquid Hydrogen is ruled out due to its primarily clean combustion yielding water vapor.

- **Low Toxicity Detected**:
  - Rule Out: Pentaborane (B5H9)
  - Explanation: Liquid Hydrogen typically exhibits clean emissions; thus, Pentaborane's potential toxicity eliminates it if low toxicity is observed.

### 3. Fuel Odor Analysis

**Objective**: Analyze the odor of fuel when stored or burned to aid in identification and safety assessments.

- **Pungent Odor**:
  - Rule Out: Liquid Hydrogen (LH2)
  - Explanation: If a fuel emits a strong odor, it cannot be Liquid Hydrogen, which is generally odorless.

- **Odorless**:
  - No fuels to rule out based on this state.

### 4. Exhaust Plume Spectroscopy

**Objective**: Examine the exhaust plume to detect specific compounds and elements released during combustion.

- **High Water Vapor Detected**:
  - Rule Out: Pentaborane (B5H9)
  - Explanation: Liquid Hydrogen's combustion results in high water vapor output, thus excluding Pentaborane when such detection occurs.

- **High CO2 Content Detected**:
  - Rule Out: Liquid Hydrogen (LH2)
  - Explanation: If high CO2 is detected in the exhaust, it cannot be from Liquid Hydrogen, known for low CO2 emissions.

- **Metallic Particles Detected**:
  - Rule Out: Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) and Liquid Ethanol
  - Explanation: Presence of metallic particles in the plume rules out fuels typically free from such emissions.

### 5. Soot Particle Detection

**Objective**: Identify the presence and quantity of soot particles in the exhaust.

- **High Soot Levels**:
  - Rule Out: Liquid Hydrogen (LH2)
  - Explanation: Liquid Hydrogen's exhaust is generally free of soot; thus, its presence indicates another fuel.

- **No Soot Detected**:
  - No fuels to rule out based on this state.

### 6. Flame Color Observation

**Objective**: Observe flame color during fuel combustion to identify fuel type based on its combustion characteristics.

- **Bright Blue Flame**:
  - Rule Out: Pentaborane (B5H9) and Solid Ammonium Perchlorate-Based Propellant
  - Explanation: If a bright blue flame is observed, it eliminates these fuels due to their specific flame signatures.

- **Green Flame**:
  - Rule Out: Liquid Hydrogen (LH2)
  - Explanation: A green flame appearance suggests elements present in other fuels, ruling out Liquid Hydrogen.

- **Orange Flame**:
  - Rule Out: Liquid Hydrogen (LH2)
  - Explanation: Often associated with incomplete combustion or different chemical content than Liquid Hydrogen.

This guide exists to help systematically identify rocket fuels based on physical and chemical tests, effectively ruling out possibilities to narrow down to the correct fuel type. Each experiment provides crucial information that can eliminate certain fuels, aiding in precise analysis and decision-making in rocket propulsion research and applications.
