# Rocket Fuel Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to help you understand the characteristics of various rocket fuels through a series of experiments. We look at four different rocket fuels: Liquid Ethanol, Liquid Carbon Monoxide, RP-1 (Refined Kerosene), and Solid Composite Propellant. By conducting specific experiments, we can analyze the properties and reactions of these fuels to identify or rule them out based on observed results.

## Rocket Fuels Overview

1. **Liquid Ethanol**: A type of alcohol used as a rocket fuel for its clean-burning properties.
2. **Liquid Carbon Monoxide**: A lesser-known rocket fuel that, under certain conditions, can produce substantial thrust.
3. **RP-1 (Refined Kerosene)**: A highly refined type of kerosene utilized in many liquid rocket engines due to its energy density and stable combustion.
4. **Solid Composite Propellant**: A type of solid fuel combining an oxidizer with a rubbery binder, offering reliable and consistent thrust.

## Experiments and Analysis

The following experiments are designed to distinguish these rocket fuels based on their combustion characteristics and the resulting evidence.

### 1. Flame Color Observation

This experiment involves analyzing the color of the flame produced by the burning fuel.

- **Bright Blue Flame**: If observed, this rules out the use of Solid Composite Propellant.
- **Green Flame**: Currently, no rocket fuels are specifically ruled out by this observation.
- **Orange Flame**: No specific rocket fuels are ruled out based on this observation.

### 2. Soot Particle Detection

In this experiment, we measure the soot particles emitted during fuel combustion.

- **High Soot Levels**: No specific rocket fuels are ruled out by detecting high levels of soot.
- **No Soot Detected**: If no soot is detected, RP-1 (Refined Kerosene) is ruled out.

### 3. Density Measurement of Fuel

This experiment measures the density of the rocket fuels before combustion.

- **Density (800 to 1000 kg/m³)**: Observing a density within this range rules out Liquid Ethanol.
- **Density (70 to 80 kg/m³)**: If the density falls in this range, both RP-1 (Refined Kerosene) and Solid Composite Propellant are ruled out.

### 4. Combustion Temperature Measurement

The combustion temperature of the fuel is measured in this experiment.

- **Temperature (3000 to 3500 K)**: Observing this temperature range does not rule out any specific rocket fuel.
- **Temperature (2000 to 2500 K)**: If the combustion temperature is within this range, Solid Composite Propellant is ruled out.

### 5. Exhaust Plume Spectroscopy

This involves analyzing the composition of the exhaust plume produced during combustion.

- **High Water Vapor Detected**: Detecting high levels of water vapor rules out Liquid Carbon Monoxide.
- **High CO2 Content Detected**: No rocket fuels are specifically ruled out by detecting high CO2 content.
- **Metallic Particles Detected**: If metallic particles are detected, Liquid Ethanol is ruled out.

### 6. Emission of Toxic Gases Measurement

We assess the levels of toxic gases emitted during fuel combustion in this experiment.

- **High Toxicity**: If high toxicity is recorded, RP-1 (Refined Kerosene) is ruled out.
- **Low Toxicity**: Observing low toxicity does not rule out any specific rocket fuel.

By conducting these experiments, we can systematically narrow down which fuels might be in use based on the characteristics observed. Each observed outcome allows us to exclude certain fuels, aiding in precise identification and analysis.
