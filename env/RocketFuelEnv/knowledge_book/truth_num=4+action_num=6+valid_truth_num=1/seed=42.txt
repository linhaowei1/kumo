# Rocket Fuel Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to assist you in analyzing different rocket fuels using a series of experiments. We will explore four types of rocket fuels and conduct various tests to eliminate possibilities based on observed outcomes.

## Rocket Fuels

1. **Hydrazine**: A highly reactive and volatile fuel commonly used in aerospace applications. It is known for its powerful combustion characteristics.

2. **Liquid Ethanol**: A type of alcohol fuel that is more environmentally friendly compared to more traditional rocket fuels. It is known for its clean-burning properties.

3. **Solid Ammonium Nitrate-Based Propellant**: A solid rocket fuel composed mainly of ammonium nitrate. It is prized for its stability and ease of use.

4. **Liquid Carbon Monoxide**: An uncommon rocket fuel that produces a unique combustion profile. It is typically used in specific chemical reactions and processes.

## Experiments and Their Outcomes

### 1. Exhaust Plume Spectroscopy

This experiment analyzes the exhaust plume of the rocket fuel, identifying the chemical composition through light spectroscopy.

- **High water vapor detected**: When this outcome is observed, **Liquid Carbon Monoxide** is ruled out.
  
- **High CO2 content detected**: If high CO2 content is observed in the spectroscopy, **Hydrazine** is ruled out.

- **Metallic particles detected**: The presence of metallic particles in the exhaust rules out **Liquid Ethanol** and **Hydrazine**.

### 2. Fuel Odor Analysis

This straightforward test involves analyzing the fuel's odor.

- **Pungent odor**: This outcome eliminates no specific fuels from consideration.

- **Odorless**: If the fuel is odorless, you can rule out **Hydrazine**.

### 3. Density Measurement of Fuel

Measuring the density of the rocket fuel can help identify or rule out certain types.

- **Density between 800 and 1000 kg/m³**: If the fuel's density falls within this range, **Liquid Ethanol** is ruled out.
  
- **Density between 70 and 80 kg/m³**: A measurement within this range rules out **Hydrazine**.

### 4. Combustion Temperature Measurement

This experiment measures the temperature generated during the combustion of fuel.

- **Temperature between 3000 and 3500 K**: If observed, this temperature range rules out **Hydrazine**.
  
- **Temperature between 2000 and 2500 K**: This outcome does not exclude any specific fuels.

### 5. Soot Particle Detection

Detecting the levels of soot generated during combustion assists in eliminating certain fuels.

- **High soot levels**: This result rules out **Hydrazine**.

- **No soot detected**: No specific fuels are ruled out when soot levels are low or absent.

### 6. Fuel Freezing Point Measurement

The freezing point of a fuel can be indicative of its chemical properties.

- **Freezing point between 50 and 100 K**: Observing this freezing point allows us to rule out **Hydrazine**.
  
- **Freezing point between 250 and 300 K**: No fuels are ruled out with this freezing point range.

## Conclusion

Each experiment serves to eliminate specific rocket fuels based on the outcomes observed. By understanding and applying these results, determining the right fuel for a given situation becomes more manageable. Keep this guide on hand to facilitate efficient fuel analysis in your rocket propulsion projects.
