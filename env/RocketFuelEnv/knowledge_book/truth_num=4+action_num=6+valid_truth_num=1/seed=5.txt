# Rocket Fuel Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an overview of four rocket fuels commonly analyzed in propulsion experiments. Through a series of experiments, we can deduce characteristics of these fuels based on the outcomes observed. This guide focuses on ruling out certain rocket fuels based on specific experimental observations. 

## Rocket Fuels

1. **Solid Ammonium Perchlorate-Based Propellant**: This solid propellant is commonly used in rocket boosters due to its stable performance and high thrust capabilities.

2. **Solid Lithium-based Fuel**: Known for its high energy density, lithium-based fuels are explored for their potential in achieving efficient propulsion systems.

3. **Liquid Carbon Monoxide (CO)**: This liquid fuel can be used in certain propulsion technologies and is notable for its unique properties and behavior during combustion.

4. **Liquid Ethane**: A hydrocarbon fuel used in liquid rockets, noted for its potential efficiency and energy release during combustion.

## Experiments and Rule-Out Outcomes

The following experiments help determine the characteristics of rocket fuels. If a specific outcome is observed during an experiment, certain fuels can be excluded as candidates based on the results.

### 1. Exhaust Plume Spectroscopy

This experiment involves analyzing the exhaust gases of a fuel during combustion to determine its composition.

- **High water vapor detected**: If this outcome is observed, the fuels Solid Lithium-based Fuel and Liquid Carbon Monoxide can be ruled out.
  
- **Metallic particles detected**: Liquid Ethane should be excluded as a candidate fuel if metallic particles are present in the exhaust.

### 2. Soot Particle Detection

Soot particle detection measures the levels of unburned carbon particles produced during combustion.

- **No soot detected**: With this result, Liquid Ethane can be excluded as a potential choice, indicating it does not produce soot particles.

### 3. Flame Color Observation

The color of the flame during combustion provides insights into the combusted materials.

- **Bright blue flame**: If a bright blue flame is observed, Solid Ammonium Perchlorate-Based Propellant must be ruled out as the fuel source.

### 4. Density Measurement of Fuel

This test measures the density of the liquid fuels to determine their characteristics.

- **Density range of 800 to 1000**: If the fuel's density falls within this range, Liquid Ethane should be ruled out.

### 5. Combustion Temperature Measurement

The temperature at which the fuel combusts can help identify or eliminate certain fuel types.

- If the temperature falls within any defined range, no specific ruling out of fuels is applicable from the given data.

### 6. Fuel Odor Analysis

Detecting the odor of the fuel can provide additional clues to its identity.

- No specific outcomes for odor have been provided to exclude any of the specified fuels.

## Conclusion

Understanding which fuels to exclude based on the experimental outcomes is crucial for identifying and verifying rocket fuel characteristics. This guidebook provides the necessary framework for ruling out specific rocket fuels, enhancing the accuracy of experimental deductions in propulsion analysis.
