# Rocket Fuel Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of selected rocket fuels and the experiments designed to analyze them. Understanding these fuels requires a meticulous approach through various experimental assessments. The guide outlines each type of rocket fuel, describes the respective experiments, and explains how the results can determine which fuels are unlikely candidates for certain outcomes.

## Rocket Fuels Overview

1. **Pentaborane (B5H9)**: A boron hydride, known for its high energy density and bright blue flame when combusted.

2. **Nitrous Oxide (N2O)**: A commonly used oxidizer in hybrid rocket engines, noted for its role in producing a high carbon dioxide content when burned.

3. **Liquid Oxygen (LOX)**: A widely utilized oxidizer in conjunction with rocket propellants; has a unique pungent odor and a defined freezing point within the 250-300 K range.

4. **Liquid Butane**: An alternative hydrocarbon fuel that may exhibit metallic particles in its exhaust under specific burning conditions.

## Experiments and Their Outcomes

### 1. Exhaust Plume Spectroscopy

This experiment analyzes the composition of the exhaust plume produced by a burning rocket fuel.

- **High water vapor detected**: If observed, rule out **Pentaborane (B5H9)**.
- **High CO2 content detected**: If observed, rule out **Nitrous Oxide (N2O)**.
- **Metallic particles detected**: If observed, rule out **Liquid Butane**.

### 2. Flame Color Observation

In this test, the flame color produced by the burning fuel is observed.

- **Bright blue flame**: If observed, rule out **Pentaborane (B5H9)**.
- **Green flame**: While stated as a potential observation, no specific fuels are ruled out based on this observation.
- **Orange flame**: Similarly, this observation does not lead to the exclusion of any particular fuel.

### 3. Fuel Odor Analysis

This experiment assesses the odor of the fuel.

- **Pungent odor**: If detected, rule out **Liquid Oxygen (LOX)**.
- **Odorless**: Although listed as a potential outcome, it does not provide grounds to exclude any of the fuels listed.

### 4. Fuel Freezing Point Measurement

Involves measuring the temperature range at which the fuel transitions to a solid state.

- **Freezing Point between 250 and 300 K**: If measured, rule out **Liquid Oxygen (LOX)**.
- **Freezing Point between 50 and 100 K**: This range presents no basis for excluding any fuel.

### 5. Emission of Toxic Gases Measurement

This test determines the level of toxicity in the gases emitted during fuel combustion.

- **High toxicity**: No specific fuels can be excluded based on this outcome.
- **Low toxicity**: If observed, rule out **Pentaborane (B5H9)**.

### 6. Density Measurement of Fuel

This experiment measures the density of the fuel to assess compatibility and performance.

- **Density between 800 and 1000 kg/m³**: If measured, no exclusion of fuels occurs.
- **Density between 70 and 80 kg/m³**: Again, this range does not lead to the exclusion of any particular fuel.

## Summary

This guidebook presents a detailed overview of how different experimental outcomes influence the exclusion of certain rocket fuels from consideration. Each experiment is a critical tool to narrow down possibilities and ensure the selection of the appropriate fuel for the specific rocket application. Understanding and applying these rule-out criteria is essential for efficient and accurate fuel analysis.
