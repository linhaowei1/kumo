# Rocket Fuel Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook serves as an introduction to analyzing various rocket fuels through a series of experimental tests. Our primary focus here is on four types of rocket fuels and an array of experiments that provide insights into the nature and behavior of these fuels. Through this guide, we will systematically explore fuels and link them to observable outcomes of specific tests, leading to exclusions of certain fuels when certain results are detected. This approach enhances clarity in selecting suitable rocket fuels for different applications.

## Rocket Fuels

### 1. Nitrous Oxide (N2O)
Nitrous Oxide is a well-known oxidizer often used in hybrid rocket engines. It provides an environment for combustion to take place, combining with other fuels to release energy.

### 2. Liquid Hydrogen (LH2)
Liquid Hydrogen is a cryogenic fuel used primarily in combination with oxidizers such as liquid oxygen. It is known for its high specific impulse and is used in space launch vehicles.

### 3. Solid Ammonium Nitrate-Based Propellant
This type of solid propellant is used for its stable storage and performance in smaller rocket systems. It typically combines ammonium nitrate as an oxidizer with a binder fuel.

### 4. Metalized Fuels (e.g., Aluminum-based)
These fuels incorporate metals like aluminum to enhance energy content and combustion temperatures. They are often used in solid rocket motors due to their high energy density.

## Experiments and Outcomes

Each experiment offers insights that are crucial in ruling out specific fuels based on observable outcomes. Here, we detail each experiment alongside the exclusion criteria derived from the test results.

### Exhaust Plume Spectroscopy

Exhaust plume spectroscopy examines the gases and particles emitted in the exhaust plume during combustion.

- **High water vapor detected**: Excludes Metalized Fuels (e.g., Aluminum-based).
- **High CO2 content detected**: Excludes Nitrous Oxide (N2O) and Liquid Hydrogen (LH2).
- **Metallic particles detected**: Excludes Liquid Hydrogen (LH2).

### Soot Particle Detection

This experiment detects soot particles, indicating incomplete combustion and efficiency of fuel use.

- **High soot levels**: Excludes Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) and Metalized Fuels (e.g., Aluminum-based).
- **No soot detected**: No specific exclusions.

### Density Measurement of Fuel

Density measurement seeks to determine the fuel's mass relation to its volume, crucial for fuel performance and storage.

- **Density between 800 and 1000**: Excludes Liquid Hydrogen (LH2).
- **Density between 70 and 80**: No specific exclusions.

### Fuel Odor Analysis

Fuel odor analysis helps in identifying distinct volatile compounds present in the fuel.

- **Pungent odor**: Excludes Liquid Hydrogen (LH2).
- **Odorless**: No specific exclusions.

### Fuel Freezing Point Measurement

Assessing the freezing point indicates how fuels behave under low temperature conditions, critical for cryogenic fuels.

- **Freezing point between 50 and 100**: No specific exclusions.
- **Freezing point between 250 and 300**: Excludes Liquid Hydrogen (LH2).

### Combustion Temperature Measurement

Measuring combustion temperature is vital for assessing the energy output and efficiency of the fuel.

- **Temperature between 3000 and 3500**: No specific exclusions.
- **Temperature between 2000 and 2500**: Excludes Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) and Metalized Fuels (e.g., Aluminum-based).

This guide highlights the analytical process used to evaluate and exclude certain rocket fuels based on experimental outcomes. By conducting these experiments, we gain a clearer understanding of which fuels are unsuitable for specific results, aiding in better decision-making for rocket fuel selection and application.
