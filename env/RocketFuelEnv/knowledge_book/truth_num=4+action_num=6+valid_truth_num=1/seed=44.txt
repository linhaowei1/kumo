# Rocket Fuel Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
Rocket fuels are critical components in the propulsion systems of space vehicles. Understanding their characteristics and behaviors is essential for the safe, efficient, and effective operation of these systems. This guidebook introduces four types of rocket fuels and outlines a series of experiments designed to analyze their properties.

### Rocket Fuels:
1. **Liquid Propane (LPG):** A commonly used fuel due to its availability and energy content. It is known for being a gaseous hydrocarbon fuel stored under pressure as a liquid.
   
2. **Liquid Ammonia (NH3):** A nitrogen-hydrogen compound that offers the advantage of being a potential hydrogen store with a relatively high energy density compared to its weight.
   
3. **Solid Composite Propellant:** A mixture of fuel and oxidizer in a solid form, widely used because of its simplicity and stability during storage.

4. **Pentaborane (B5H9):** A boron hydride notable for its high energy density and the production of boron oxide upon combustion, which can affect its practical use due to toxicity concerns.

## Experiments and Observations

### 1. Combustion Temperature Measurement
This experiment determines the temperature range during the fuel's combustion. The observations can rule out certain fuels based on their characteristic combustion temperatures.

- **Temperature: 3000 - 3500 K:** Excludes Liquid Ammonia (NH3) as a possibility for fuels exhibiting this temperature range.
- **Temperature: 2000 - 2500 K:** Excludes Solid Composite Propellant from fuels showing this temperature range.

### 2. Emission of Toxic Gases Measurement
This test measures the toxicity of gases emitted during fuel combustion, which is crucial for environmental and health considerations.

- **High Toxicity:** Rules out Liquid Propane (LPG) as a fuel choice if high toxicity levels are detected.
- **Low Toxicity:** Excludes both Pentaborane (B5H9) and Liquid Ammonia (NH3) from fuels demonstrating low toxicity levels.

### 3. Fuel Odor Analysis
This analysis determines the odor of the fuel, which can be a factor in identifying storage and handling requirements.
 
- **Pungent Odor:** Liquid Propane (LPG) will be ruled out if a pungent odor is detected.
- **Odorless:** Excludes Liquid Ammonia (NH3) if the fuel is found to be odorless.

### 4. Density Measurement of Fuel
Determining the density of the fuel is key to understanding its storage and transport characteristics.

- **Density: 800 to 1000 kg/m³:** Rules out Liquid Ammonia (NH3) as a possible fuel at this density.
- **Density: 70 to 80 kg/m³:** Excludes Solid Composite Propellant and Liquid Propane (LPG) when the fuel lies within this density range.

### 5. Exhaust Plume Spectroscopy
This experiment examines the composition of the exhaust plume, providing insights into the combustion process and by-products.

- **High Water Vapor Detected:** Excludes Pentaborane (B5H9) if high water vapor is observed.
- **High CO2 Content Detected:** Rules out Liquid Ammonia (NH3) as a possibility.
- **Metallic Particles Detected:** Excludes both Liquid Ammonia (NH3) and Liquid Propane (LPG) if metallic particles are found.

### 6. Soot Particle Detection
The presence of soot particles in the exhaust is a concern for engine wear and environmental impact.

- **High Soot Levels:** Liquid Ammonia (NH3) is ruled out if there are high soot levels.
- **No Soot Detected:** Excludes Liquid Propane (LPG) if no soot is present.

## Conclusion
This guidebook provides a structured approach to analyzing potential rocket fuels through various experiments and observations. By understanding which fuels are ruled out under specific conditions, engineers and scientists can make informed decisions to ensure optimal performance and safety in rocket propulsion systems.
