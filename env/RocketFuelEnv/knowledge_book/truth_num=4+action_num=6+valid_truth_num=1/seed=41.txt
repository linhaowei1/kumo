# Rocket Fuel Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Rocket Fuel Analysis Guidebook, where we introduce various rocket fuels and the experiments utilized to study them. This guide is designed to help you understand the characteristics of different rocket fuels and the specific outcomes of experimental tests, allowing for the effective elimination of non-compatible fuels based on observed data.

## Rocket Fuels

1. **Nitrous Oxide (N2O)**: 
    - Commonly used as an oxidizer in hybrid rocket engines. It offers simplicity in handling and storage.

2. **UDMH (Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine)**:
    - A hypergolic fuel often paired with oxidizers like nitrogen tetroxide. Known for reliability in rocket propulsion systems.

3. **Solid Kerosene-based Fuel**:
    - Utilizes kerosene as a primary component, solidified for easier handling in certain applications.

4. **Liquid Butane**:
    - Typically used in smaller propulsion systems or auxiliary applications. Offers ease of storage and low pressure requirements.

## Experiments and Outcomes

Below are the experiments conducted to analyze these fuels, alongside the specific outcomes that exclude certain fuels.

### 1. Exhaust Plume Spectroscopy
This experiment involves analyzing the exhaust gases emitted during combustion to determine the presence of certain compounds.

- **High water vapor detected**: This outcome does not rule out any specific fuel.
- **High CO2 content detected**: If observed, exclude Nitrous Oxide (N2O) and UDMH.
- **Metallic particles detected**: If found, exclude UDMH and Liquid Butane.

### 2. Soot Particle Detection
This test measures the level of soot generated during fuel combustion.

- **High soot levels**: Observing high soot levels eliminates UDMH as a potential fuel.
- **No soot detected**: If there is no soot, exclude Solid Kerosene-based Fuel.

### 3. Flame Color Observation
The color of the flame during combustion can indicate the presence of specific compounds or elements.

- **Bright blue flame**: This outcome does not rule out any specific fuel.
- **Green flame**: Observing a green flame excludes UDMH.
- **Orange flame**: This outcome does not eliminate any rocket fuel.

### 4. Fuel Odor Analysis
Involves assessing the smell of the fuel to gather initial insights into its chemical makeup.

- **Pungent odor**: This result does not eliminate any specified fuel.
- **Odorless**: If the fuel is odorless, exclude UDMH.

### 5. Emission of Toxic Gases Measurement
This experiment evaluates the toxicity of gases emitted during combustion.

- **High toxicity**: Does not rule out any particular fuel based on toxicity alone.
- **Low toxicity**: If the emissions demonstrate low toxicity, exclude UDMH.

### 6. Fuel Freezing Point Measurement
Determines the temperature range at which the fuel begins to solidify.

- **Freezing point between 50 and 100°C**: This range does not rule out any fuel.
- **Freezing point between 250 and 300°C**: This measurement does not eliminate any rocket fuels.

### Conclusion

This guidebook provides a systematic approach to analyzing rocket fuels through various experiments, allowing for effective elimination of non-compatible fuels. By understanding the relationships between the experiments and their outcomes, you can gain a clearer view of the potential applicability of each fuel for various rocket propulsion systems. Remember, these experiments do not confirm which fuels are compatible, but rather help in ruling out certain fuels to narrow down the possibilities.
