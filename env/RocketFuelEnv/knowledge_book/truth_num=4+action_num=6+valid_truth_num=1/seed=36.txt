# Rocket Fuel Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to provide a comprehensive overview of specific rocket fuels and the experiments used to analyze them. By understanding the relationship between various tests and their outcomes, one can effectively determine which fuels are unlikely based on experimental observations.

## Rocket Fuels Overview

1. **UDMH (Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine)**
   - A highly volatile and stable liquid propellant often used in combination with an oxidizer like nitrogen tetroxide.

2. **Liquid Methane (LCH4)**
   - A cryogenic propellant with a high energy density, known for its clean combustion properties.

3. **Solid Ammonium Nitrate-Based Propellant**
   - A solid fuel used in simpler rocket designs, with ammonium nitrate acting as the oxidizer.

4. **Monoethylhydrazine (MEH)**
   - A derivative of hydrazine, used in mono-propellant thrusters or in combination with oxidizers.

## Experiments and Their Rule-Out Conclusions

### 1. Exhaust Plume Spectroscopy
This experiment analyzes the emission spectrum of a fuel's exhaust plume to detect various components, which helps in ruling out certain fuels:

- **High water vapor detected**: This outcome does not rule out any specific fuels.
- **High CO2 content detected**: The fuels UDMH and MEH must be ruled out.
- **Metallic particles detected**: The fuels Liquid Methane and UDMH must be excluded.

### 2. Density Measurement of Fuel
This test measures the physical density of the fuel, which can be indicative of its identity:

- **Density in the range of 800-1000 kg/m³**: Liquid Methane must be excluded.
- **Density in the range of 70-80 kg/m³**: No particular fuels are ruled out.

### 3. Fuel Freezing Point Measurement
This experiment determines the temperature range at which the fuel transitions from liquid to solid:

- **Freezing point in the range of 50-100 K**: No specific fuels are ruled out.
- **Freezing point in the range of 250-300 K**: Liquid Methane must be ruled out.

### 4. Soot Particle Detection
This test involves detecting particulate matter in the exhaust, indicating the cleanliness of the burn:

- **High soot levels**: UDMH must be excluded.
- **No soot detected**: This outcome does not rule out any specific fuels.

### 5. Combustion Temperature Measurement
This experiment measures the temperature of the flame produced during combustion:

- **Temperature in the range of 3000-3500 K**: Liquid Methane must be ruled out.
- **Temperature in the range of 2000-2500 K**: No particular fuels are ruled out.

### 6. Flame Color Observation
This qualitative test involves observing the color of the flame, which can indicate specific chemical processes:
  
- **Bright blue flame**: The Solid Ammonium Nitrate-Based Propellant must be excluded.
- **Green flame**: The fuels Liquid Methane and UDMH must be ruled out.
- **Orange flame**: This flame color does not rule out any specific fuels.

## Conclusion

By conducting these experiments and observing their outcomes, you can systematically narrow down potential rocket fuels. This guide provided precise information on which fuels to eliminate based on each experimental result, ensuring rigorous fuel identification and analysis.
