## Rocket Fuel Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to introduce the basic properties and experimental analysis of various rocket fuels. The intent is to provide clear guidance on how different substances respond under specific experimental conditions. By understanding these relationships, you can effectively rule out specific fuels when certain outcomes are observed in experiments. This guide covers four primary rocket fuels and the experiments used to analyze them.

## Rocket Fuels Overview

1. **Diborane (B₂H₆)**
   - A compound of boron and hydrogen known for its high energy density.

2. **Liquid Oxygen (LOX)**
   - A cryogenic fluid used as an oxidizer known for its powerful reactivity.

3. **Liquid Ammonia (NH₃)**
   - A colorless gas with a strong pungent smell, used as a mild fuel.

4. **Liquid Methane (LCH₄)**
   - A highly efficient rocket fuel with low toxicity emission.

## Experimental Analysis

Below are the key experiments conducted to analyze these rocket fuels and the outcomes of each. The outcomes determine which fuels can be ruled out when specific states are observed. Remember, the states in each experiment indicate exclusions of respective fuels.

### 1. Soot Particle Detection

  - Rule out Diborane (B₂H₆) and Liquid Ammonia (NH₃).

### 2. Density Measurement of Fuel
- **Density between 800 and 1000 kg/m³:**
  - Rule out Liquid Ammonia (NH₃) and Liquid Methane (LCH₄).
- **Density between 70 and 80 kg/m³:**
  - No specific fuels ruled out.

### 3. Emission of Toxic Gases Measurement
- **High toxicity observed:**
  - Rule out Liquid Methane (LCH₄).

- **Odorless fuel:**
  - Rule out Liquid Ammonia (NH₃).

## Conclusion

By carefully analyzing the outcomes of these experiments, we can systematically eliminate certain rocket fuels based on specific observations. This guide serves as a comprehensive manual for identifying and ruling out fuels in relation to the conducted experiments. It ensures clarity and precision in differentiating between potential rocket fuel candidates during analysis and development processes.
