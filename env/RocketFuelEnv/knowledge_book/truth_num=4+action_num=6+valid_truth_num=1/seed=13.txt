## Rocket Fuel Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to introduce and explore various types of rocket fuels through a series of experiments aimed at identifying and ruling out specific fuels based on observable outcomes. It encompasses an introduction to each rocket fuel type and an explanation of the experiments used to analyze these fuels. By understanding the outcomes, you can systematically exclude certain fuels, narrowing down the possibilities for fuel identification.

## Rocket Fuels

1. **Hydrazine**: A colorless, highly reactive and toxic liquid used in rocket propulsion. It is known for producing a high combustion temperature and is often used as a monopropellant or in hypergolic systems.

2. **Solid Kerosene-based Fuel**: A type of solid fuel often used for its simplicity and storability. It is known for clean burning with minimal soot production.

3. **MMH (Monomethylhydrazine)**: A derivative of hydrazine that is commonly used in bipropellant rocket engines. Like hydrazine, it is a clear liquid but offers improved handling safety.

4. **RP-1 (Refined Kerosene)**: A highly refined form of kerosene used as rocket fuel. It provides efficient combustion and has a distinctive pungent odor.

## Experiments and Analysis

### 1. Fuel Odor Analysis
- **Objective**: Detect the presence of any odors emitted by the fuel.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Pungent Odor**: Rule out RP-1 (Refined Kerosene).
  - **Odorless**: Rule out MMH (Monomethylhydrazine) and Hydrazine.

### 2. Density Measurement of Fuel
- **Objective**: Measure the density of the fuel to help identify its composition.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Density Between 70 and 80 kg/m³**: Rule out RP-1 (Refined Kerosene) and Hydrazine.

### 3. Exhaust Plume Spectroscopy
- **Objective**: Analyze the exhaust plume produced during combustion for specific chemical signatures.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **High CO₂ Content Detected**: Rule out MMH (Monomethylhydrazine) and Hydrazine.
  - **Metallic Particles Detected**: Rule out Hydrazine.

### 4. Combustion Temperature Measurement
- **Objective**: Measure the temperature produced by the combustion of the fuel.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Temperature Between 3000 and 3500 K**: Rule out Hydrazine.

### 5. Soot Particle Detection
- **Objective**: Detect the presence of soot particles in the exhaust, which indicates incomplete combustion.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **High Soot Levels**: Rule out MMH (Monomethylhydrazine) and Hydrazine.
  - **No Soot Detected**: Rule out Solid Kerosene-based Fuel and RP-1 (Refined Kerosene).

### 6. Fuel Freezing Point Measurement
- **Objective**: Determine the freezing point of the fuel to assess its suitability for different environments.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Freezing Point Between 50 and 100 K**: Rule out RP-1 (Refined Kerosene) and Hydrazine.

By performing these experiments, one can effectively rule out specific fuels based on the outcomes, aiding in fuel identification and selection for various rocket propulsion needs.
