## Network Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a straightforward introduction to network protocols and inspection methods used in network analysis. It aims to offer a foundational understanding of these protocols and methods while outlining how certain inspection outcomes can help rule out specific protocols. The guide is tailored for networking professionals and enthusiasts seeking to enhance their comprehension of network behavior and diagnostics.

## Network Protocols

1. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
   - HTTP is an application layer protocol used primarily for transmitting web pages over the Internet. 
   - It operates over a client-server model, facilitating communication between web browsers and servers.
   - HTTP is known for its statelessness and traditional lack of encryption, although secure versions (HTTPS) do exist.

2. **VoIP Protocols (Voice over Internet Protocols)**
   - VoIP protocols enable voice communication and multimedia sessions over IP networks.
   - They typically include protocols like SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and RTP (Real-Time Protocol) for signaling and data transfer.
   - VoIP systems rely heavily on efficient packet routing and minimal latency.

3. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
   - DHCP is a network management protocol used to automate the assignment of IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices within a network.
   - It simplifies the administration of IP addresses by assigning them dynamically from a pool.

4. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**
   - ICMP is used for error messages and operational information regarding the status of the network.
   - Common applications include diagnostic utilities like ping and traceroute used for testing connectivity and routing paths.

## Inspection Methods

1. **Analyzing Packet Timing Intervals**
   - Examines the time gaps between packets in a network stream to diagnose network performance and behavior.
   - Outcomes:
     - (0.0, 0.1) Seconds: Rule out HTTP.
     - (0.1, 1.0) Seconds: Rule out VoIP Protocols.
     - (1.0, 10.0) Seconds: No protocols are explicitly ruled out.

2. **Analyzing Session Persistence**
   - Looks at whether a network session is maintained over time or terminated after single transactions.
   - Outcomes:
     - Persistent Session: Rule out DHCP and ICMP.
     - Non-Persistent Session: Rule out HTTP.
     - Sessionless: No protocols are explicitly ruled out.

3. **Analyzing Error Codes**
   - Involves checking error messages exchanged in network communication to determine protocol-specific issues.
   - Outcomes:
     - ICMP Error Type: Rule out HTTP and DHCP.
     - Application Error Message: Rule out ICMP.
     - No Error Detected: No protocols are explicitly ruled out.

4. **Checking for Encryption**
   - Verifies whether the data is encrypted during transmission, indicating secure communication.
   - Outcomes:
     - Encrypted: Rule out HTTP and ICMP.
     - Unencrypted: No protocols are explicitly ruled out.

5. **Inspecting Protocol Handshake Types**
   - Identifies the method by which a connection is established between devices in a network.
   - Outcomes:
     - Three-Way Handshake: Rule out DHCP.
     - No Handshake: Rule out HTTP.
     - Custom Handshake: No protocols are explicitly ruled out.

6. **Inspecting Data Transfer Modes**
   - Determines how data is transferredâ€”whether the connection requires setup and acknowledgment or is sent immediately without verification.
   - Outcomes:
     - Connection-Oriented: Rule out DHCP.
     - Connectionless: Rule out HTTP.
     - Hybrid: No protocols are explicitly ruled out.

This guide articulates how these inspection methods are invaluable in distinguishing specific network protocols. Understanding these exclusions can streamline network diagnostics and improve troubleshooting accuracy, empowering individuals to effectively manage and optimize network environments.
