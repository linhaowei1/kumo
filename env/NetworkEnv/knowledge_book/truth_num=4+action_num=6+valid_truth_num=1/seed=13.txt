# Network Analysis Guidebook

In this guidebook, we will explore several network protocols and inspection methods to help network professionals analyze and interpret network activities efficiently. This guide focuses on understanding and ruling out specific network protocols based on observed network inspection outcomes. Let's dive into the key network protocols and inspection methods discussed here.

## Network Protocols

1. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
   - UDP is a communication protocol used across the internet for time-sensitive transmissions like video playback or DNS lookups. It is known for being connectionless, meaning it sends packets without establishing a prior connection, which can lead to faster data transmission but with the risk of reliability and no guarantee of packet delivery.

2. **IPv6-only Protocols**
   - These refer to protocols designed to work solely with Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), which is developed to deal with the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. IPv6 incorporates enhancements like a larger address space and improved routing.

3. **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**
   - OSPF is a routing protocol used for finding the best path for packets as they traverse a set of connected networks. It's commonly used within larger enterprise network environments to enable efficient data routing through dynamic network paths and ensures that the route is stable and secure over a persistent session.

4. **SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)**
   - SCTP is a protocol designed for transmitting multiple streams of data simultaneously between two endpoints in a network. It is used in scenarios where reliable data transfer is crucial and supports a custom handshake mechanism different from the traditional TCP handshake.

## Inspection Methods

1. **Analyzing Error Codes**
   - This method involves examining error messages or codes generated by network devices or applications. Outcomes could reveal issues such as application-level errors specific to certain protocols (like OSPF). Observations:
     - When Application error messages are observed, OSPF can be ruled out.

2. **Inspecting Protocol Handshake Types**
   - Different protocols have various handshake mechanisms to establish communication.
     - A three-way handshake typically involves protocols like TCP, but here we focus on eliminating possibilities:
       - When a Three-Way Handshake is observed, UDP is ruled out.
     - Custom handshakes point toward exclusion characteristics:
       - When a Custom Handshake is observed, SCTP is ruled out (because itâ€™s typical of SCTP).

3. **Analyzing Session Persistence**
   - Examines whether sessions are maintained or temporary.
     - Persistent sessions keep a communication channel open, unlike sessionless transmissions that end after a single transaction.
       - When Persistent Sessions are observed, OSPF can be ruled out.
     - Sessionless simply means the communication doesn't keep a session active, ruling out:
       - When a Sessionless state is observed, UDP is ruled out.

4. **Examining Packet Size**
   - Analysis of packet sizes can indicate distinct network behaviors:
     - Packet Size between 1001 and 1500 bytes often excludes protocols like OSPF due to segment size preferences.

5. **Checking for Encryption**
   - Ensures that data is transmitted securely with protocols that utilize encryption.
     - When Encryption is observed, OSPF can be ruled out, as specific implementations may take precedence over non-encrypted alternatives.

6. **Examining Network Layer Protocol**
   - This involves checking whether a protocol operates over IPv4, IPv6, or both:
     - IPv4 overview in this context excludes IPv6-only protocols, since they do not operate over IPv4.

By combining knowledge of these inspection methods with network protocol characteristics, network engineers can effectively analyze network behavior and eliminate incompatible protocols based on the context provided by inspection outcomes, leading to efficient troubleshooting and optimization of network systems.
