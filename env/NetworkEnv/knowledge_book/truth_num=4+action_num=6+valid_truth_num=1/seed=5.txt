# Network Analysis Guidebook

In this guidebook, we'll introduce several network protocols and inspection methods. We will explore how different network protocols behave under specific inspection scenarios and outline which protocols can be excluded based on certain observations. Our focus is on ensuring that you understand the fundamentals of these protocols and the logic behind ruling out specific protocols during network analysis.

## Network Protocols

### 1. VoIP Protocols
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) refers to a group of technologies that enables voice communication over the Internet. Some widely used VoIP standards include SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and RTP (Real-Time Protocol). These protocols are designed to provide real-time voice and multimedia sessions over packet-switched networks.

### 2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
UDP is a connectionless protocol that allows data packets to be sent without establishing a prior connection. It is used for simple query-response communication and real-time applications like video streaming, where speed is preferred over reliability.

### 3. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
BGP is the protocol used to exchange routing information across the internet. It is a crucial component of how packets are moved from one network to another, especially in large-scale environments like ISPs. BGP is known for its role in maintaining a table of IP networks or 'prefixes' which designate network reachability among autonomous systems (AS).

### 4. OSPFv2 (Open Shortest Path First Version 2)
OSPFv2 is a routing protocol utilized within larger autonomous systems (internal networks). Itâ€™s built for IPv4 and operates by finding the shortest path to transmit packets between networks, employing Dijkstra's algorithm to compute this path.

## Inspection Methods and Analysis

### 1. Inspecting Protocol Flags
Protocol flags are used to control or monitor communication at the TCP/IP layer. By examining protocol flags, one can infer the behavior of protocols in the network.

- **Rule-Out:** If TCP flags are set, UDP can be excluded as it is a protocol that does not utilize TCP flags.

### 2. Checking for Encryption
Encryption ensures that the data transferred across networks remains confidential. Different protocols may use or abstain from using encryption.

- **Rule-Out:** When encrypted traffic is observed, BGP can be excluded since it does not traditionally use encryption.

### 3. Examining Network Layer Protocol
Networks can run on both IPv4 and IPv6. Some protocols are designed to operate specifically on one type.

- **Rule-Out:** When operations involving IPv6 exclusively are detected, OSPFv2 can be excluded because it only operates over IPv4.

### 4. Inspecting Data Transfer Modes
Data transfer modes may differ between protocols, being either connection-oriented or connectionless.

- **Rule-Out:** In scenarios where a connection-oriented mode is detected, UDP can be excluded because it operates as a connectionless protocol.

### 5. Analyzing Time To Live (TTL)
TTL is a field that specifies the lifespan or hop limit of a packet in a network. By analyzing TTL values, we can infer certain protocol behaviors.

- **Rule-Out:** When TTL values between 0 and 64 are observed, BGP can be ruled out. Typically, BGP routes are designed to exceed this TTL range.

### 6. Analyzing Session Persistence
This method inspects whether the communication sessions maintain persistence or not.

- **Rule-Out:** If a sessionless communication model is observed, UDP can be excluded.

## Conclusion

By understanding these protocols and inspection methods, network analysts can effectively determine the presence or absence of certain protocols in a network system. This guide provides clarity on how to exclude protocols based on different inspection outcomes, helping streamline the analysis process in network troubleshooting and management.
