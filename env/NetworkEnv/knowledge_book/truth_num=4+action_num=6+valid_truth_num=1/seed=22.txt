# Network Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to offer an introductory understanding of several key network protocols and inspection methods. It aims to present these technical concepts in a straightforward manner, explaining how various inspection outcomes can rule out specific network protocols.

## Network Protocols

### IMAPS (Internet Message Access Protocol Secure)
IMAPS is essentially IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) operating over a secure connection using SSL/TLS encryption. It is commonly used for retrieving emails with an added layer of security.

### IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
IMAP is a standard email protocol that allows remote access to emails stored on a mail server. Rather than downloading the email locally as with POP3, IMAP allows the user to view emails as they are stored on the server. It can be used in both secure (over SSL) and non-secure modes. 

### RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
RDP is a protocol used for remote access to a computer over a network connection. It provides users with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection, typically used for remote administration and support.

### VoIP Protocols (Voice over Internet Protocol)
VoIP protocols are used to deliver voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the internet. Common protocols include SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol).

## Inspection Methods and Rule-Out Logic

### 1. Inspecting Data Transfer Modes
**Purpose**: To ascertain whether communication is connection-oriented, connectionless, or uses a hybrid mode.

- **Connection-Oriented**: No specific protocols are ruled out.
- **Connectionless**: IMAP is ruled out.
- **Hybrid**: RDP is ruled out.

### 2. Checking for Session Initiation
**Purpose**: To determine whether a session initiation protocol is involved in the communication.

- **Session Initiation Detected**: No protocols are ruled out.
- **No Session Initiation**: RDP and IMAP are ruled out.

### 3. Examining Encryption Algorithms
**Purpose**: To identify the encryption algorithm in use.

- **AES Encryption Detected**: No protocols are ruled out.
- **No Encryption Detected**: IMAPS is ruled out.
- **Unrecognized Encryption**: No protocols are ruled out.

### 4. Analyzing Destination Port
**Purpose**: To inspect the destination port a protocol is using, which can reveal or suggest its type.

- **Port 80**: RDP and IMAP are ruled out.
- **Port 443**: RDP and IMAP are ruled out.
- **Other Ports**: No protocols are ruled out.

### 5. Inspecting Protocol Flags
**Purpose**: To check the presence of specific flags within the protocol packet, such as TCP flags.

- **TCP Flags Set**: No protocols are ruled out.
- **No TCP Flags**: RDP and IMAP are ruled out.

### 6. Checking for Tunneling
**Purpose**: To identify whether tunneling is being utilized in the communication.

- **Tunneling Detected**: IMAP is ruled out.
- **No Tunneling Detected**: No protocols are ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides a straightforward approach to network inspection by explaining how specific inspection outcomes can rule out the potential involvement of certain protocols. The understanding of this rule-out logic can significantly aid network analysts in narrowing down the protocols they need to focus on during their assessments.
