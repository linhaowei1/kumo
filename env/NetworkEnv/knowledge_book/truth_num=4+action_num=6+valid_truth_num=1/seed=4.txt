# Network Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to introduce you to specific network protocols and inspection methods, providing a clear understanding of how to interpret various outcomes in network analysis. In this context, we focus on ruling out certain protocols rather than confirming affiliations. Let's explore the details.

## Network Protocols

1. **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**:
   IMAP is a protocol used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail server. It's known for allowing users to view messages without downloading them onto their devices. 

2. **OSPFv3 (Open Shortest Path First version 3)**:
   This is a routing protocol used to distribute IP routing information throughout a single autonomous system within an IP network. OSPFv3 is designed to work with both IPv4 and IPv6 networks, but it is intrinsically associated with IPv6.

3. **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)**:
   L2TP allows the creation of VPNs and is designed to enable the transmittance of data securely across networks. It combines features of the earlier PPTP and L2F technologies.

4. **Video Conferencing Protocols**:
   These protocols support the transmission of video and audio data over networks, enabling real-time communication by providing features like video call initiation, media negotiating, and bandwidth management.

## Inspection Methods and Outcomes

### 1. Analyzing Authentication Methods

When evaluating authentication methods, outcomes can either rule out protocols directly related to certificate and password requirements or no authentication at all.

- **Password Authentication**: This does not rule out any specific protocol.
- **Certificate Authentication**: Rules out `IMAP`.
- **No Authentication**: Rules out `IMAP`.

### 2. Examining Network Layer Protocol

This inspection focuses on the type of IP protocol in use, allowing us to rule out certain routing behaviors.

- **IPv4**: Eliminate `OSPFv3`.
- **IPv6**: No exclusion, as `OSPFv3` operates on IPv6.
- **Both IPv4 and IPv6**: No protocols are ruled out.

### 3. Checking for Tunneling

The presence or absence of tunneling is crucial for security and connectivity reliability.

- **Tunneling Detected**: Rules out `IMAP`.
- **No Tunneling Detected**: Rules out `L2TP`.

### 4. Inspecting Protocol Flags

Protocol flags are indicators used to manage connections during data transmission.

- **TCP Flags Set**: Rules out `L2TP`.
- **No TCP Flags**: Rules out `IMAP`.

### 5. Analyzing Destination Port

This analysis can help identify the type of service the network is communicating with based on port numbers.

- **Port 80**: Rules out `IMAP`.
- **Port 443**: Rules out `IMAP`.
- **Other Ports**: No protocols ruled out.

### 6. Inspecting Data Transfer Modes

Transfer modes help discern how data moves across the network and can exclude protocols based on connection management styles.

- **Connection-Oriented**: No protocols are ruled out.
- **Connectionless**: Rules out `IMAP`.
- **Hybrid**: No protocols are ruled out.

### Conclusion

Using these inspection methods, network analysts can systematically rule out different protocols based on observed network behaviors and characteristics. This approach ensures that analysis remains focused and accurate in identifying the most appropriate protocols or highlighting potential issues in network configurations. Understanding these exclusion rules is vital in refining network assessments effectively.
