# Network Analysis Guidebook

Understanding and managing network performance is crucial for maintaining reliable network operations. This guidebook introduces four key network protocols and various inspection methods to help diagnose and optimize network performance. Through this guide, you'll learn how to rule out protocols based on specific inspection outcomes.

## Network Protocols Overview

1. **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**:
   - A distance-vector routing protocol used in local and wide area networks.
   - Primarily facilitates data routing on small to medium-sized networks by providing information on the shortest paths between routers.

2. **VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)**:
   - A technology that allows voice communication and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks.
   - Commonly used in telephony services like Skype or Zoom.

3. **EIGRP for IPv4 (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol for IPv4)**:
   - A dynamic routing protocol designed by Cisco for routing decisions within an autonomous system.
   - Known for its rapid convergence and scalability in IPv4 networks.

4. **SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)**:
   - A transport layer protocol combining features of both TCP and UDP.
   - Designed to transport Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks, offering reliable message-oriented communication.

## Inspection Methods and Outcomes

The following inspection methods help rule out non-relevant protocols, thereby narrowing down potential protocol issues or considerations based on specific outcomes.

### 1. Analyzing QoS Fields
- **Outcome:**
  - **Low Priority**: Rule out VoIP. This indicates that VoIP is not being prioritized in a low-priority network setting.

### 2. Examining Network Layer Protocol
- **Outcome:**
  - **IPv6**: Rule out EIGRP for IPv4. Since EIGRP for IPv4 does not support IPv6, it cannot be functioning if IPv6 is detected.

### 3. Inspecting Data Transfer Modes
- **Outcome:**
  - **Hybrid**: Rule out SCTP. SCTP can handle both connection-oriented and connectionless services simultaneously, indicating a hybrid transfer mode.

### 4. Inspecting Protocol Handshake Types
- **Outcome:**
  - **Custom Handshake**: Rule out SCTP. As SCTP uses a four-way handshake process, it does not conform to traditional handshake types and thus might be excluded when a custom handshake is detected.

### 5. Examining Packet Size
- **Outcome:**
  - **(1001, 1500 bytes)**: Rule out RIP. If packet size falls within this range, it suggests that RIP is not likely the protocol used, as RIP typically has smaller packets.

### 6. Analyzing Time To Live (TTL)
- **Outcome:**
  - **(0, 64)**: Rule out RIP. TTL values within this range can suggest the absence of RIP, which often uses these TTL ranges for its operations.

## Conclusion

By efficiently using these inspection methods and understanding the rule-out criteria for each protocol, network professionals can significantly narrow down network issues and enhance network performance. This guide serves as a practical resource to help you make accurate and informed decisions in network management.
