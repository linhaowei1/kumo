# Network Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Network Analysis Guidebook, a comprehensive guide designed to introduce you to a selection of fundamental network protocols and methods of inspecting network traffic. Understanding these protocols and inspection methods is essential for network professionals tasked with analyzing and ensuring the security and efficiency of network communications. In this guide, we outline several key network protocols and detailed inspection methods with clear indicators of when certain protocols can be ruled out based on observed outcomes.

## Part 1: Network Protocols

### L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)
L2TP is a tunneling protocol used to support virtual private networks (VPNs). It does not provide any encryption or confidentiality by itself. Instead, it typically relies on an encryption protocol like IPsec to secure the data being tunneled.

### VoIP Protocols (Voice over Internet Protocol)
VoIP is a technology that allows you to make voice calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular phone line. Common VoIP protocols include SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol).

### HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
HTTPS is an extension of HTTP, which is used for secure communication over a computer network. When browsing online, HTTPS ensures that the data sent between your browser and the website is encrypted, protecting sensitive information such as logins and credit card numbers.

### RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
RIP is a dynamic routing protocol used by routers to determine the best path for data transmission across an IP network. It uses hop count as a routing metric and is one of the oldest routing protocols still in use.

## Part 2: Inspection Methods and Rule-Out Criteria

### 1. Checking for Tunneling
Tunneling refers to the encapsulation of packets within another packet. This inspection checks whether data packets are being tunneled.

- **Tunneling Detected:** Rule out HTTPS.
- **No Tunneling Detected:** Rule out L2TP.

### 2. Analyzing Packet Timing Intervals
This method involves examining the time intervals between packets as they are transmitted. Different protocols exhibit characteristic timing intervals.

- **Interval (0.0, 0.1) seconds:** Rule out HTTPS.
- **Interval (0.1, 1.0) seconds:** Rule out VoIP Protocols.
- **Interval (1.0, 10.0) seconds:** No protocols to rule out in this range.

### 3. Analyzing Session Persistence
This inspection checks whether a protocol maintains a persistent session throughout communication.

- **Persistent Session:** Rule out RIP.
- **Non-Persistent Session:** Rule out HTTPS.
- **Sessionless:** No protocols to rule out.

### 4. Inspecting Data Transfer Modes
This method examines whether the protocol is connection-oriented, connectionless, or hybrid.

- **Connection-Oriented:** No protocols to rule out.
- **Connectionless:** Rule out HTTPS.
- **Hybrid:** No protocols to rule out.

### 5. Analyzing QoS Fields
Quality of Service (QoS) fields indicate the priority level of packets.

- **High Priority:** Rule out HTTPS.
- **Low Priority:** No protocols to rule out.
- **Best Effort:** No protocols to rule out.

### 6. Checking for Session Initiation
This inspection checks whether there is explicit initiation of a session, as seen in some protocols.

- **Session Initiation Detected:** Rule out RIP.
- **No Session Initiation:** No protocols to rule out.

## Conclusion

This guide is intended to facilitate your understanding of specific network protocols and how various inspection methods can rule out certain protocols based on observed traffic characteristics. By following the outlined inspection processes and exclusion criteria, network professionals can effectively analyze and manage network communications. Always ensure to complement this knowledge with practical experience and continuous learning to keep abreast of evolving network technologies.
