# Network Analysis Guidebook: Understanding Network Protocols and Inspection Methods

Welcome to the Network Analysis Guidebook, designed to introduce you to essential network protocols and inspection methods that can aid in effectively diagnosing and understanding network traffic. This guide will focus on four network protocols—VoIP, NFS, RIP, and IMAPS—and introduce various inspection methods to help you determine their presence or rule them out based on specific network attributes.

## Network Protocols Overview

1. **Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP):**
   - Used for delivering voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks.
   - Typically involves real-time audio and video, requiring low latency and reliable connections.

2. **Network File System (NFS):**
   - Allows users to access and manage files on remote systems as if they were local files.
   - Operates over numerous ports but is often associated with secure and high-speed networks.

3. **Routing Information Protocol (RIP):**
   - A distance-vector routing protocol used for managing router information within a local area network (LAN).
   - Engages in periodic broadcasts of routing information to ensure network paths are optimal and reachable.

4. **Internet Message Access Protocol Secure (IMAPS):**
   - An email retrieval protocol that enhances IMAP with SSL encryption to secure emails during transmission.
   - Used to manage and retrieve emails from a remote server, ensuring the privacy of communications.

## Inspection Methods

Network inspection is a crucial process for understanding which protocols are at play within a network. The methods outlined below will help you identify and rule out certain protocols based on specific characteristics or outcomes observed during network traffic analysis.

### 1. Analyzing Destination Port
- **Outcome:**
  - Port 80: Rules out NFS
  - Port 443: Rules out NFS
  - Other Ports: No protocols ruled out

This method involves examining the destination port numbers in network traffic. Ports 80 and 443 are typically associated with HTTP and HTTPS, respectively, which can rule out NFS if they are detected, given NFS typically uses other ports.

### 2. Analyzing QoS Fields
- **Outcome:**
  - High Priority: No protocols ruled out
  - Low Priority: Rules out VoIP
  - Best Effort: No protocols ruled out

Quality of Service (QoS) fields help prioritize network traffic. VoIP often needs high-priority handling for real-time communication. Therefore, if traffic is marked as low priority, VoIP is less likely to be in use.

### 3. Examining Encryption Algorithms
- **Outcome:**
  - AES Encryption Detected: No protocols ruled out
  - No Encryption Detected: Rules out IMAPS
  - Unrecognized Encryption: No protocols ruled out

This method involves checking for encryption within the data. IMAPS explicitly requires encryption, so its absence could rule it out as a potential protocol.

### 4. Analyzing Session Persistence
- **Outcome:**
  - Persistent Session: Rules out RIP
  - Non-Persistent Session: No protocols ruled out
  - Sessionless: No protocols ruled out

Examining session persistence involves understanding if sessions are long-lasting. RIP frequently renews session data, so persistent sessions may suggest its absence.

### 5. Checking for Session Initiation
- **Outcome:**
  - Session Initiation Detected: Rules out RIP
  - No Session Initiation: No protocols ruled out

RIP passively shares routing information and may not initiate sessions like other connection-oriented protocols. Detecting explicit session initiation could thus eliminate RIP as a possibility.

### 6. Examining Packet Size
- **Outcome:**
  - (0, 100): Rules out NFS
  - (1001, 1500): Rules out RIP
  - (101, 1000): No protocols ruled out

This involves evaluating packet size in network traffic. Certain packet size ranges can help identify or eliminate the presence of specific protocols based on typical data transmission characteristics.

## Conclusion

Understanding and analyzing network protocols is a complex task that requires careful observation and deduction. By using the outlined inspection methods, you can accurately rule out various protocols under specific circumstances, which is invaluable in maintaining and securing network operations. Keep in mind that protocol elimination requires evaluating multiple factors simultaneously, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of network communications.
