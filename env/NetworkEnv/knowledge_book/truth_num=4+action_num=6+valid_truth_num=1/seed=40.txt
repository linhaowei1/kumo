# Network Analysis Guidebook

In the field of network analysis, understanding various protocols and inspection methods is crucial for diagnosing and managing network traffic. This guidebook is designed to introduce key network protocols and inspection methods in a manner that is straightforward and easy to comprehend. Our focus will be on understanding how specific inspection methods can help exclude certain network protocols based on observed outcomes.

## Network Protocols Overview

### 1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
HTTP is a widely used protocol for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. It is primarily used for loading web pages and communicating web content between a server and a client.

### 2. Telnet
Telnet is a protocol used for accessing remote computers over a network. It allows for bidirectional, interactive text-oriented communication. However, it lacks encryption, making it less secure.

### 3. CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)
CDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Cisco to allow network devices to share information about themselves. It is used mainly by network administrators to collect and view information about locally attached Cisco devices.

### 4. TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
TFTP is a simple file transfer protocol that is designed for small, simple transfers. It is less robust than FTP and does not include user authentication or encryption.

## Inspection Methods and Rule-Out Outcomes

Each inspection method described below provides valuable insights into network traffic by helping eliminate certain protocols based on observed characteristics:

### 1. Inspecting Protocol Flags
Protocol flags within packets can reveal the types of engagements occurring. 
- **TCP Flags Set**: 
  - Rule Out: TFTP
- **No TCP Flags**: 
  - Rule Out: Telnet, HTTP

### 2. Analyzing Time To Live (TTL)
TTL is a counter that indicates the lifespan or hops a packet can travel before being discarded.
- **TTL Range 0-64**: 
  - Rule Out: CDP
- **TTL Range 65-128**: 
  - Rule Out: Telnet, HTTP
- **TTL Range 129-255**: 
  - No protocols specifically ruled out

### 3. Checking for Session Initiation
Identifying whether a protocol initiates a session can help rule out certain protocols.
- **Session Initiation Detected**: 
  - Rule Out: HTTP
- **No Session Initiation**: 
  - Rule Out: Telnet

### 4. Checking for Tunneling
Tunneling encapsulates a network protocol within another. This helps determine if certain protocols are being tunneled.
- **Tunneling Detected**: 
  - Rule Out: Telnet, HTTP
- **No Tunneling Detected**: 
  - No protocols specifically ruled out

### 5. Checking for Encryption
Encryption methods indicate whether data being transferred is secured.
- **Encrypted**: 
  - Rule Out: Telnet, HTTP
- **Unencrypted**: 
  - No protocols specifically ruled out

### 6. Analyzing Packet Timing Intervals
The interval time between packets can point towards the type of traffic movement.
- **Interval 0.0-0.1**: 
  - Rule Out: Telnet, HTTP
- **Interval 0.1-1.0**: 
  - No protocols specifically ruled out
- **Interval 1.0-10.0**: 
  - No protocols specifically ruled out

## Conclusion

By using the described inspection methods, network analysts can efficiently exclude certain protocols under given conditions, streamlining the process of protocol identification and traffic management. This guidebook serves as a stepping stone into the world of network traffic analysis by simplifying complex concepts into actionable insights.
