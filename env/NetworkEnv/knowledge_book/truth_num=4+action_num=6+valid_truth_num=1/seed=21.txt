# Network Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

Network protocols and inspection methods are crucial components in the management and troubleshooting of network systems. This guidebook serves as an introduction to some key network protocols and inspection techniques. We’ll explore each protocol and method, explaining what they are, how they function, and how you can utilize inspection methods to refine your analysis by ruling out unlikely protocols.

## Network Protocols Overview

### 1. Multicast Routing Protocols

Multicast Routing Protocols are used to send a single data stream from one source to multiple destinations simultaneously. These protocols are essential for applications like video conferencing and live streaming where the same data needs to be delivered to many recipients. However, when examining multicast group memberships, if no multicast group is detected, you can rule out Multicast Routing Protocols from your analysis.

### 2. RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol)

RTP is designed for delivering audio and video over IP networks, where real-time transmission is critical. It’s often utilized in streaming, video conferencing, and online gaming. When you analyze Quality of Service (QoS) fields and encounter low priority, RTP can be ruled out. Additionally, if the packet timing intervals observed are between 0.1 to 1.0 seconds, RTP should be excluded from consideration.

### 3. POP3S (Post Office Protocol 3 Secure)

POP3S is a secured version of the Post Office Protocol used to retrieve emails from a remote server securely. It encrypts email data during transmission. If no encryption is detected upon examining encryption algorithms, you can rule out POP3S as a candidate.

### 4. STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)

STP is used in network bridges and switches to prevent looping and ensure a loop-free topology in Ethernet networks. One key aspect is that STP frames are typically encrypted to support secure operations in networks. Therefore, if checking for encryption and encrypted data is found, STP should be ruled out. Moreover, if the Time to Live (TTL) is between 0 to 64 hops, STP can be excluded.

## Inspection Methods

### Analyzing QoS Fields

Quality of Service fields help in prioritizing different types of traffic on a network. When analyzing these fields, if packets are marked as low priority, RTP can be ruled out from the possible protocols in use.

### Examining Encryption Algorithms

This method involves checking the type of encryption being used. If it's discovered that no encryption is detected, POP3S needs to be ruled out since it inherently involves secure transmission of data.

### Examining Multicast Group Memberships

This inspection method focuses on detecting whether multicast group memberships are present. If no multicast group is detected, you can rule out Multicast Routing Protocols from your considerations.

### Analyzing Packet Timing Intervals

The timing intervals of packets can offer insights into the protocols being used. Specifically, if packet timing intervals fall between 0.1 to 1.0 seconds, RTP needs to be ruled out as this suggests other protocols may be in play.

### Checking for Encryption

Checking whether data is encrypted can help determine the protocols in use. If the data is encrypted, exclude STP from your analysis.

### Analyzing Time To Live (TTL)

TTL is a mechanism that limits the lifespan or hops of data packets across a network. If you observe a TTL between 0 and 64, STP can be ruled out.

## Conclusion

Understanding network protocols and effectively utilizing inspection methods can greatly enhance network analysis. By applying the rule-out rules presented in this guide, network analysts can more accurately identify and exclude unlikely protocols, streamlining the troubleshooting and management process. In practice, these methodologies will lead to more efficient operation and maintenance of network systems.
