# Network Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook introduces you to essential network protocols and inspection methods, providing an understanding of how to rule out specific protocols based on observed outcomes. When analyzing networks, it's crucial to efficiently identify which protocols are in use. Here, we focus on analyzing protocols such as LLDP, HTTPS, ICMP, and Multicast Routing Protocols through various inspection methods. Understanding these protocols and using precise inspection techniques can help in network troubleshooting and security assessments.

## Network Protocols

1. **LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol)**
   - LLDP is a network protocol used for network devices to advertise their identity, capabilities, and neighbors on a local area network (LAN), primarily facilitating interoperability and network management.

2. **Multicast Routing Protocols**
   - These protocols enable efficient routing of multicast data, which is destined for multiple destinations simultaneously, across a network. They help in reducing bandwidth usage by distributing a single stream of information to multiple recipients.

3. **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**
   - HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP, using encryption to secure data exchanged between a web browser and a server. It is crucial for protecting sensitive user information and maintaining data integrity.

4. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**
   - ICMP is used for diagnostic or control purposes in network environments. It sends error messages indicating whether a service is reachable or if a router needs to be reconfigured.

## Inspection Methods

1. **Analyzing Time To Live (TTL)**
   - TTL is a value in an IP packet that decreases as the packet moves from source to destination. The packet is discarded when TTL reaches zero. Various TTL ranges can help identify different protocols:
     - **TTL Range 0-64:** Rule out LLDP.
     - **TTL Range 65-128:** Rule out HTTPS and ICMP.
     - **TTL Range 129-255:** No protocols ruled out.

2. **Analyzing Authentication Methods**
   - Understanding authentication types used in protocols can aid in ruling out options based on network security:
     - **Password Authentication:** Rule out ICMP.
     - **Certificate Authentication:** Rule out ICMP.
     - **No Authentication:** Rule out HTTPS.

3. **Examining Multicast Group Memberships**
   - This method involves checking if the network is part of a multicast group:
     - **Multicast Group Detected:** Rule out HTTPS.
     - **No Multicast Group:** Rule out Multicast Routing Protocols.

4. **Examining Encryption Algorithms**
   - Encryption helps secure data transmission. Identifying encryption type or lack thereof can help narrow down protocols:
     - **AES Encryption Detected:** No protocols ruled out.
     - **No Encryption Detected:** Rule out HTTPS.
     - **Unrecognized Encryption:** No protocols ruled out.

5. **Analyzing Error Codes**
   - Error codes in network communication give insight into issues encountered, ruling out specific protocols:
     - **ICMP Error Type:** Rule out HTTPS.
     - **Application Error Message:** Rule out ICMP.
     - **No Error Detected:** No protocols ruled out.

6. **Analyzing Packet Timing Intervals**
   - The timing of packet exchanges can be indicative of the protocol in use as different protocols have characteristic timing patterns:
     - **Interval 0.0-0.1 seconds:** Rule out HTTPS.
     - **Interval 0.1-1.0 seconds:** No protocols ruled out.
     - **Interval 1.0-10.0 seconds:** No protocols ruled out.

By using these inspection methods, network analysts can effectively determine which protocols are not in use in a given network scenario, streamlining the troubleshooting process and focusing on potential security vulnerabilities more accurately. Understanding these methods facilitates better decision-making and network management.
