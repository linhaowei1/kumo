# Network Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook aims to introduce network protocols and inspection methods used in network analysis. It provides a straightforward exploration of these elements, emphasizing how specific inspection outcomes can be used to rule out certain protocols.

## Network Protocols Overview

Let's start with a brief overview of the network protocols discussed in this guide:

1. **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**: 
   - A dynamic routing protocol used for automating routing decisions and configuration. It works within an autonomous system and supports quick convergence, scalability, and enhanced troubleshooting capabilities.

2. **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**:
   - A protocol for secure communication over a computer network. It serves to encrypt communications, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity between applications and users.

3. **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**:
   - A protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time sessions that include voice, video, and messaging applications.

4. **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**:
   - One of the oldest distance-vector routing protocols that employ hop count as a routing metric to decide the best path to a network destination.

## Inspection Methods

Network analysis often involves using various inspection methods to examine network behavior and characteristics. Here, we outline these methods and explain how certain outcomes can rule out specific network protocols:

1. **Checking for Session Initiation**:
   - **Purpose**: To determine if a session initiation is detected.
   - **Outcomes and Rule-Outs**:
     - If **Session Initiation Detected**: Protocol RIP is ruled out as RIP doesn't involve session initiation.
     - If **No Session Initiation**: Protocol SIP is ruled out since SIP is typically associated with session initiation.

2. **Examining Encryption Algorithms**:
   - **Purpose**: To identify the encryption algorithms in use.
   - **Outcomes and Rule-Outs**:
     - If **AES Encryption Detected**: No protocols are ruled out based on this outcome.
     - If **No Encryption Detected**: Protocol TLS is ruled out as TLS relies on encryption.
     - If **Unrecognized Encryption**: No protocols are ruled out based on this outcome.

3. **Analyzing Packet Timing Intervals**:
   - **Purpose**: To understand the timing between packets.
   - **Outcomes and Rule-Outs**:
     - If intervals fall between **0.1 and 1.0 seconds**: Protocol SIP is ruled out, as SIP operates differently in terms of timing.

4. **Analyzing Time To Live (TTL)**:
   - **Purpose**: To assess the TTL value of packets.
   - **Outcomes and Rule-Outs**:
     - If TTL is within **0 to 64**: Protocols RIP and EIGRP are ruled out as they typically operate with higher TTL values.

5. **Analyzing Destination Port**:
   - **Purpose**: To determine the target port number of network packets.
   - **Outcomes and Rule-Outs**:
     - If the destination port is **Port 80**: Protocol TLS is ruled out. Normally, TLS communications are not directed to port 80, which is typically associated with unencrypted HTTP traffic.

6. **Checking for Encryption**:
   - **Purpose**: To verify whether data is encrypted.
   - **Outcomes and Rule-Outs**:
     - If **Encrypted**: Protocols RIP and EIGRP are ruled out since they are not typically used for encrypted data exchanges.
     - If **Unencrypted**: Protocol TLS is ruled out since TLS is inherently used for encrypted data exchanges.

## Conclusion

Understanding how different inspection methods and outcomes can help rule out certain protocols is essential in network analysis. By using the rules provided here, analysts can systematically narrow down potential protocols involved in networking activities, leading to more accurate diagnostics and solutions for network management and security challenges.
