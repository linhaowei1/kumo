# Network Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

In today's interconnected world, the ability to analyze and troubleshoot network communications is crucial. Network protocols govern data exchange processes, and inspection methods allow network administrators to ensure systems' reliability, security, and efficient operation. This guidebook outlines key network protocols and inspection methodologies while detailing how specific protocol attributes can inform protocol identification by ruling out some options.

## Network Protocols

Before diving into inspection techniques, let's look at the network protocols we'll discuss:

1. **NFS (Network File System)**: This protocol allows users to access files over a network similarly as if they were located on the user's local storage.

2. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: SMTP is used for sending emails across networks. It's a protocol that helps in the delivery and relay of mail messages.

3. **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**: RDP enables users to connect to another computer over a network connection, providing graphical interface access.

4. **SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)**: SCTP is a transport-layer protocol designed to transmit multiple streams of data between endpoints in a network, providing capabilities beyond standard TCP.

## Inspection Methods

Employing the following inspection methods can help narrow down which network protocol is being used by ruling out certain possibilities.

### 1. Analyzing Authentication Methods

Examine how a protocol authenticates communication:

- **Password Authentication**: No protocols are ruled out.
- **Certificate Authentication**: Excludes SMTP.
- **No Authentication**: Excludes SMTP and NFS.

### 2. Inspecting Protocol Handshake Types

This involves analyzing the approach a protocol uses to establish a connection:

- **Three-Way Handshake**: No protocols are ruled out.
- **No Handshake**: No protocols are ruled out.
- **Custom Handshake**: Excludes SCTP.

### 3. Analyzing Error Codes

Identify how error messages are communicated:

- **ICMP Error Type**: Excludes SMTP.
- **Application Error Message**: No protocols are ruled out.
- **No Error Detected**: No protocols are ruled out.

### 4. Analyzing Time To Live (TTL)

TTL indicates the lifespan or survivability of data packets:

- **TTL between 0 and 64**: No protocols are ruled out.
- **TTL between 65 and 128**: Excludes SMTP.
- **TTL between 129 and 255**: No protocols are ruled out.

### 5. Examining Multicast Group Memberships

Multicast technology allows packet transmission to multiple destinations:

- **Multicast Group Detected**: Excludes SMTP.
- **No Multicast Group**: No protocols are ruled out.

### 6. Inspecting Protocol Flags

Flags in protocol operations highlight particular transmission conditions:

- **TCP Flags Set**: Excludes SCTP.
- **No TCP Flags**: Excludes RDP, SMTP, and NFS.

## Conclusion

By utilizing these inspection methodologies, network administrators can discern which protocols are not in use based on specific observed states. This guide helps in eliminating certain protocol options while analyzing network traffic, therefore streamlining the troubleshooting and monitoring processes. Each inspection method provides insights into unique protocol characteristics, crucial for effective network management.
