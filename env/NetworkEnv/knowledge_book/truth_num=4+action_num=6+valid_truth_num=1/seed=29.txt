# Network Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to provide a clear understanding of certain network protocols and how various inspection methods can be used to analyze them. Each network protocol behaves differently, and understanding these behaviors helps in troubleshooting and optimizing network performance. The inspection methods help in deducing which protocols can be disregarded based on observables during the analysis.

## Network Protocols

1. **VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)**
   - VoIP is used for delivering voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It requires efficient handling of Quality of Service (QoS) to ensure clear and reliable voice transmission.

2. **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)**
   - IGMP is utilized in managing multicast group memberships in IP networks, especially for streaming media. It facilitates communication between devices and routers to understand which devices are part of a multicast group.

3. **OSPFv2 (Open Shortest Path First Version 2)**
   - OSPFv2 is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It operates within a single routing domain and allows for the dynamic exchange of routing information.

4. **POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)**
   - POP3 is used by local email clients to retrieve emails from a remote server over TCP/IP. It is a permission-based retrieval protocol.

## Inspection Methods

1. **Analyzing QoS Fields**
   - This inspection evaluates the priority levels assigned within network packets, helping manage traffic.

   - **Outcomes:**
     - If "High Priority" is observed, **POP3** can be ruled out.
     - If "Low Priority" is observed, **VoIP** can be ruled out.
     - The "Best Effort" category does not exclude any protocols.

2. **Analyzing Error Codes**
   - This method inspects error messages in network communications to understand protocol failures.

   - **Outcomes:**
     - If "Application Error Message" is observed, **IGMP** can be ruled out.
     - "ICMP Error Type" and "No Error Detected" do not exclude any protocols.

3. **Checking for Session Initiation**
   - This inspection determines whether a session initiation phase is present.

   - **Outcomes:**
     - If "No Session Initiation" is observed, **POP3** can be ruled out.

4. **Analyzing Session Persistence**
   - This method assesses whether a session is persistent or non-persistent.

   - **Outcomes:**
     - If "Persistent Session" is observed, **IGMP** can be ruled out.
     - "Non-Persistent Session" and "Sessionless" do not exclude any protocols.

5. **Examining Multicast Group Memberships**
   - This inspection checks whether multicast group communications are present in data packets.

   - **Outcomes:**
     - If "No Multicast Group" is observed, **IGMP** can be ruled out.
     - "Multicast Group Detected" does not exclude any protocols.

6. **Examining Packet Size**
   - This method inspects packet sizes for understanding traffic characteristics.

   - **Outcomes:**
     - If packet sizes fall between 1001 and 1500, **IGMP** can be ruled out.
     - Other size ranges do not exclude any protocols.

Through the application of these inspection methods, you can systematically identify which protocols are not applicable during a network analysis phase. This guide is designed to be a helpful blueprint for network professionals in assessing and managing network performance and security.
