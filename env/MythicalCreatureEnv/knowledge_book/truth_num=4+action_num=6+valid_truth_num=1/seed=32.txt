## Mythical Creatures

1. **Kelpie**
   - A water spirit from Scottish folklore, often appearing as a horse, believed to reside in lochs and rivers.

4. **Yeti**
   - Also known as the Abominable Snowman, the Yeti is a large, ape-like creature said to inhabit the Himalayan mountains, part of the lore of Nepal and Tibet.

## Methods for Identification

### 1. **Environmental Survey**
   - This method involves examining the habitat for signs or evidence of mythical creatures. The presence or absence of certain creatures can be inferred based on the habitat surveyed.

   **Elimination Outcomes:**
   - **Forest Habitat**: Kelpie must be excluded.
   - **Mountain Habitat**: Kelpie must be excluded.
   - **Aquatic Habitat**: No creatures are ruled out.
   - **Mixed Habitats**: No creatures are ruled out.

### 2. **Cryptozoological Footprint Analysis**
   - By examining footprints, one can deduce the potential presence of specific creatures. Footprints' size and form play a critical role.

   **Elimination Outcomes:**
   - **Large Footprints**: Gnome must be excluded.
   - **Small Footprints**: No creatures are ruled out.
   - **No Footprints**: Yeti and Centaur must be excluded.
   - **Mixed Footprints**: No creatures are ruled out.

### 3. **Oceanic Current Tracking**
   - This technique involves monitoring oceanic patterns and currents, which might be affected by mythical aquatic creatures.

   **Elimination Outcomes:**
   - **Unexplained whirlpools**: No creatures are ruled out.
   - **Calm seas**: Kelpie must be excluded.

### 4. **Magical Energy Measurement**
   - Measures ambient magical energy levels that might align with the presence of mythical beings.

   **Elimination Outcomes:**
   - **Energy Levels (0, 10)**: No creatures are ruled out.
   - **Energy Levels (10, 50)**: No creatures are ruled out.
   - **Energy Levels (50, 100)**: Gnome must be excluded.

### 5. **Magical Residue Detection**
   - Detects residual magical energies often left by mythical creatures, indicating their potential habitats or paths.

   **Elimination Outcomes:**
   - **Residue Levels (0.0, 3.0)**: No creatures are ruled out.
   - **Residue Levels (3.0, 7.0)**: No creatures are ruled out.
   - **Residue Levels (7.0, 10.0)**: Yeti must be excluded.
   - **Residue Levels (0, 20)**: No creatures are ruled out.
   - **Residue Levels (20, 50)**: No creatures are ruled out.
   - **Residue Levels (50, 100)**: Gnome must be excluded.

### 6. **Nest Investigation**
   - Searches for nests or dwelling places that certain mythical creatures might inhabit.

   **Elimination Outcomes:**
   - **High altitude nests**: No creatures are ruled out.
   - **Underground burrows**: Yeti must be excluded.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides a comprehensive framework for identifying mythical creatures by ruling out possibilities based on observed conditions. Understanding and applying these elimination outcomes accurately will enhance the clarity and accuracy of identifying these legendary beings. Remember, in the world of myth and folklore, context is paramount, so consider each method and outcome carefully.
