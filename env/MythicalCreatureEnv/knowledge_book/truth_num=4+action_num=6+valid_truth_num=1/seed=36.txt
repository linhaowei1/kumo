## Diagnostic Methods

### 1. Venom Testing
This method involves detecting the presence of venomous properties.
    
- **Elimination Outcome**:
  - If venomous properties are present, **Hydra** is ruled out.
  
### 2. Curse Diagnostics
This process is used to identify the presence or absence of curses associated with creatures.
    
- **Elimination Outcome**:
  - If no curse is detected, **Gorgon** and **Medusa** are ruled out, suggesting the creature may not be one of these famous cursed beings.
  
### 3. Hair Sample Testing
This involves analyzing samples to determine if the creature has fur or scales.
    
- **Elimination Outcome**:
  - If fur is detected, **Hydra** and **Gorgon** are ruled out, indicating the possible presence of **Medusa** or **Selkie** as these are the creatures linked with such traits.
  
### 4. Nest Investigation
This method inspects nest locations for characteristics that match mythical creature habits.
    
- **Elimination Outcome**:
  - If nests or burrows are found underground, **Hydra** is ruled out, hinting at the creature potentially being a **Gorgon**, **Selkie**, or **Medusa**.
  
### 5. Environmental Impact Assessment
This assessment looks for environmental changes that correlate with the presence of mythical creatures.
    
- **Elimination Outcome**:
  - If there are signs of drought, **Selkie** and **Hydra** are ruled out, as such environmental shifts do not align with their characteristics.
  
### 6. Folklore Comparison
This method compares the creature's traits with various global mythologies to identify its origins.
    
- **Elimination Outcome**:
  - If characteristics are consistent with European myths, **Selkie** is ruled out.
  - If characteristics align with North American myths, **Hydra** is ruled out.
  - If consistent with Oceanic myths, **Gorgon** is ruled out.

## Conclusions
By utilizing the aforementioned diagnostic methods, you can effectively rule out certain mythical creatures based on specific observed outcomes. This approach provides clarity and narrows down the possibilities, fostering a more accurate identification of these legendary beings. Always refer to the elimination outcomes after conducting each method to systematically exclude possibilities and identify the creature in question.
