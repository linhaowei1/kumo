## Identification Methods and Elimination Outcomes

### Feather Examination
This method involves analyzing feathers found at suspected creature sightings.

- **Feathers with magical properties:** No creatures are ruled out by this finding, meaning all creatures remain possibilities.
- **Normal bird feathers:** Rule out the presence of **Roc** as its feathers would not be ordinary, given its legendary status.

### Skin Shedding Discovery
Involves searching for skin sheddings to identify reptiles or other skin-shedding creatures.

- **Reptilian skin found:** Rule out **Basilisk**, as its mythology suggests it does not shed skin in a typical reptilian manner.
- **No skin shedding:** Eliminate the possibility of a **Centaur**, as it is part-humanoid and not expected to shed skin like a reptile.

### Cryptozoological Footprint Analysis
This technique focuses on analyzing footprints left behind by suspected creatures.

- **Large Footprints:** No deductions can be made as no creatures are ruled out.
- **Small Footprints:** No creatures are eliminated from consideration.
