# Guidebook to Identifying Mythical Creatures

This guidebook is designed to aid in the identification and elimination of mythical creatures based on various legends and observations. By employing different methods, one can discern the specifics of the mythical creature, narrowing down possibilities through a process of elimination.

## Mythical Creatures Overview

1. **Specter**: Often considered ghostly apparitions or spirits, Specters are characterized by their ethereal nature. They are usually associated with haunting particular locations.
    
2. **Troll**: Originating from Norse mythology, Trolls are often depicted as large, brutish beings that dwell in caves or under bridges. Legends describe them as creatures of the earth, embodying a rugged, enduring force.
    
3. **Yeti**: Also known as the Abominable Snowman, the Yeti is a creature said to inhabit the Himalayan regions. It is often described as an ape-like entity adapted to cold environments.
    
4. **Giant**: Giants are mythical beings known for their enormous size and strength. Various mythologies around the world feature giants as powerful entities often inhabiting mountains or remote areas.
    
## Methods of Identification

1. **Historical Record Examination**: This method involves delving into ancient texts, folklore, and existing historical records to determine the existence or mention of mythical creatures.
    
    - **Evidence in Ancient Records**: When historical records strongly suggest the presence of a creature, the Yeti is ruled out, as it has inconsistent historical documentation.
    - **No Historical Evidence/Mixed Evidence**: These states do not rule out any creatures.
    
2. **Magical Energy Measurement**: This involves assessing the magical energy levels in an area. Specific ranges of magical energy can suggest the presence or absence of certain mystical entities.
    
    - **Magical Energy (0-10)**: When the magical energy level reads between 0 to 10, it indicates the absence of Giants, as these creatures are often associated with higher magical energy levels.
    
3. **Astronomical Correlation**: This method observes celestial and astronomical events and their correlation with creature sightings. 
    
    - **Celestial Events Correlated**: If sightings align with celestial events, it suggests that Trolls are unlikely to be present, as their existence is not typically tied to such phenomena.
    
4. **Claw Mark Analysis**: Examination of physical evidence such as footprints and claw marks can help eliminate possibilities.
    
    - **Human-like fingerprints**: The presence of human-like fingerprints at a scene rules out both Trolls and Giants, which are either larger or feature more bestial characteristics.
    
5. **Blood Sample Analysis**: This involves analyzing blood samples for unusual properties, shedding light on the nature of the creature.
    
    - **Blood lacking magical properties**: If analysis shows a lack of magical properties, the Yeti is ruled out since it is believed to require magical properties.
    
6. **Weather Pattern Study**: This method involves examining changes in weather patterns that might be linked to mythical creature activity.
    
    - **Heat waves**: The occurrence of heat waves can exclude the Yeti, as it is a creature associated with cold, snowy environments.
    
### Conclusion

By systematically applying these methods and observing the resulting clues and exclusions, one can effectively narrow down the possible mythical creatures that may be present in an area. This approach, focusing on ruling out unlikely candidates, aids in deconstructing the mysteries surrounding these legendary beings.
