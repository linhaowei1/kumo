## Introduction

Mythical creatures have been a part of folklore and legends across different cultures for centuries. Each creature carries its unique attributes and mysteries. This guide provides a detailed understanding of how to identify certain mythical creatures using various methods. Crucially, it explains how specific observations can rule out certain creatures during the identification process.

## Mythical Creatures

### Bigfoot

Often described as a large, hairy, ape-like creature, Bigfoot is purported to inhabit forests, especially in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Known for its elusive nature, stories of Bigfoot have been passed down through generations, often featuring footprints and blurry photographs as evidence.

### Kelpie

A Kelpie is known from Scottish folklore as a shape-shifting water spirit inhabiting lochs and pools. It often appears as a horse and is associated with treacherous deceptions, sometimes portraying itself as a beautiful horse or a handsome man to lure humans to their demise.

### Sasquatch

Similar to Bigfoot, the Sasquatch is said to be a reclusive forest-dwelling creature. With roots in Indigenous North American legends, it is depicted as a large, bipedal humanoid with thick fur. Stories often highlight its extraordinary strength and elusive behavior.

### Elf

Elves are mythical beings associated with Germanic mythology, often depicted as being small, fair, and possessing magical abilities. They are known to inhabit forests and are frequently associated with whimsical and mischievous actions.

- **Residue Levels 3.0 to 7.0**: No exclusion.
- **Residue Levels 7.0 to 10.0**: Rule out Sasquatch.
- **Residue Levels 0 to 20**: No exclusion.
- **Residue Levels 20 to 50**: No exclusion.
- **Residue Levels 50 to 100**: No exclusion.
