## **Guidebook on Identifying Mythical Creatures**

This guidebook aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of identifying mythical creatures from various legends. We will focus on four mythical creatures—Wendigo, Lich, Leviathan, and Satyr—and the methods used to potentially rule them out as suspects when specific observations are made. This guide applies an elimination approach, meaning that when a particular state is observed, the listed creatures are excluded from being the cause of that observation.

## Mythical Creatures

### Wendigo
The Wendigo is a mythical creature said to inhabit the forests of northern regions such as Canada and the United States. The Wendigo is often associated with dark, cold environments and is described as a malevolent spirit with an insatiable hunger for human flesh.

### Lich
A Lich is a form of undead sorcerer who has achieved immortality through dark magic. Liches are often described as skeletal figures with immense magical abilities and are commonly associated with ancient, cursed ruins.

### Leviathan
The Leviathan is a legendary sea monster referenced in various mythologies. It is typically depicted as a massive creature that causes havoc in oceans, causing storms or calm seas depending on its state.

### Satyr
Satyrs are mythological creatures from Greek mythology, known for their association with forested, rustic environments. They are depicted as half-human, half-goat beings, often linked to indulgence, music, and revelry.

## Methods of Identification

To identify the presence or rule out the involvement of these mythical creatures, several methods can be utilized:

### Weather Pattern Study
#### Observations and Exclusions:
- **Sudden temperature drops:** This state allows all creatures to remain potential candidates since none are excluded.
- **Heat waves:** When heat waves are observed, the presence of a Wendigo is ruled out.

### Oceanic Current Tracking
#### Observations and Exclusions:
- **Unexplained whirlpools:** No mythical creatures are excluded, keeping all possibilities open.
- **Calm seas:** The Leviathan is ruled out due to its association with causing disturbances in the sea.

### Magical Energy Measurement
#### Observations and Exclusions:
- **Magical levels between 0 and 10:** No creatures are ruled out.
- **Magical levels between 10 and 50:** No creatures are ruled out.
- **Magical levels between 50 and 100:** Satyrs are ruled out due to their minimal association with high magical energy levels.

### Bone Remains Analysis
#### Observations and Exclusions:
- **Gigantic bone structures:** When such remains are found, Leviathan is ruled out.
- **Normal-sized bones:** No creatures are excluded from this finding.

### Nest Investigation
#### Observations and Exclusions:
- **High altitude nests:** No creatures are ruled out, retaining all possibilities.
- **Underground burrows:** The presence of a Wendigo is ruled out with this finding.

### Lunar Phase Correlation
#### Observations and Exclusions:
- **Activity during full moon:** The Leviathan is ruled out due to its association with oceanic behavior rather than lunar activity.
- **No correlation with lunar phase:** No creatures are ruled out from this observation.
