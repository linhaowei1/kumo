## Marine Ecology Guidebook

Welcome to the Marine Ecology Guidebook! This guide introduces four fascinating marine species and various ecological field studies used to explore and understand marine environments. Through careful observation and analysis, these studies offer insights into the habitats and behavioral patterns of marine life. Each study includes specific outcomes, which help us understand which species are not present under particular conditions. Let's dive in!

## Marine Species Overview

### Armored Catfish
The Armored Catfish is a freshwater fish known for its bony plates that protect its body. Typically found in tropical environments, this species is often excluded in areas with high chlorophyll concentrations and low debris accumulation.

### Comb Jelly
Comb Jellies are delicate, gelatinous marine organisms known for their iridescent cilia, which they use to swim. Acoustic monitoring has detected high-frequency sounds that exclude these jellies, indicating their absence. They are excluded in conditions with normal plankton levels.

### Warty Comb Jelly
Similar to the Comb Jelly, the Warty Comb Jelly also produces high-frequency sounds detectable in acoustic monitoring, leading to their exclusion. They are excluded in areas with normal plankton concentrations.

### Asian Clam
The Asian Clam is a small bivalve, typically inhabiting freshwater environments with varying salinity levels. It is excluded in low salinity gradients and is commonly excluded in regions with low marine debris accumulation.

## Ecological Studies and Outcomes

### Acoustic Monitoring
This technique involves recording underwater sounds to study marine life activity and environmental noise levels.

- **No Unusual Acoustic Signals:** No specific exclusions are made based on this outcome.
- **High-Frequency Sounds Detected:** Exclude Comb Jelly and Warty Comb Jelly.
- **Low-Frequency Sounds Detected:** No exclusions are made based on this outcome.

### Chlorophyll Concentration Measurement
Chlorophyll levels provide insights into the amount of algae and plant life in water bodies, indicating primary productivity levels.

- **0.0 - 2.0 ppm (parts per million):** No specific exclusions are made based on this outcome.
- **2.0 - 6.0 ppm:** No specific exclusions are made based on this outcome.
- **6.0 - 10.0 ppm:** Exclude Armored Catfish.

### Salinity Gradient Analysis
Salinity gradients can affect the distribution and behavior of marine species, particularly those in estuarine environments.

- **0.0 - 5.0 PSU (Practical Salinity Units):** Exclude Asian Clam.
- **5.0 - 20.0 PSU:** No specific exclusions are made based on this outcome.
- **20.0 - 35.0 PSU:** No specific exclusions are made based on this outcome.

### Marine Debris Survey
This study assesses the accumulation of debris, which can impact marine habitats and species.

- **High Debris Accumulation:** No specific exclusions are made based on this outcome.
- **Low Debris Accumulation:** Exclude Armored Catfish and Asian Clam.
- **Moderate Debris Accumulation:** No specific exclusions are made based on this outcome.

### Plankton Net Sampling
This method collects plankton to assess community composition and levels, which are crucial for understanding food web dynamics.

- **Normal Plankton Levels:** Exclude Comb Jelly and Warty Comb Jelly.
- **High Invasive Plankton Levels:** No specific exclusions are made based on this outcome.
- **Low Plankton Levels:** No specific exclusions are made based on this outcome.

### Sediment Core Analysis
Sediment cores are analyzed for pollutants, providing a historical record of environmental conditions and human impact.

- **Heavy Metal Contamination:** No specific exclusions are made based on this outcome.
- **Organic Pollution Detected:** Exclude Armored Catfish and Asian Clam.
- **Clean Sediment:** No specific exclusions are made based on this outcome.
