# Operating System Kernels and Benchmarking Guidebook

This guidebook provides an overview of specific operating system kernels and associated benchmarking and compatibility tests. The focus is on understanding how these tests influence the determination of kernel compatibility through exclusion criteria.

## Operating System Kernels

1. **DOS (Disk Operating System)**
   - An early operating system primarily used in personal computers. It is command-line based and does not support multitasking.
   
2. **iOS**
   - A Unix-based operating system developed by Apple for its mobile devices, known for its focus on user experience and security.
   
3. **HP-UX**
   - A UNIX operating system by Hewlett-Packard, tailored for HP's computer systems. It is known for its stability and robustness in enterprise environments.
   
4. **OpenBSD**
   - A secure, open-source UNIX-like operating system renowned for its emphasis on security, code correctness, and stability.

## Benchmarking / Compatibility Tests

Performance and compatibility tests help in identifying kernels that can be excluded based on certain observed outcomes. The following tests are used in this guide.

### 1. Startup Time Test
   - **Objective:** Measure the time taken for a system to boot up.
   - **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
     - If the startup time is between 0 and 10 seconds, exclude **HP-UX**.
     - If the startup time is between 20 and 60 seconds, exclude **iOS**.

### 2. Kernel Module Loading Test
   - **Objective:** Evaluate the ability to load additional modules into the kernel.
   - **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
     - If modules are loaded successfully, exclude **OpenBSD**.
     - If there is no module support, exclude **DOS**.

### 3. Memory Leak Detection Test
   - **Objective:** Detect memory leaks during kernel operation.
   - **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
     - If no memory leaks are detected, exclude **OpenBSD**.

### 4. Memory Usage Test
   - **Objective:** Analyze memory consumption by the operating system.
   - **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
     - If memory usage is between 512MB and 2048MB, exclude **DOS**.
     - If memory usage is between 2048MB and 8192MB, exclude **iOS**.

### 5. Driver Compatibility Check
   - **Objective:** Test the compatibility and successful installation of hardware drivers.
   - **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
     - If driver installation fails or drivers load with warnings, exclude **iOS**.

### 6. Interrupt Handling Test
   - **Objective:** Assess the system's ability to handle hardware interrupts.
   - **Outcomes and Exclusions:**
     - If interrupts per second count is between 5 and 10, exclude **DOS**.

## Interpretation of Test Results

When evaluating an operating system kernel, perform the appropriate tests and observe the outcomes. Utilize the exclusion criteria specified in this guide to rule out incompatible kernels effectively. This structured approach assists in narrowing down the selection by excluding those kernels that do not meet operational benchmarks or compatibility requirements.

By understanding and following these exclusion guidelines, you can better determine which OS kernels are unsuitable for your systems based on specific performance outcomes.
