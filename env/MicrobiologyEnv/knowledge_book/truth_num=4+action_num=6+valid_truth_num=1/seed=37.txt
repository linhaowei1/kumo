# Microbiological Analysis Guidebook

In this guidebook, we will explore the characteristics and experiments associated with a selection of unique microorganisms: Umbra, Zephyria, Glaciera, and Oceanus. The goal is to distinguish between these microorganisms by ruling out possibilities based on experimental outcomes. Let's delve into the experiments and their implications.

## Microorganisms Overview

1. **Umbra**: 
   - Specific characteristics and environmental preferences are to be determined through investigative experiments.

2. **Zephyria**: 
   - Known for its adaptability, yet certain environmental conditions may exclude its presence.

3. **Glaciera**: 
   - Resistant to cold environments with unique atmospheric requirements.

4. **Oceanus**: 
   - Displays preference for specific atmospheric compositions, which serve as exclusion markers.

## Experiments and Outcomes

The following are key experiments that can help in the analysis and identification of these microorganisms by excluding certain possibilities based on observed outcomes.

### 1. Atmospheric Composition Analysis

This experiment determines the primary components of an atmosphere and helps rule out the following microorganisms:

- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: No specific exclusions; all microorganisms remain potential candidates.
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Excludes **Zephyria**.
- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: Excludes **Glaciera**.
- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Excludes **Oceanus** and **Zephyria**.

### 2. Surface Temperature Measurement

This experiment assesses the surface temperature range where microorganisms may or may not thrive:

- **Temperature Range (-200, -50)°C**: Excludes **Glaciera** and **Umbra**.
- **Temperature Range (-50, 0)°C**: Excludes **Umbra**.
- **Temperature Range (0, 50)°C**: No specific exclusions; all microorganisms remain potential candidates.
- **Temperature Range (50, 100)°C**: No specific exclusions; all microorganisms remain potential candidates.
- **Temperature Range (100, 300)°C**: No specific exclusions; all microorganisms remain potential candidates.

### 3. Carbon Dioxide Concentration Check

This experiment measures the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere:

- **Concentration Range (0, 0.03)%**: No specific exclusions; all microorganisms remain potential candidates.
- **Concentration Range (0.03, 1)%**: No specific exclusions; all microorganisms remain potential candidates.
- **Concentration Range (1, 10)%**: Excludes **Glaciera**.
- **Concentration Range (10, 100)%**: No specific exclusions; all microorganisms remain potential candidates.

### 4. Liquid Water Detection

Determines the presence of liquid water, critical for certain microorganisms:

- **Liquid Water Present**: No specific exclusions; all microorganisms remain potential candidates.
- **No Liquid Water Detected**: Excludes **Oceanus** and **Zephyria**.

### 5. Stellar Flux Analysis

This experiment measures the stellar energy received:

- **Flux Range (0, 1)**: Excludes **Glaciera** and **Umbra**.
- **Flux Range (1, 1.5)**: No specific exclusions; all microorganisms remain potential candidates.
- **Flux Range (1.5, 3)**: No specific exclusions; all microorganisms remain potential candidates.

### 6. Methane Detection

Identifies the presence of methane in the environment:

- **Methane Detected**: No specific exclusions; all microorganisms remain potential candidates.
- **No Methane Detected**: Excludes **Glaciera**.

## Conclusion

By systematically applying these experiments and observing the outcomes, it becomes possible to narrow down the presence of a specific microorganism by ruling out those that cannot survive under the detected conditions. This guidebook should serve as a comprehensive tool for identifying the characteristics and eliminating possibilities in the study of Umbra, Zephyria, Glaciera, and Oceanus.
