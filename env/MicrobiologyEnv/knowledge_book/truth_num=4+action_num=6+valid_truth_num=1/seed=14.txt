# Microbiological Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Microbiological Analysis Guidebook, where we explore an array of experiments designed to investigate specific microorganisms: Mirage, Glaciera, Pandora, and Aurelia. This guide provides a detailed explanation of each experiment and how the results can help rule out certain microorganisms from our analysis. Our goal is to understand the environmental characteristics that shape these microorganisms' existence by conducting a series of scientific tests.

## Microorganisms Overview

1. **Mirage**
2. **Glaciera**
3. **Pandora**
4. **Aurelia**

Each of these microorganisms exists within unique environmental parameters. Our experiments aim to identify which microorganisms can be eliminated based on specific observed outcomes.

## Experiments and Observational Outcomes

### 1. Atmospheric Composition Analysis

This experiment studies the gaseous components of an environment's atmosphere. The outcomes will provide critical insights for ruling out certain microorganisms based on their adaptive characteristics.

- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: No microorganisms are ruled out.
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Rule out Aurelia.
- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out Glaciera.
- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out Aurelia.

### 2. Surface Temperature Measurement

This test determines the temperature range on the surface of a habitat, which can significantly affect microorganism viability.

- **Temperature Range (-200, -50)°C**: Rule out Glaciera.
- **Temperature Range (-50, 0)°C**: No microorganisms are ruled out.
- **Temperature Range (0, 50)°C**: No microorganisms are ruled out.
- **Temperature Range (50, 100)°C**: Rule out Mirage.
- **Temperature Range (100, 300)°C**: No microorganisms are ruled out.

### 3. Subsurface Ocean Detection

This experiment probes for the presence of liquid water beneath a surface, which supports various forms of microbial life.

- **Subsurface Ocean Present**: Rule out Glaciera.
- **No Subsurface Ocean**: No microorganisms are ruled out.

### 4. Solar Radiation Absorption Test

This test measures the degree to which solar radiation is absorbed in an environment, affecting microbial survival.

- **High Absorption**: No microorganisms are ruled out.
- **Moderate Absorption**: No microorganisms are ruled out.
- **Low Absorption**: Rule out Glaciera.

### 5. Stellar Flux Analysis

This experiment assesses the amount of stellar radiation received by an environment, influencing microorganism adaptability.

- **Stellar Flux (0, 1)**: Rule out Glaciera.
- **Stellar Flux (1, 1.5)**: No microorganisms are ruled out.
- **Stellar Flux (1.5, 3)**: No microorganisms are ruled out.

### 6. Magnetic Pole Reversal History

This historical analysis investigates the magnetic field dynamics of an environment, providing insights into its magnetic stability.

- **Recent Pole Reversal**: No microorganisms are ruled out.
- **Stable Poles**: No microorganisms are ruled out.
- **No Magnetic Field**: Rule out Glaciera.

## Conclusion

By performing these experiments, scientists can effectively rule out certain microorganisms based on environmental conditions and adaptability. This guidebook serves as a comprehensive resource to understand which microorganisms are unsuitable when specific experimental outcomes are observed. Each test offers a vital piece of data, collaboratively enabling precise decisions in microorganism identification and exclusion.
