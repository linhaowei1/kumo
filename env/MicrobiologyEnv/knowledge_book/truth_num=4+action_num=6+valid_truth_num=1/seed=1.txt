# Microbiological Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook outlines the fundamental microbiological analysis techniques used in examining potential microorganisms on various planets. For this analysis, we focus on four primary microorganisms: Eden Prime, Solaris, Zephyria, and Aurelia. Employing a series of experiments, we aim to rule out certain microorganisms based on the observed outcomes. Below, we detail each organism’s characteristics and the experimental procedures used to analyze their presence.

## Microorganisms Overview

### 1. Eden Prime
Eden Prime is considered a potential microorganism that might thrive under specific atmospheric conditions, particularly where carbon dioxide levels are predominant.

### 2. Solaris
Solaris is hypothesized to be adaptable to environments with a dense atmosphere and strong magnetic fields. It is also associated with methane-rich and nitrogen-rich atmospheres.

### 3. Zephyria
Zephyria is thought to exist in less dense atmospheres and might not withstand highly robust magnetic fields. It is commonly found in environments with high carbon dioxide and ammonia content.

### 4. Aurelia
Aurelia could potentially be present in conditions favoring high ammonia concentrations and carbon dioxide dominance, similar to Zephyria.

## Experiments and Outcomes

This section describes six crucial experiments designed to detect the presence of these microorganisms by ruling them out based on the outcomes.

### Experiment 1: Liquid Water Detection

- **Purpose**: To determine the presence of liquid water, which is vital for sustaining certain types of microorganisms.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Liquid Water Present**: No microorganisms are ruled out, suggesting all could potentially exist.
  - **No Liquid Water Detected**: Aurelia and Zephyria are ruled out; they cannot survive without liquid water.

### Experiment 2: Atmospheric Density Test

- **Purpose**: To analyze the atmospheric density of the environment.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Atmospheric Density (0.0 to 0.5)**: No microorganisms are ruled out.
  - **Atmospheric Density (0.5 to 2)**: No microorganisms are ruled out.
  - **Atmospheric Density (2 to 10)**: Solaris is ruled out due to the observed atmospheric density falling within the range that excludes it.

### Experiment 3: Presence of Organic Molecules Test

- **Purpose**: To establish the presence of organic molecules, essential for the sustenance of some microorganisms.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Organic Molecules Present**: No microorganisms are ruled out.
  - **No Organic Molecules Detected**: Solaris is ruled out, indicating it relies on organic molecules.

### Experiment 4: Planetary Albedo Measurement

- **Purpose**: To measure the planet's albedo, indicating how much sunlight the surface reflects.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Albedo (0.0 to 0.3)**: Solaris is ruled out as environments with low albedo exclude it.
  - **Albedo (0.3 to 0.7)**: No microorganisms are ruled out.
  - **Albedo (0.7 to 1.0)**: No microorganisms are ruled out.

### Experiment 5: Magnetic Field Assessment

- **Purpose**: To assess the planet’s magnetic field strength.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Strong Magnetic Field**: Solaris is ruled out, as the presence of a strong magnetic field excludes it.
  - **Weak Magnetic Field**: Zephyria is ruled out; it cannot tolerate weak magnetic fields.
  - **No Detectable Magnetic Field**: No microorganisms are ruled out.

### Experiment 6: Atmospheric Composition Analysis

- **Purpose**: To analyze the predominant gases in the atmosphere.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: Solaris is ruled out as it thrives in methane-rich environments.
  - **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Eden Prime, Zephyria, and Aurelia are ruled out as these conditions do not favor them.
  - **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: Solaris is ruled out as it cannot survive in methane-dominant air.
  - **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Aurelia and Zephyria are ruled out due to their intolerance of ammonia-rich conditions.

## Conclusion

By using these experiments, researchers can effectively narrow down potential microorganisms based on environmental conditions. This guidebook serves as a foundational reference for identifying the presence, or ruling out, Eden Prime, Solaris, Zephyria, and Aurelia in varying extraterrestrial environments.
