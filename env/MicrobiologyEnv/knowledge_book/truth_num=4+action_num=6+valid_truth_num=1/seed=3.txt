# Microbiological Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Microbiological Analysis Guidebook, where we introduce you to the microorganisms known as Pandora, Solaris, Neptunia, and Eden Prime. This guide provides instructions on conducting various experiments and interpreting the outcomes to rule out specific microorganisms. Understanding these processes will enhance your comprehension of planetary microbial life and its environmental interactions.

## Microorganisms Overview

1. **Pandora**: Known for adapting to environments with high oxygen levels.
2. **Solaris**: This microorganism is highly versatile and prevalent in nitrogen-rich and methane-rich atmospheres, often associated with volcanic activity and varying gravity levels.
3. **Neptunia**: Primarily found in environments featuring ice rings and low surface gravity.
4. **Eden Prime**: Common in carbon dioxide-dominant atmospheres.

## Experiment Descriptions and Outcome Analysis

### 1. Atmospheric Composition Analysis

This experiment involves analyzing the composition of a planet's atmosphere to ascertain its dominant gases. The results can help rule out certain microorganisms based on the atmospheric conditions:

- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out Solaris.
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Rule out Eden Prime.
- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: Rule out Solaris.
- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: No microorganisms are excluded in this scenario.

### 2. Oxygen Level Test

This test measures the oxygen levels within the environment, helping to exclude microorganisms unfit for certain oxygen concentrations:

- **0–10% Oxygen**: Rule out Solaris.
- **10–20% Oxygen**: No microorganisms are excluded in this scenario.
- **20–30% Oxygen**: No microorganisms are excluded in this scenario.
- **30–100% Oxygen**: Rule out Pandora.

### 3. Volcanic Activity Assessment

Assessing volcanic activity can be crucial, as some microorganisms thrive in volcanic environments:

- **Active Volcanoes**: Rule out Solaris.
- **No Volcanic Activity**: No microorganisms are excluded in this scenario.

### 4. Planetary Ring Composition Analysis

Understanding the composition of planetary rings can help in identifying or excluding microorganisms:

- **Ice Rings**: Rule out Neptunia.
- **Rocky Rings**: No microorganisms are excluded in this scenario.
- **No Rings**: No microorganisms are excluded in this scenario.

### 5. Ammonia Levels Test

This test evaluates ammonia levels in the environment, guiding us in ruling out incompatible microorganisms:

- **High Ammonia Levels**: Rule out Solaris.
- **Low Ammonia Levels**: No microorganisms are excluded in this scenario.

### 6. Surface Gravity Measurement

Surface gravity may influence the presence of certain microorganisms, and this experiment helps exclude potential life forms:

- **0.0–0.5 Gravity**: Rule out Neptunia.
- **0.5–1.5 Gravity**: No microorganisms are excluded in this scenario.
- **1.5–3.0 Gravity**: Rule out Solaris.
- **3.0–10.0 Gravity**: Rule out Solaris.

## Conclusion

By using this guidebook, you can perform detailed experiments to effectively exclude particular microorganisms based on environmental conditions observed. Each test outcome provides a strategic way to narrow down possibilities and deepen your understanding of extraterrestrial microbial ecosystems. Remember, exclusion of microorganisms based on observed states is a key approach in this context.
