# Microbiological Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook is designed to provide you with a fundamental understanding of how to analyze the presence of specific microorganisms through a series of experiments. We will focus on the following microorganisms: Borealis, Zephyria, Gaia, and Hydra. Various experiments will help identify and rule out certain microorganisms based on specific observed outcomes. This approach is designed to systematically narrow down possibilities by excluding microorganisms that do not fit observed environmental conditions.

## Microorganisms Overview

### Borealis
Borealis is a microorganism that is sensitive to a range of environmental factors. By examining the surface temperature and other environmental conditions, we can often rule out Borealis as a possible inhabitant in specific scenarios.

### Zephyria
Zephyria is unique in its reaction to magnetic fields, allowing us to eliminate it in scenarios where magnetic properties are outside its usual habitat parameters.

### Gaia
Gaia thrives in environments with very specific carbon dioxide concentrations, which allow us to rule it out based on the carbon dioxide levels detected.

### Hydra
Hydra can be ruled out through a variety of environmental factors, including ammonia levels, magnetic fields, organic molecule presence, and orbit stability.

## Experiment Descriptions and Outcomes

### Surface Temperature Measurement

In this experiment, we measure the surface temperature to rule out certain microorganisms:

- **Temperature Range: -200 to -50°C**
  - Rule Out: Hydra, Borealis
- **Temperature Range: -50 to 0°C**
  - Rule Out: Borealis
- **Temperature Range: 0 to 50°C**
  - No rule outs.
- **Temperature Range: 50 to 100°C**
  - No rule outs.
- **Temperature Range: 100 to 300°C**
  - No rule outs.

### Magnetic Field Assessment

Here, we evaluate the magnetic field strength to exclude microorganisms:

- **Strong Magnetic Field**
  - No rule outs.
- **Weak Magnetic Field**
  - Rule Out: Zephyria
- **No Detectable Magnetic Field**
  - Rule Out: Hydra

### Presence of Organic Molecules Test

This test checks for the presence of organic molecules:

- **Organic Molecules Present**
  - No rule outs.
- **No Organic Molecules Detected**
  - Rule Out: Hydra

### Ammonia Levels Test

The levels of ammonia are tested to rule out microorganisms:

- **High Ammonia Levels**
  - Rule Out: Hydra
- **Low Ammonia Levels**
  - No rule outs.

### Carbon Dioxide Concentration Check

Carbon dioxide concentration is measured, helping in ruling out certain microorganisms:

- **Concentration Range: 0 to 0.03%**
  - Rule Out: Gaia
- **Concentration Range: 0.03 to 1%**
  - No rule outs.
- **Concentration Range: 1 to 10%**
  - No rule outs.
- **Concentration Range: 10 to 100%**
  - No rule outs.

### Orbit Stability Check

Orbital stability can indicate the potential habitation of certain microorganisms:

- **Stable Orbit**
  - No rule outs.
- **Unstable Orbit**
  - Rule Out: Hydra

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides a systematic framework for analyzing and ruling out microorganisms based on various experimental observations. By applying these exclusion rules, researchers can effectively narrow down the list of potential microorganisms in a given environment. This analytical approach is vital in ecological studies and helps advance our understanding of microbial life under different environmental conditions.
