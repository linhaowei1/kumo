# Microbiological Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook is designed to help you navigate the process of identifying specific microorganisms based on a series of environmental tests. Included are four key microorganisms and six experiments that provide different outcomes to help rule out possibilities. This approach allows for a systematic elimination of microorganisms from consideration, based on specific environmental readings.

### Microorganisms
1. **Pandora**: A mysterious microorganism that thrives in high-oxygen environments.
2. **Vulcania**: Known for its resilience in extreme temperatures and atmospheric pressures, Vulcania is often ruled out in more moderate environmental conditions.
3. **Mirage**: Flourishes in warmer environments, but other aspects of its preferences are less defined in this dataset.
4. **Hyperion**: The characteristics of Hyperion are not detailed in the dataset and require further investigation.

### Experiments and Outcomes

#### Surface Temperature Measurement
This experiment involves measuring the surface temperature of the environment and can lead to the following exclusions based on the temperature range observed:

- **-200 to -50 °C**: No microorganisms are excluded.
- **-50 to 0 °C**: No microorganisms are excluded.
- **0 to 50 °C**: No microorganisms are excluded.
- **50 to 100 °C**: Rule out Vulcania and Mirage.
- **100 to 300 °C**: Rule out Vulcania.

#### Oxygen Level Test
An assessment of the oxygen level present in the environment can help narrow down potential microorganisms:

- **0 to 10%**: Rule out Vulcania.
- **10 to 20%**: No microorganisms are excluded.
- **20 to 30%**: No microorganisms are excluded.
- **30 to 100%**: Rule out Pandora.

#### Stellar Flux Analysis
This test measures the intensity of star-derived energy present in the environment:

- **0 to 1 W/m²**: No microorganisms are excluded.
- **1 to 1.5 W/m²**: No microorganisms are excluded.
- **1.5 to 3 W/m²**: Rule out Vulcania.

#### Atmospheric Pressure Measurement
This involves measuring the atmospheric pressure prevalent in the environment:

- **0 to 0.5 bar**: No microorganisms are excluded.
- **0.5 to 2 bar**: No microorganisms are excluded.
- **2 to 10 bar**: Rule out Vulcania.
- **10 to 100 bar**: Rule out Vulcania.

#### Radiation Level Measurement
This experiment measures radiation levels within the environment and helps in exclusion as follows:

- **0 to 10 rad**: No microorganisms are excluded.
- **10 to 100 rad**: Rule out Vulcania.
- **100 to 1000 rad**: Rule out Vulcania.
- **1000 to 10000 rad**: No microorganisms are excluded.

#### Sulfur Dioxide Concentration Check
The presence and concentration of sulfur dioxide in the environment can exclude certain microorganisms:

- **0 to 0.1 ppm**: No microorganisms are excluded.
- **0.1 to 1 ppm**: Rule out Vulcania.
- **1 to 10 ppm**: Rule out Vulcania.

## Conclusion
By systematically applying these experiments, you can effectively rule out certain microorganisms based on the environmental conditions you observe. Remember, the absence of a microorganism in the exclusion result indicates it may be present, but further tests may be needed to confirm its presence. Use this guidebook as a tool to help navigate and deduce the potential presence of these microorganisms in varying environments.
