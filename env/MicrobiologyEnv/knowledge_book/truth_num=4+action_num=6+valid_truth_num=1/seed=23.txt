# Microbiological Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to introduce you to the fascinating microorganisms: Vulcania, Zephyria, Desertus, and Umbra. Each of these microorganisms interacts uniquely with their environment, allowing us to study and identify them through various experimental observations. Below, we detail the specific experiments used in analysis and describe how observing different outcomes can help rule out specific microorganisms.

## Microorganisms Overview

1. **Vulcania**: Known for its adaptation to high seismic activity areas, Vulcania is associated with both nitrogen-rich and methane-rich atmospheres. However, one must consider other environmental factors to accurately rule out its presence.

2. **Zephyria**: This microorganism thrives where the atmosphere is rich in carbon dioxide and ammonia. It's an important factor to consider in environments devoid of the classic atmospheric compounds typical of the others.

3. **Desertus**: Adapted to environments with high solar radiation absorption, Desertus shares similar atmospheric characteristics with Vulcania but can be differentiated through light absorption and aurora activity analyses.

4. **Umbra**: This microorganism is unique due to its location in areas with no seismic activity and low solar radiation absorption. Umbra does not adapt to dynamic or energetically active environments.

## Experiment Details and Rules for Microorganism Identification

### Atmospheric Composition Analysis

This experiment helps ascertain the dominant gases in an atmosphere. The potential outcomes involve:
- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: Rules out Vulcania and Desertus when observed.
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Rules out Zephyria.
- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: Observing this composition rules out Vulcania and Desertus.
- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: When this outcome is observed, Zephyria is excluded.

### Aurora Activity Observation

This test observes auroral activities which are electromagnetic phenomena in high-energy environments.
- **Aurora Detected**: No microorganisms are explicitly ruled out by auroral detection, meaning further tests would refine identification.
- **No Auroras**: When auroras are absent, Vulcania and Desertus can be ruled out.

### Seismic Activity Monitoring

Analyzing seismic activity gives insight into the adaptability of microorganisms to tectonic movements:
- **High Seismic Activity**: Observing high seismic activity rules out Vulcania.
- **Low Seismic Activity**: No specific microorganism is ruled out in low seismic areas.
- **No Seismic Activity**: Absence of seismic activity immediately rules out Umbra.

### Ammonia Levels Test

Ammonia concentration in an environment can identify potential microorganism candidates.
- **High Ammonia Levels**: This outcome rules out Vulcania.
- **Low Ammonia Levels**: Does not specifically rule out any microorganisms.

### Solar Radiation Absorption Test

Evaluates how much solar radiation the environment absorbs, impacting microorganism survival:
- **High Absorption**: This outcome rules out Desertus.
- **Moderate Absorption**: Does not rule out particular microorganisms in moderate conditions.
- **Low Absorption**: When low absorption is detected, Umbra is excluded.

### Average Rainfall Measurement

Analyzing rainfall can differentiate the microorganisms based on their adaptability to moisture:
- **0 to 10 mm**: Both Vulcania and Desertus are ruled out if observed at this level.
- **10 to 200 mm**: This outcome alone does not rule out any of the microorganisms.
- **200 to 1000 mm**: Similarly, observation within this range does not single out any microorganisms for exclusion.

Through systematic analysis using these experiments and observations, scientists can efficiently narrow down environmental conditions to identify or rule out Vulcania, Zephyria, Desertus, and Umbra. Each of these tests, when employed together, provides crucial context for determining the presence or absence of these microorganisms in any given environment.
