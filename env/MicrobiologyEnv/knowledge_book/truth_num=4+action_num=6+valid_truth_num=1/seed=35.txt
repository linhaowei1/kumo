# Microbiological Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Microbiological Analysis Guidebook. This resource is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of specific microorganisms and the experiments used to analyze their existence or characteristics within various environments. The goal is to help you understand how certain outcomes from these experiments can rule out the presence of specific microorganisms.

## Microorganisms Overview

This guidebook focuses on four key microorganisms:

1. **Neptunia**: Generally associated with environments rich in subsurface water layers. Its presence is less likely in environments without significant liquid water beneath the surface or those with low atmospheric density.

2. **Elysium**: Known for thriving in atmospheres rich in ammonia. Environments that do not have high levels of ammonia are unlikely to support Elysium.

3. **Eden Prime**: Often related to environments where carbon dioxide dominates the atmospheric composition. Different atmospheric compositions can rule out this microorganism.

4. **Solaris**: Found in environments with unique characteristics, such as nitrogen-rich or methane-rich atmospheres, high ammonia levels, and toxic soil compositions. However, its presence is usually ruled out in environments with subsurface oceans.

## Experimentation and Analysis

The following experiments are utilized to analyze environmental conditions that may support these microorganisms. Each experiment outcome guides the exclusion of certain microorganisms based on the observations:

### 1. Atmospheric Composition Analysis
This experiment examines the constituent elements of an atmosphere.

- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: Rules out Solaris.
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Rules out Eden Prime.
- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: Rules out Solaris.
- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Rules out Elysium.

### 2. Subsurface Ocean Detection
This experiment checks for the presence of liquid water beneath the surface.

- **Subsurface Ocean Present**: Rules out Neptunia.
- **No Subsurface Ocean**: Rules out Solaris, indicating it cannot thrive without such an aquatic environment.

### 3. Seasonal Variation Analysis
This experiment assesses any seasonal environmental changes.

- **Significant Seasonal Changes**: No microorganisms are specifically ruled out.
- **No Seasonal Variation**: Rules out Neptunia.

### 4. Soil Nutrient Analysis
This analysis determines the nutrient content of soil.

- **Rich in Nutrients**: No microorganisms are specifically ruled out.
- **Poor in Nutrients**: No microorganisms are specifically ruled out.
- **Toxic Soil Composition**: Rules out Solaris.

### 5. Ammonia Levels Test
This test measures the concentration of ammonia in the environment.

- **High Ammonia Levels**: Rules out Solaris.
- **Low Ammonia Levels**: No microorganisms are specifically ruled out.

### 6. Atmospheric Density Test
This test evaluates the density of the atmosphere.

- **Atmospheric Density (0.0, 0.5)**: Rules out Neptunia.
- **Atmospheric Density (0.5, 2)**: No microorganisms are specifically ruled out.
- **Atmospheric Density (2, 10)**: Rules out Solaris.

## Conclusion

Understanding the exclusion criteria through these experiments allows for a more precise identification of the microorganisms present in an environment. By aligning the experimental outcomes with the rule-out conditions, you can efficiently determine which microorganisms cannot survive in a given environment and focus your analysis on the remaining possibilities. Use this guide as a reference for conducting and interpreting your microbiological investigations.
