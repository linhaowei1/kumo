# Microbiological Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Microbiological Analysis Guidebook. In this guide, we will explore a set of microorganisms and outline experiments that help in the process of identifying and ruling out these microorganisms based on specific environmental conditions. Understanding these processes is pivotal in microbiological research and exploration.

## Microorganisms Overview

In our current exploration, we are focused on the following microorganisms:

1. **Oceanus** - Known for thriving in extraordinarily high-water environments. Investigating its presence often requires examining conditions like substantial rainfall.

2. **Glaciera** - This microorganism is associated with extremely cold and low-density environments. It's often ruled out in warmer and denser conditions.

3. **Mirage** - An organism that might be found in warmer conditions, yet its presence is not directly suggested by a specific environmental condition in this guide.

4. **Solaris** - Adapted to high-temperature and higher gravitational environments. Often associated with elevated oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.

## Experiments and Their Outcomes

To determine which microorganisms are present in a given environment, we conduct a series of experiments. The results of these experiments help us exclude particular microorganisms from our findings based on the specific outcomes observed. Below is a detailed explanation of each experiment and the outcomes that lead to the exclusion of certain microorganisms:

### 1. Surface Temperature Measurement

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - **Temperature Range: -200 to -50°C**: Rule out **Glaciera**.
  - **Temperature Range: -50 to 0°C**: No exclusions are made.
  - **Temperature Range: 0 to 50°C**: No exclusions are made.
  - **Temperature Range: 50 to 100°C**: Rule out **Solaris** and **Mirage**.
  - **Temperature Range: 100 to 300°C**: Rule out **Solaris**.

### 2. Average Rainfall Measurement

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - **Rainfall Range: 0 to 10 mm**: No exclusions are made.
  - **Rainfall Range: 10 to 200 mm**: No exclusions are made.
  - **Rainfall Range: 200 to 1000 mm**: Rule out **Oceanus**.

### 3. Surface Gravity Measurement

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - **Gravity Range: 0.0 to 0.5 g**: Rule out **Glaciera**.
  - **Gravity Range: 0.5 to 1.5 g**: No exclusions are made.
  - **Gravity Range: 1.5 to 3.0 g**: Rule out **Solaris**.
  - **Gravity Range: 3.0 to 10.0 g**: Rule out **Solaris**.

### 4. Oxygen Level Test

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - **Oxygen Level: 0 to 10%**: Rule out **Solaris**.
  - **Oxygen Level: 10 to 20%**: No exclusions are made.
  - **Oxygen Level: 20 to 30%**: No exclusions are made.
  - **Oxygen Level: 30 to 100%**: No exclusions are made.

### 5. Carbon Dioxide Concentration Check

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - **CO2 Concentration: 0 to 0.03%**: No exclusions are made.
  - **CO2 Concentration: 0.03 to 1%**: No exclusions are made.
  - **CO2 Concentration: 1 to 10%**: Rule out **Glaciera** and **Solaris**.
  - **CO2 Concentration: 10 to 100%**: Rule out **Solaris**.

### 6. Atmospheric Density Test

- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - **Density Range: 0.0 to 0.5 kg/m³**: Rule out **Glaciera**.
  - **Density Range: 0.5 to 2 kg/m³**: No exclusions are made.
  - **Density Range: 2 to 10 kg/m³**: Rule out **Solaris**.

## Conclusion

This guide presents the relationship between environmental test outcomes and the exclusion of certain microorganisms based on these results. By systematically ruling out possibilities, researchers can more accurately determine the microbial composition of different environments. Understanding these experiments' details and corresponding exclusions is crucial for identifying the correct microbial presence. Always ensure that all conditions are carefully measured to make informed decisions based on these outlined rules.
