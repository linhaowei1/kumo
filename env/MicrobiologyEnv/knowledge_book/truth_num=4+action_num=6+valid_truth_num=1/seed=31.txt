# Microbiological Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook introduces you to the analysis of certain microorganisms using a series of scientific experiments. We will explore four distinct microorganisms: Oceanus, Eden Prime, Mirage, and Pandora. The experiments detailed herein will help narrow down the possible microorganisms present in a sample by ruling out those that do not fit the observed environmental data.

## Microorganisms Overview

1. **Oceanus** - A microorganism that tends to avoid environments with high ammonia levels and significant rainfall but does not survive **only** where liquid water is **absent**.

2. **Eden Prime** - Known for exclusion from environments dominated by carbon dioxide in their atmospheric composition.

3. **Mirage** - Can be excluded from environments with surface temperatures **within** the 50°C to 100°C range.

4. **Pandora** - Excluded from environments with an oxygen level lower than 30%.

## Experiments and Exclusion Criteria

### 1. Atmospheric Composition Analysis
This experiment determines the predominant gases in an atmosphere.

- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**: No exclusions.
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**: Excludes Eden Prime.
- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**: No exclusions.
- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**: Excludes Oceanus.

### 2. Surface Temperature Measurement
This experiment measures the environmental surface temperature.

- **Temperature Range (-200 to -50°C)**: No exclusions.
- **Temperature Range (-50 to 0°C)**: No exclusions.
- **Temperature Range (0 to 50°C)**: No exclusions.
- **Temperature Range (50 to 100°C)**: Excludes Mirage.
- **Temperature Range (100 to 300°C)**: No exclusions.

### 3. Oxygen Level Test
This experiment assesses the proportion of oxygen present in the atmosphere.

- **Oxygen Level (0 to 10%)**: No exclusions.
- **Oxygen Level (10 to 20%)**: No exclusions.
- **Oxygen Level (20 to 30%)**: No exclusions.
- **Oxygen Level (30 to 100%)**: Excludes Pandora.

### 4. Average Rainfall Measurement
This experiment measures the average amount of precipitation over a certain period.

- **Rainfall (0 to 10 mm)**: No exclusions.
- **Rainfall (10 to 200 mm)**: No exclusions.
- **Rainfall (200 to 1000 mm)**: Excludes Oceanus.

### 5. Liquid Water Detection
This experiment checks the presence of liquid water in the environment.

- **Liquid Water Present**: No exclusions.
- **No Liquid Water Detected**: Excludes Oceanus.

### 6. Seismic Activity Monitoring
This experiment observes the level of seismic activity in the environment.

- **High Seismic Activity**: No exclusions.
- **Low Seismic Activity**: No exclusions.
- **No Seismic Activity**: No exclusions.

## Conclusion

Each experiment is designed to provide critical clues about the possible presence of specific microorganisms by eliminating those that cannot survive or exist in the observed conditions. By following these exclusion guidelines and systematically performing the outlined experiments, researchers can effectively narrow down their options and gain insights into which microorganisms may be present.
