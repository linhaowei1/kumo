# Microbiological Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to this guidebook designed to help you understand the process of microbiological analysis using different experiments to identify certain microorganisms. This guide specifically covers four microorganisms – **Oceanus**, **Vulcania**, **Eden Prime**, and **Hydra** – and outlines the key experiments used to analyze them. The goal is to provide you with a method to systematically eliminate microorganisms based on observed experimental outcomes.

## Microorganisms Overview

### 1. Oceanus
Oceanus is known for thriving in environments with ammonia-rich atmospheres. It cannot survive where specific atmospheric and physical conditions, as defined by the accompanying experiments, are not met.

### 2. Vulcania
Vulcania is a resilient microorganism capable of existing in both nitrogen-rich and methane-rich environments. It encounters difficulties maintaining stability in environments with other conflicting characteristics.

### 3. Eden Prime
Eden Prime prefers carbon dioxide-dominant atmospheres. It is susceptible to exclusion in environments which display incompatible experimental outcomes.

### 4. Hydra
Hydra is adaptable to environments characterized by a nitrogen-rich atmosphere but struggles in unstable or differing cosmic, gravitational, and thermal conditions.

## Experiment Guide

Below is the guide for conducting experiments, along with descriptions of how each observable outcome influences the exclusion of microorganisms:

### 1. Atmospheric Composition Analysis

This experiment assesses the predominant gases in the atmosphere where a microorganism is found.

- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere:**
  - Rule out: Hydra, Vulcania
  
- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere:**
  - Rule out: Eden Prime

- **Methane-rich Atmosphere:**
  - Rule out: Vulcania

- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere:**
  - Rule out: Oceanus

### 2. Orbit Stability Check

This experiment checks the gravitational stability of the microorganism's environment.

- **Stable Orbit:**
  - No microorganisms are ruled out.

- **Unstable Orbit:**
  - Rule out: Hydra, Vulcania

### 3. Surface Gravity Measurement

This experiment measures the gravitational pull on the microorganism's surface environment.

- **Gravity Range 0.0 - 0.5:**
  - No microorganisms are ruled out.

- **Gravity Range 0.5 - 1.5:**
  - No microorganisms are ruled out.

- **Gravity Range 1.5 - 3.0:**
  - Rule out: Vulcania

- **Gravity Range 3.0 - 10.0:**
  - Rule out: Vulcania

### 4. Cosmic Ray Exposure Measurement

This experiment assesses the exposure levels of cosmic rays in the environment.

- **Cosmic Rays Range 0 - 10:**
  - No microorganisms are ruled out.

- **Cosmic Rays Range 10 - 100:**
  - Rule out: Vulcania

- **Cosmic Rays Range 100 - 1000:**
  - No microorganisms are ruled out.

### 5. Methane Detection

This experiment identifies the presence of methane in the environment.

- **Methane Detected:**
  - No microorganisms are ruled out.

- **No Methane Detected:**
  - Rule out: Vulcania

### 6. Surface Temperature Measurement

This experiment determines the temperature range that characterizes the microorganism's environment.

- **Temperature Range -200 to -50:**
  - Rule out: Hydra

- **Temperature Range -50 to 0:**
  - No microorganisms are ruled out.

- **Temperature Range 0 to 50:**
  - No microorganisms are ruled out.

- **Temperature Range 50 to 100:**
  - Rule out: Vulcania

- **Temperature Range 100 to 300:**
  - Rule out: Vulcania

## Conclusion

The experiments outlined provide a comprehensive approach to identifying and ruling out certain microorganisms by analyzing their environmental interactions. By carefully observing the outcomes, you can systematically narrow down potential candidates and better understand the conditions necessary for each microorganism's survival.
