## Microbiological Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook serves as an introductory reference for the study of four unique microorganismsâ€”Oceanus, Desertus, Zephyria, and Nova Terra. It outlines various experiments designed to analyze environmental factors, providing insights into which microorganisms might be ruled out based on the experimental outcomes. The intention is to facilitate a streamlined process for identifying potential microbial presences through systematic exclusions.

## Microorganisms Overview

1. **Oceanus**: Known for its potential association with ammonia-rich atmospheres.
2. **Desertus**: Typically correlated with nitrogen-rich and methane-rich atmospheres. It generally shows low to moderate levels of UV and radiation exposure tolerance.
3. **Zephyria**: Together with Nova Terra, tends to be found in carbon dioxide dominant or ammonia-rich atmospheres.
4. **Nova Terra**: Similar to Zephyria, this microorganism is related to environments with significant carbon dioxide and ammonia presence.

## Experiments and Outcomes

### 1. Atmospheric Composition Analysis

Exploring the atmospheric makeup helps understand which microorganisms are unlikely to be present based on the detected gases.

- **Nitrogen-rich Atmosphere**
  - Rule-out: **Desertus** is excluded if a nitrogen-rich atmosphere is detected.

- **Carbon Dioxide Dominant Atmosphere**
  - Rule-out: **Nova Terra** and **Zephyria** are excluded if a carbon dioxide-dominant atmosphere is detected.

- **Methane-rich Atmosphere**
  - Rule-out: **Desertus** is excluded if a methane-rich atmosphere is detected.

- **Ammonia-rich Atmosphere**
  - Rule-out: **Oceanus**, **Nova Terra**, and **Zephyria** are excluded if an ammonia-rich atmosphere is detected.

### 2. UV Radiation Level Measurement

Assessing UV radiation levels provides insight into environmental conditions hostile to certain microorganisms:

- **0 to 10 Units**
  - No microorganisms specifically ruled out in this range.

- **10 to 100 Units**
  - Rule-out: **Desertus** is excluded if UV levels between 10 and 100 are detected.

- **100 to 1000 Units**
  - No microorganisms specifically ruled out in this range.

### 3. Radiation Level Measurement

Radiation levels further help narrow down microorganism possibilities:

- **0 to 10 Units**
  - No microorganisms specifically ruled out in this range.

- **10 to 100 Units**
  - Rule-out: **Desertus** is excluded if radiation levels between 10 and 100 are detected.

- **100 to 1000 Units**
  - No microorganisms specifically ruled out in this range.

- **1000 to 10000 Units**
  - No microorganisms specifically ruled out in this range.

### 4. Aurora Activity Observation

Aurora activity can indicate magnetic or atmospheric conditions impacting microbial presence:

- **Aurora Detected**
  - No microorganisms specifically ruled out.

- **No Auroras**
  - Rule-out: **Desertus** is excluded if no auroras are detected in the environment.

### 5. Planetary Albedo Measurement

This measurement evaluates the reflectivity of a planetary body, significant for temperature and climate assessments:

- **Albedo 0.0 to 0.3**
  - Rule-out: **Desertus** is excluded if albedo measurements between 0.0 and 0.3 are detected.

- **Albedo 0.3 to 0.7**
  - No microorganisms specifically ruled out in this range.

- **Albedo 0.7 to 1.0**
  - No microorganisms specifically ruled out in this range.

### 6. Carbon Dioxide Concentration Check

Carbon dioxide levels in an environment can imply conditions conducive, or not, to certain microorganisms:

- **0 to 0.03%**
  - Rule-out: **Desertus** is excluded if carbon dioxide concentration is detected to be between 0 and 0.03%.

- **0.03 to 1%**
  - No microorganisms specifically ruled out in this range.

- **1 to 10%**
  - No microorganisms specifically ruled out in this range.

- **10 to 100%**
  - No microorganisms specifically ruled out in this range.

Through these analyses, researchers can systematically eliminate potential microorganisms based on environmental evidence, creating a clearer path to understanding which microbes might be most likely thriving in given conditions.
