# Star Observation Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook is designed to assist stargazers in identifying constellations by employing a variety of observational techniques. We will focus on four constellations: 'Large Cube,' 'Cube,' 'Crow,' and 'Regular Hexagon,' and the techniques to effectively differentiate between them. For each observation technique, we'll clarify which constellations can be ruled out based on specific outcomes.

## Constellations

1. **Large Cube**
   - A hypothetical constellation characterized by its large, cube-like appearance.

2. **Cube**
   - Known for its cubic shape, this constellation shares a similarity with the Large Cube but differs in specific properties.

3. **Crow**
   - This constellation lacks rotational symmetry beyond the order of 1.

4. **Regular Hexagon**
   - Distinguished by its hexagonal shape, this constellation contains at least one right angle.

## Observational Techniques

### 1. Angle Measurement

**Objective:** Examine the angles formed by the stars.

- **All angles equal**: No constellations are ruled out.
- **Contains at least one right angle**: This rules out the 'Regular Hexagon.' Observing a right angle excludes this constellation from possibilities.
- **No right angles**: No constellations are ruled out.

### 2. Planar Shape Test

**Objective:** Determine the dimensionality of the constellation.

- **Planar**: Identifying a planar shape rules out the 'Cube.' This constellation is not flat or planar.
- **Solid**: No constellations are ruled out under this classification.

### 3. Rotational Symmetry Order Test

**Objective:** Identify the order of rotational symmetry.

- **1**: Observing a symmetry order of 1 rules out the 'Crow.' This constellation does not exhibit more than this minimal level of symmetry.
- **More than 1**: No constellations are ruled out based on this outcome.

### 4. Volume Calculation

**Objective:** Calculate the apparent volume of the constellation using spatial arrangement.

- **Volume between 0.0 and 100.0**: Observing a volume in this range rules out the 'Large Cube,' indicating it must be larger or differently shaped to not fit this categorization.
- **Volume between 100.0 and 1000.0**: No constellations are ruled out by this range of volume.

### 5. Surface Area Calculation

**Objective:** Evaluate the surface area covered by the constellation outline.

- **Surface area between 0.0 and 100.0**: This observation rules out the 'Large Cube,' suggesting its configurations are beyond this surface area scope.
- **Surface area between 100.0 and 1000.0**: No constellations are ruled out within this surface area range.

### 6. Side Length Measurement

**Objective:** Measure and compare the lengths of the sides of the constellation.

- **All sides equal**: No constellations are ruled out.
- **At least one pair of equal sides**: No constellations are ruled out under this condition.
- **No sides equal**: No constellations are ruled out when no equal sides are observed.

## Conclusion

Through these observational techniques, stargazers can methodically eliminate certain constellations based on specific properties identified during star observation sessions. Utilizing angle measurements, planar tests, symmetry, volume, and surface area calculations can greatly enhance the identification accuracy. This guide should assist observers in narrowing down possibilities and gaining insight into the night sky's captivating formations.
