# Star Observation Guidebook

Welcome to the Star Observation Guidebook, where we introduce some intriguing constellations and the techniques you can use to rule them out through observational analysis. Here, you will find guidance on using various techniques to systematically identify the constellations- 'Rectangle', 'Regular Polygons', 'Scalene Triangle', and 'Large Cube', by understanding what cannot be seen and excluding possibilities through observations.

## Constellations Introduction

### Rectangle
A common and easily identifiable shape in the sky, the Rectangle constellation is quadrilateral, featuring four right angles. Its primary visual characteristic is that opposite sides are of equal length.

### Regular Polygons
Regular Polygons are closed plane figures with all sides and angles equal. They create a symmetric, balanced appearance in the sky. Notably, they have rotational symmetry greater than one.

### Scalene Triangle
The Scalene Triangle is a three-sided figure where all sides are of different lengths, and it lacks any equal sides or angles. It provides a distinctive and asymmetrical view.

### Large Cube
The Large Cube appears as a three-dimensional shape, typically recognized by its equal sides and right angles, resembling a box-like figure in the sky. Its defining feature is its volume and surface area which are distinct from planar constellations.

## Observational Techniques

### Side Length Measurement
This technique assesses the comparative lengths of the sides of a constellation to determine symmetries or lack thereof.

- **All sides equal**: If detected, rule out *Rectangle* and *Scalene Triangle*.
- **At least one pair of equal sides**: If observed, excludes the *Scalene Triangle*.
- **No sides equal**: Indicates the absence of a *Rectangle*.

### Convexity Test
Determine whether a constellation is convex (all points on the shape's perimeter point outwards) or concave.

- **Concave**: Observing this property rules out *Regular Polygons*, as they are inherently convex.

### Surface Area Calculation
Calculating the expanse of a visible surface aids in defining three-dimensional figures.

- **(0.0, 100.0)**: A surface area within this range excludes the *Large Cube*.
- **(100.0, 1000.0)**: No exclusions are applied in this range, so further analysis is necessary.

### Volume Calculation
An advanced method, used mainly for three-dimensional constellations like cubes.

- **(0.0, 100.0)**: If the volume falls within this range, *Large Cube* should be excluded.
- **(100.0, 1000.0)**: Similarly, does not lead to any exclusions.

### Rotational Symmetry Order Test
This assesses how the shape appears upon rotation, signaling its symmetry properties.

- **1**: Detecting only a single symmetry order rules out *Scalene Triangle*.
- **More than 1**: If more than one symmetry order is detected, exclude *Regular Polygons*.

### Presence of Right Angles Test
A straightforward technique to determine the presence of right angles in a constellation.

- **No right angles**: When no right angles appear, the *Rectangle* is not present.

By utilizing these observational techniques, you can quickly exclude possibilities and narrow down which constellations you are observing without any ambiguity. This guide ensures that every step enhances your star gazing experience by highlighting exclusions that refine your celestial exploration. Happy stargazing!
