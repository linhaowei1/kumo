## Constellations

### 1. Regular Pentagon
Imagine seeing a celestial shape that resembles a five-sided polygon. The Regular Pentagon constellation is a pattern that can be identified by its equilateral sides and the angles between them. However, presence of right angles may disqualify it from being a perfect regular pentagon in a strict geometrical sense.

### 2. Small Sphere
The Small Sphere constellation manifests as a simple, spherical pattern. It's a smooth pattern without edges or vertices. Its defining characteristic is its small surface area compared to other spherical patterns.

### 3. Regular Polygons
This constellation category represents any polygon with all sides and angles equal, such as triangles, squares, and decagons. Regular Polygons may include several familiar celestial arrangements, and often exhibit more than one order of rotational symmetry.

### 4. Large Cube
The Large Cube constellation is a prominent pattern known for its three-dimensional shape. With its large surface area, this constellation stands out among others with distinct right angles.

## Observational Techniques

### Convexity Test
This test determines whether the pattern appears as a convex shape. When applied:
- **Concave outcome**: The Regular Polygons constellation is ruled out.

### Presence of Right Angles Test
This technique identifies right angles within a pattern.
- **Contains right angles**: The Regular Pentagon constellation is excluded.

### Surface Area Calculation
By measuring a patternâ€™s surface area, we can determine its potential identity.
- **Surface area between 0.0 and 100.0**: Large Cube is excluded.
- **Surface area between 100.0 and 1000.0**: Small Sphere is excluded.

### Curvature Test
This method checks for curvature within the star pattern.
- **Has curvature**: The examination rules out Regular Polygons.

### Rotational Symmetry Order Test
This technique observes the number of times a pattern maps onto itself during rotation.
- **More than 1 order of symmetry**: Regular Polygons are precluded from consideration.

### Angle Measurement
This technique involves the detailed measurement of angles within the constellation.
- **Contains at least one right angle**: The Regular Pentagon is excluded during observation.

## Applying Observations

Observational techniques are essential for determining which constellations are not present by ruling them out based on certain outcomes. Understanding and applying these techniques enables precise identification by eliminating certain patterns from consideration. By following this guide, astronomers can enhance their ability to navigate and appreciate the night sky, distinguish celestial patterns, and foster a deeper connection with the cosmos. Happy stargazing!
