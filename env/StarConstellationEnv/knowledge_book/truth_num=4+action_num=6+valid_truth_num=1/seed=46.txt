# Star Observation Guidebook

Welcome to the Star Observation Guidebook, where we delve into the art of identifying constellations using specific observational techniques. In this guide, we'll introduce you to the constellations 'Torus,' 'Regular Hexagon,' 'Circle,' and 'Cylinder,' and we'll explore the techniques used to observe and exclude these celestial patterns based on different criteria.

## Constellations Overview

1. **Torus**: Imagine a donut-shaped pattern in the stars that circles back on itself. The Torus is a fascinating shape often depicted as having a circular center with a tube-like surface.

2. **Regular Hexagon**: This constellation forms a six-sided polygon with equal sides and angles, resembling a perfect symmetry of hexagonal shape in the sky.

3. **Circle**: The simplest of shapes, the Circle forms a perfectly rounded pattern. In celestial terms, it might be perceived as a circular collection of stars.

4. **Cylinder**: Visualize this shape as a long circular section, like a tube. It has a circular base and extends up without differentiating the ends in the celestial dome.

## Observational Techniques

To identify and rule out certain constellations, we use various observational techniques. Each technique evaluates specific features that allow us to exclude certain constellations from consideration.

### Number of Sides Test

- **0 Sides**: If a pattern is identified as having zero sides, it may resemble a circle and thus the 'Circle' constellation must be ruled out.
- **1 Side**: A pattern with one continuous side could exclude both 'Torus' and 'Cylinder,' as they are complex, curvilinear constellations.

### Symmetry Tests

- **No Lines of Symmetry**: If no symmetry is apparent, all constellations remain in consideration.
- **One Line of Symmetry**: A single symmetric pattern indicates exclusion of the 'Circle' constellation.
- **Multiple Lines of Symmetry**: In cases where a pattern has multiple lines of symmetry, none of our constellations get excluded, as they all could potentially have such a symmetry.

### Planar Shape Test

- **Planar**: When a pattern lies flat in one plane, no exclusions are implemented.
- **Solid**: If a constellation demonstrates three-dimensional solidity, the 'Circle' must be excluded from consideration.

### Angle Measurement

- **All Angles Equal**: Should all angles in a constellation appear equal, no exclusions rely on this observation.
- **Contains at Least One Right Angle**: If there are right angles, exclude both 'Circle' and 'Regular Hexagon' from the considered list of constellations.
- **No Right Angles**: The absence of right angles leaves all constellations in play.

### Curvature Test

- **Has Curvature**: A pattern with noticeable curvature does not lead to any exclusions.
- **No Curvature**: Absence of curvature allows us to rule out the 'Circle' and 'Cylinder' as possibilities.

### Volume Calculation

- **Between 0.0 and 100.0**: Patterns fitting within these volumetric measurements do not exclude any constellation candidates.
- **Between 100.0 and 1000.0**: Similarly, no exclusions are made here regarding constellation identifications.

This guidebook offers a structured approach to star observation using exclusion rules to narrow down potential constellation identities based on observed patterns. By applying this systematic methodology, you enhance your celestial exploration skills and increase the accuracy of your star charting endeavors. Happy stargazing!
