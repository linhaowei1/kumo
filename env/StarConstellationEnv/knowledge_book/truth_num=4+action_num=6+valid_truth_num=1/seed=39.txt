# Star Observation Guidebook

Welcome to the Star Observation Guidebook, a comprehensive resource designed to help you identify and differentiate constellations using various observational techniques. This guidebook introduces four specific constellations and provides a clear understanding of how to apply different observational techniques to rule out each constellation based on your observations.

## Constellations

**1. Cylinder**
- The Cylinder constellation is characterized by its elongated shape with circular bases connected by a curved surface.

**2. Regular Hexagon**
- The Regular Hexagon constellation forms a six-sided polygon where all sides and internal angles are equal.

**3. Small Sphere**
- The Small Sphere constellation is distinguished by its perfectly round shape and smooth surface.

**4. Large Cube**
- The Large Cube constellation is a three-dimensional shape with six equal square faces, making it angular and box-like.

## Observational Techniques

### 1. Number of Sides Test
- This technique involves counting the number of visible sides within the constellation shape.
  - **Exclusion Rule:** If you observe one side, rule out the Cylinder constellation.

### 2. Angle Measurement
- This technique requires measuring the internal angles of the constellation's pattern.
  - **Exclusion Rule:** If the pattern contains at least one right angle, rule out the Regular Hexagon constellation.

### 3. Surface Area Calculation
- This technique involves calculating the surface area of the constellation's shape.
  - **Exclusion Rule:** 
    - If the calculated surface area falls between 0.0 and 100.0, exclude the Large Cube constellation.
    - If the surface area is between 100.0 and 1000.0, exclude the Small Sphere constellation.

### 4. Volume Calculation
- This technique calculates the volume enclosed by the constellation's structure.
  - **Exclusion Rule:** 
    - For volumes between 0.0 and 100.0, the Large Cube constellation should be ruled out.
    - For volumes from 100.0 to 1000.0, exclude the Small Sphere constellation.

### 5. Curvature Test
- This test assesses whether the constellation's shape has any curvature.
  - **Exclusion Rule:** If no curvature is present, rule out the Cylinder constellation.

### 6. Diagonals Equal Length Test
- This technique examines if the diagonals in the constellation's structure are of equal length.
  - **Exclusion Rule:** All constellations will remain as this observation does not specifically rule out any within the provided context.

## How to Use This Guide
To effectively use this guidebook in identifying and ruling out specific constellations, follow these straightforward steps:
- **Select a constellation**: Choose a constellation you wish to observe from the list.
- **Apply techniques**: Use each observational technique methodically on your chosen constellation.
- **Analyze results**: Based on the observed outcomes from each technique, apply the exclusion rules provided.
- **Determine exclusions**: Use the exclusion rules to systematically eliminate constellations that do not fit the observed criteria.

This structured approach ensures a high degree of accuracy in identifying what constellations are not in the sky, streamlining the pathway to identifying what might still be present. Enjoy your star gazing journey!
