# Star Observation Guidebook

Welcome to the Star Observation Guidebook, designed to enhance your stargazing experience by identifying and distinguishing between different constellations. In this guidebook, we will introduce you to four unique constellations—Crescent, Cube, Kite, and Large Cylinder—and outline the observational techniques that can be used to rule them out based on specific observed states.

## Constellations Overview

1. **Crescent**:
   - The Crescent constellation resembles the familiar curved shape similar to a crescent moon.
   - Key Characteristics: Typically convex in shape.

2. **Cube**:
   - As the name suggests, this constellation forms a perfect cube shape.
   - Key Characteristics: Defined by its planar shape.

3. **Kite**:
   - This constellation resembles a traditional diamond-shaped kite flying in the sky.
   - Key Characteristics: Known for having multiple lines of symmetry and all sides of equal length.

4. **Large Cylinder**:
   - The Large Cylinder constellation mirrors the elongated shape of a cylindrical object.
   - Key Characteristics: Falls within certain dimensions for surface area and volume measurements.

## Observational Techniques

1. **Symmetry Tests**:
   - A technique that determines the number of symmetry lines a constellation has.
   - Rule-Outs:
     - If multiple lines of symmetry are observed, you can rule out the "Kite" constellation.

2. **Convexity Test**:
   - This test checks whether the edges of the constellation curve inward or outward.
   - Rule-Outs:
     - If the constellation is convex, you can rule out "Crescent".
     
3. **Surface Area Calculation**:
   - This involves calculating the perceived surface area of the constellation.
   - Rule-Outs:
     - If the surface area falls between 0.0 and 100.0, you can rule out "Large Cylinder".

4. **Volume Calculation**:
   - This technique involves estimating the perceived volume.
   - Rule-Outs:
     - If the volume is calculated to be within 0.0 and 100.0, you can rule out "Large Cylinder".

5. **Planar Shape Test**:
   - Determines if a constellation forms a flat shape.
   - Rule-Outs:
     - If a planar shape is observed, you can rule out the "Cube" constellation.

6. **Side Length Measurement**:
   - This technique evaluates the equality of side lengths within the constellation's shape.
   - Rule-Outs:
     - If all sides are of equal length, you can rule out "Kite".

By applying these observational techniques, you can effectively narrow down the possibilities and identify which certain constellations are not visible based on different observed states. Use this guide to enhance your stargazing experiences by ruling out constellations methodically and enjoy the marvels of the night sky.
