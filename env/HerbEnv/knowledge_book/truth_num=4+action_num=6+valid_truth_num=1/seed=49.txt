# The Alchemist's Codex: Crafting Healing Elixirs

Welcome, aspiring alchemist, to the world of healing elixirs! This guidebook serves to introduce you to mystical plants and experiments that will transform your concoctions from mere mixtures into potent potions. Dive into the knowledge of rare ingredients and precise experimentation to unlock their hidden properties.

## Mystical Plants

Within your grasp are four mystical plants, each with unique properties that contribute to the art of healing:

1. **Goblin's Cap**: Known for its curious green hue and cap-like structure, this plant thrives in shadowy forests. It is believed to enhance resilience and offer protection against maladies.

2. **Moonshade**: A mysterious plant that blooms under the moonlight, Moonshade is reputed to possess calming properties and aid in spiritual rejuvenation.

3. **Ironwood Bark**: Harvested from the mighty Ironwood tree, this bark embodies strength and stability. Often used in fortifying brews, it provides a grounding essence.

4. **Firebloom**: With its vibrant colors and fiery appearance, Firebloom is renowned for its invigorating and energizing effects. This plant is a favorite among those crafting elixirs for vitality and warmth.

## Herb Testing and Brewing Experiments

To unlock the true potential of these mystical plants, one must conduct a series of experiments. Each test provides valuable insights by identifying which plants do not exhibit certain properties.

### 1. Color Change Test

- **Turns Red**: Rule Out “Moonshade”
- **Turns Blue**: Rule Out “Firebloom”
- **Turns Green**: Rule Out “Goblin's Cap”
- **No Change**: Rule Out “Ironwood Bark”

By observing the color change in the solution, we can determine which plants are not present. For example, if the solution turns red, Moonshade has been excluded as a possibility.

### 2. Flame Reaction

- **Green Flames**: Rule Out “Firebloom”
- **Blue Flames**: Rule Out “Moonshade”
- **Red Flames**: No known exclusions

When the plant is ignited, the color of the flame reveals the absence of certain plants. Green flames, for instance, suggest that Firebloom is not involved.

### 3. Spectral Imaging

- **Infrared Signature**: Rule Out “Firebloom”
- **Ultraviolet Signature**: Rule Out “Moonshade”
- **Visible Spectrum Only**: No known exclusions

Spectral imaging reveals hidden characteristics. Plants lacking an infrared signature, for example, exclude the presence of Firebloom.

### 4. pH Test

- **pH 0.0-4.0**: No known exclusions
- **pH 4.1-7.0**: Rule Out “Ironwood Bark”
- **pH 7.1-14.0**: No known exclusions

The acid-base balance of the mixture determines specific plant exclusions. A pH ranging from 4.1 to 7.0 rules out Ironwood Bark.

### 5. Luminescence Test

- **Bright Glow**: Rule Out “Moonshade”
- **Dim Glow**: No known exclusions
- **No Glow**: Rule Out “Firebloom,” “Moonshade”

Luminescence is measured in darkness, revealing the magical glow (or lack thereof) of plants. A bright glow points away from Moonshade.

### 6. Solubility Test

- **Solubility 0-20%**: No known exclusions
- **Solubility 21-80%**: Rule Out “Ironwood Bark”
- **Solubility 81-100%**: Rule Out “Goblin's Cap”

Test the plant's solubility in water; results help to exclude potential candidates. High solubility indicates that Goblin's Cap may not be part of the mixture.

## Concluding the Craft

By systematically applying these tests, you can confidently determine which plants should **not** be part of your healing elixir. This exclusion method helps refine your selection, allowing the true essence of your desired elixir to emerge. Continue your exploration with precision and curiosity, and may your elixirs bring healing and light to all who seek them.
