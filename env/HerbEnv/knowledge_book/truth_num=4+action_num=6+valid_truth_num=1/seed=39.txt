## Herb Testing and Brewing Experiments
To decipher the potential of these mystical plants, several tests are conducted. Each test has specific outcomes that help rule out certain plants, guiding you on your path to creating potent elixirs.

### 1. Luminescence Test
This experiment examines the ability of plants to emit light in the dark.

- **Bright Glow**: If observed, eliminate Lunalily, as it is known for its strong luminescence.
- **Dim Glow**: No plants are ruled out; all remain possibilities.
- **No Glow**: Eliminate Nightglow, as it is expected to exhibit some luminescence due to its namesake.

### 2. Aroma Analysis
This test identifies the scent profile of the plants.

- **Red Flames**: Similarly, no plants are eliminated.

### 4. pH Test
This test determines the acidity or basicity of plant extracts.

- **pH 0.0 to 4.0**: Bloodroot is the exception in this acidic range and should be eliminated.
- **pH 4.1 to 7.0**: All plants are still considered valid.
- **pH 7.1 to 14.0**: All continue to remain usable options.

### 5. Solubility Test
Examines how well plant extracts dissolve in various solvents.
