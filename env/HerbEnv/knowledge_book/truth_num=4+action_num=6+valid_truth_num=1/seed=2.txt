# The Healing Elixir Creation Guidebook

In the world of mystical healing, the creation of potent elixirs relies on the careful selection and combination of magical herbs. This guidebook introduces you to the awe-inspiring plants—Cinderweed, Embergrass, Elfroot, and Frostberry—and the intricate experiments used to discern their properties and potential. Our goal is to assist alchemists in correctly identifying the herbs best suited for healing elixirs by eliminating unsuitable candidates through a series of tests.

## Mystical Plants Overview

### Cinderweed
A fiery plant known for its intense energy, Cinderweed has distinct qualities that can either invigorate or overwhelm an elixir. Its volatile nature means it often reacts strongly in alchemical processes.

### Embergrass
With a warm presence, Embergrass is sought after for its ability to sustain warmth and light, making it invaluable for restorative elixirs that rejuvenate.

### Elfroot
This is a versatile herb often used for its mild and agreeable nature. Elfroot is favored in concoctions that require stability and subtlety.

### Frostberry
These berries are known for their cooling essence. They can temper fiery elixirs, bringing balance and calm.

## Herb Testing and Brewing Experiments

Through systematic experimentation, alchemists can discern the unique properties of each plant by observing specific reactions or characteristics. Below are detailed descriptions of each test and the rules for ruling out mystical plants.

### Solubility Test
This test measures how much of the herb can dissolve in a solution, ranging from 0 to 100.

- **21-80 Solubility**: Rule Out **Cinderweed**  
  If the herb dissolves in this range, it indicates properties unsuitable for Cinderweed, which has a distinct solubility range.

### Color Change Test
This test examines the color transformation when herbs are submerged in a reactive medium.

- **Turns Red**: Rule Out **Frostberry**  
  If a red color appears, it suggests the characteristics unlike those of Frostberry.

### Spectral Imaging
This technique captures the light signature emitted by herbs, revealing their spectral properties.

- **Infrared Signature**: Rule Out **Embergrass**  
  Infrared emissions indicate features inconsistent with Embergrass, known for its visible light properties.

### Alchemical Reagent Test
Through this test, herbs are exposed to reactive solutions to observe their response.

- **Reacts Violently**: Rule Out **Cinderweed**  
  A violent reaction highlights the absence of characteristics inherent to Cinderweed.
- **Reacts Mildly**: Rule Out **Elfroot**  
  Mild reactions suggest a deviation from the gentler nature of Elfroot.

### Luminescence Test
This test checks for light emission when a plant is energized, ranging from no glow to bright glow.

- **No Glow**: No specific plants ruled out  
  Some properties observed are common in multiple plants; hence, no eliminations are determined solely by a lack of luminescence.

### Etheric Vibration Test
The etheric vibration detects subtle energy levels of herbs within various frequency ranges.

- **No specific vibration range for plant elimination**  
  Currently, there are no defined ranges that uniquely rule out any of the mystical plants based on etheric vibrations alone.

## Conclusion

Each of these experiments serves as a guide to precisely rule out unsuitable mystical plants for your healing elixir. By carefully following the outcomes and eliminating the improbable candidates, you can confidently select the right combination of herbs to create powerful and effective elixirs. In the realm of healing alchemy, precision and knowledge are your most powerful tools.
