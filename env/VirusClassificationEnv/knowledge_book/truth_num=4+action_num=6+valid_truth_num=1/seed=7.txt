## Guidebook for Viral Biological Classification and Experimental Analysis

This guidebook aims to provide an overview of the biological classifications of certain viral families and to outline experimental analyses used to understand their characteristics. The following families will be discussed: Nodaviridae, Birnaviridae, Tombusviridae, and Bornaviridae. Experimental tests are then used to differentiate and classify these viral families by ruling out certain classifications based on test outcomes.

### Viral Classifications

1. **Nodaviridae**
   - Typically infect animal hosts including humans.
   - Known to have enveloped viruses.
   - Possess a non-segmented genome.
   - Exhibit a low to moderate G+C content in their genome.

2. **Birnaviridae**
   - Known to infect both human and animal hosts.
   - These viruses are enveloped.
   - They carry a non-segmented genome.
   - Display a high G+C content in their genomic sequences.

3. **Tombusviridae**
   - Primarily identified in plant hosts.
   - They are enveloped viruses.
   - Characterized by having a segmented genome.
   - Genome can range from low to high G+C content.

4. **Bornaviridae**
   - Known for infecting both human and animal hosts.
   - These viruses are non-enveloped.
   - They possess a segmented genome.
   - Have a G+C content ranging from low to high.
   - Unique in their nuclear site of replication.

### Experiments and Result-Based Exclusions

The following experiments are used to differentiate these viral families by ruling out certain classifications when specific outcomes are observed:

1. **Host Range Determination**
   - **Outcome:** If only plant hosts are observed, consider excluding Nodaviridae, Birnaviridae, and Bornaviridae.
   - **Outcome:** If fungal hosts come into question, they rule out all current classifications due to no observed fungal hosts.

2. **Enveloped vs Non-enveloped Determination**
   - **Outcome:** If a virus is identified as non-enveloped, then exclude Nodaviridae, Tombusviridae, and Birnaviridae.
   - **Outcome:** An enveloped outcome rules out Bornaviridae.

3. **Genome Segmentation Analysis**
   - **Outcome:** A non-segmented genome excludes Birnaviridae and Nodaviridae.
   - **Outcome:** If segmented genomes are observed, rule out Tombusviridae and Bornaviridae.

4. **Replication Site Analysis**
   - **Outcome:** If nuclear replication is observed, exclude Bornaviridae.
   - **Outcome:** If cytoplasmic replication is observed, exclude Birnaviridae.

5. **Envelope Presence Test**
   - **Outcome:** Absence of an envelope rules out Nodaviridae, Tombusviridae, and Birnaviridae.
   - **Outcome:** Envelope presence rules out Bornaviridae again confirming results of 'Enveloped vs Non-enveloped Determination.'

6. **G+C Content of Genome Determination**
   - **Outcome:** Low (0-40%) G+C content excludes Tombusviridae, Bornaviridae, and Nodaviridae.
   - **Outcome:** If mid-range (40-60%) is observed, no clear exclusions can be made based on current data.
   - **Outcome:** High (60-100%) G+C content excludes Birnaviridae, Tombusviridae, Bornaviridae, and Nodaviridae.

### Summary

This guidebook illustrates the diagnostic process by illustrating certain experimental outcomes that lead to the exclusion of possible viral classifications. Each experiment is a step in narrowing down potential classifications and understanding the virus's biological properties. Always consider each exclusion as part of a larger picture in viral identification and classification.
