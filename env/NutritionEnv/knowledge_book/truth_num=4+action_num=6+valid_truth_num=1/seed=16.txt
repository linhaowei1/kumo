# Nutritional Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Nutritional Analysis Guidebook, a comprehensive resource for understanding specific dietary regimens and health evaluations. This guidebook aims to help you navigate dietary decisions based on personalized health evaluations. Through understanding the nuances of each dietary regimen and learning how health evaluations inform dietary exclusions, you will be empowered to make more informed nutritional choices.

## Dietary Regimens

1. **Carnivore Diet**: This diet primarily consists of animal products like meat, fish, and animal-derived products, excluding all plant-based foods. It is characterized by its high protein and fat content but lacks carbohydrates.

2. **Calorie Restriction Diet**: This dietary approach involves reducing daily caloric intake without malnutrition or deprivation of essential nutrients. It is often pursued for weight loss or to improve health markers.

3. **Ketogenic Diet**: A high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet designed to induce ketosis, a metabolic state where the body burns fat for fuel. It is known for promoting weight loss and supporting neurological health.

4. **Low-FODMAP Diet**: This diet is aimed at reducing the intake of certain short-chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine, often recommended for individuals experiencing digestive issues like IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome).

## Health Evaluations and Dietary Exclusions

- **Sensitive to Nightshades**: All dietary regimens can be considered because the outcomes do not rule out any specific diets.
- **No Sensitivities**: All dietary regimens can be considered, as no exclusions are necessary.

### Omega-3 Index Test
- **Omega-3 levels between 0 and 4**: The Carnivore Diet should be excluded.

- **Markers between 3.1 and 10.0**: No specific dietary regimens are recommended for exclusion.

### Vitamin D Level Test

- **Vitamin D levels between 0 and 19**: The Carnivore Diet and Ketogenic Diet should be excluded.
- **Vitamin D levels between 51 and 100**: No specific dietary regimens are recommended for exclusion.

### Allergic Reaction Test
- **Positive for Gluten**: The Carnivore Diet, Calorie Restriction Diet, and Ketogenic Diet should be considered, but exclude the Low-FODMAP Diet.
- **Positive for Dairy**: All dietary regimens can be considered as no exclusions are necessary.
- **Negative**: All dietary regimens can be considered as no exclusions are necessary.
