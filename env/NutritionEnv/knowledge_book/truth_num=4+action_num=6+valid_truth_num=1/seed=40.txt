## Nutritional Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Nutritional Analysis Guidebook designed to help you understand various dietary regimens and health evaluations. This guide provides insights into when certain diets may not be suitable based on specific health assessment outcomes. This is not a recommendation for any specific diet but rather an elimination approach to help you consider alternatives when certain health conditions are observed.

### Dietary Regimens

Here's a brief overview of the dietary regimens included:

1. **Jenny Craig Diet**: A structured weight-loss plan focusing on pre-packaged meals and personal coaching to help with portion control and balanced nutrition.

2. **High-Fruit Diet**: Emphasizes a high intake of fruits which are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, aiming to improve overall health and lower risk of chronic diseases.

3. **South Beach Diet**: A popular low-carb diet that focuses on reducing cravings and encouraging healthy eating habits with an emphasis on high protein and healthy fats.

4. **Low-Sodium Diet**: Targets the reduction of salt intake to help manage blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

### Health Evaluations

These evaluations help determine which dietary regimens might need to be ruled out based on specific health outcomes:

1. **Blood Pressure Check**: Measures the force of blood against your artery walls. Ideal levels range between 90/60 mm Hg and 119/79 mm Hg.

2. **BMI Measurement**: Assesses body fat based on height and weight. A healthy BMI ranges from 18.5 to 24.9.

3. **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test**: Tests the body’s ability to process glucose. Normal glucose levels fall between 70 to 139 mg/dL.

4. **Thyroid Function Test**: Evaluates how well the thyroid is working. Normal TSH levels are between 0.4 and 4.0 mIU/L.

5. **HbA1c Test**: Measures average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months. A normal HbA1c level is below 5.7%.

6. **Blood Sugar Test**: A direct measure of the blood glucose level at the time of the test. Normal ranges are 70 to 99 mg/dL.
