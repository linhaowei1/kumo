# Nutritional Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of four dietary regimens and six health evaluations, focusing on their relationships and how specific test outcomes may influence dietary decisions. This guide aims to help individuals and healthcare professionals understand which diets might need to be excluded based on various health evaluation results.

## Dietary Regimens

### 1. Ketogenic Diet
The ketogenic diet is characterized by a high fat, very low carbohydrate, and moderate protein intake. It aims to induce ketosis, a metabolic state where the body burns stored fats instead of carbohydrates for energy.

### 2. DASH Diet
The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet emphasizes a reduction in sodium intake and an increase in foods rich in potassium, calcium, and magnesium. It promotes heart health by encouraging the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.

### 3. Raw Food Diet
This diet consists primarily of uncooked and unprocessed foods, aiming to preserve nutritional value. It includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and some sprouted grains and legumes.

### 4. Elimination Diet
An elimination diet involves removing specific foods or ingredients from the diet to identify any food sensitivities or allergies. After a period of elimination, foods are gradually reintroduced to monitor any reactions.

## Health Evaluations and Dietary Exclusions

Each health evaluation measures different aspects of bodily function, which can inform dietary choices by ruling out certain dietary regimens when specific test outcomes are observed.

### 1. Blood Sugar Test
This test measures the concentration of glucose in your blood. Depending on the results, specific dietary regimens may be excluded.

- **70-99 mg/dL**: Rule out the Raw Food Diet.
- **100-125 mg/dL**: No dietary regimens are ruled out.
- **126-200 mg/dL**: Rule out the Ketogenic Diet.

### 2. Cortisol Level Test
Cortisol is a hormone released in response to stress. Abnormal levels can indicate health issues that may require dietary adjustments.

- **5-25 mcg/dL**: Rule out the DASH Diet.
- **25.1-50 mcg/dL**: No dietary regimens are ruled out.
- **50.1-100 mcg/dL**: Rule out the Ketogenic Diet.

### 3. Homocysteine Level Test
Homocysteine is an amino acid in the blood that, at high levels, can increase the risk of heart disease.

- **5.0-15.0 μmol/L**: Rule out the DASH Diet.
- **15.1-30.0 μmol/L**: No dietary regimens are ruled out.
- **30.1-100.0 μmol/L**: Rule out the Ketogenic Diet.

### 4. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test
This test assesses how well your body processes sugar over time, providing insight into glucose metabolism.

- **70-139 mg/dL**: No dietary regimens are ruled out.
- **140-199 mg/dL**: No dietary regimens are ruled out.
- **200-300 mg/dL**: Rule out the Ketogenic Diet.

### 5. Electrolyte Panel
This test measures key electrolytes in the blood, essential for maintaining bodily functions.

- **Normal**: Rule out the DASH Diet.
- **Hyponatremia**: No dietary regimens are ruled out.
- **Hyperkalemia**: Rule out the Ketogenic Diet.

### 6. Thyroid Function Test
This evaluation measures the output of thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism.

- **0.4-4.0 mIU/L**: Rule out the DASH Diet.
- **4.1-10.0 mIU/L**: Rule out the Raw Food Diet.
- **10.1-100.0 mIU/L**: No dietary regimens are ruled out.

In conclusion, this guidebook helps decipher the relationship between health evaluations and dietary regimens to facilitate informed dietary adjustments. Each test provides critical insights that help rule out specific diets based on individual health needs. Always consult with healthcare professionals to make personalized nutritional decisions based on health evaluations.
