# Nutritional Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to offer insights into various dietary regimens and health evaluations. It will help you understand how specific dietary choices can be tailored based on health test outcomes, focusing on which diets to rule out based on the observed results.

## Dietary Regimens

### Vegetarian Diet
A Vegetarian Diet excludes meat and may include dairy, eggs, and other non-meat animal products. It is often chosen for ethical, environmental, or health reasons, and emphasizes the consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and grains.

### Gluten-Free Diet
A Gluten-Free Diet eliminates all forms of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is essential for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that their dietary intake avoids gluten to prevent adverse reactions.

### Ketogenic Diet
The Ketogenic Diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan that aims to induce ketosis, a metabolic state where the body burns fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. It is often used for weight loss and to manage certain medical conditions.

### DASH Diet
The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet is aimed at preventing and controlling hypertension. It emphasizes whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy, focusing on reducing sodium intake and promoting heart health.
