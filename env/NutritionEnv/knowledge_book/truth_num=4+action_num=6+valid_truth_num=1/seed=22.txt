# Nutritional Analysis Guidebook

Welcome to the Nutritional Analysis Guidebook, designed to help you make informed decisions about dietary regimens based on health evaluations. This guide provides a clear understanding of certain dietary patterns and how health evaluations can influence their suitability for you. Remember, this guide uses an exclusionary approach, meaning it will indicate which dietary regimens should be ruled out based on specific test outcomes.

## Dietary Regimens Overview

1. **Low-Carb Diet**
   - Focuses on reducing the intake of carbohydrates, emphasizing protein and fat consumption. It's often chosen for weight loss and managing blood sugar levels.

2. **Low-Sodium Diet**
   - Aims to lower sodium intake, which may help in reducing blood pressure. It involves consuming fresh foods and minimizing processed foods often high in sodium.

3. **Raw Food Diet**
   - Involves eating unprocessed and uncooked foods. It's believed to promote better health and detoxification by keeping nutrients and enzymes intact.

4. **Paleo Diet**
   - Inspired by the eating habits of ancient humans, this diet emphasizes whole foods, lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and nuts, eliminating processed foods.

     - Normal: The Raw Food Diet is ruled out.
     - Osteopenia: No dietary regimen exclusions.
     - Osteoporosis: No dietary regimen exclusions.

6. **Liver Function Test**
   - Evaluates liver health by measuring proteins, enzymes, and bilirubin in the blood.
   - Interpretation:
     - Levels 7 - 56: The Raw Food Diet is ruled out.
     - Levels 57 - 120: No dietary regimen exclusions.
