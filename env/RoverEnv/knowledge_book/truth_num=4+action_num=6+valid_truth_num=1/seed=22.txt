# Rover Identification Guidebook

Welcome to the Rover Identification Guidebook, an essential tool designed to help you identify and rule out rover prototypes based on specific test results and sensor calibration checks. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the rover prototypes and their corresponding tests. Understanding these results will allow you to precisely determine which rover prototypes do not meet certain criteria based on their performance during field tests.

## Rover Prototypes

1. **Rover SubTerrain**
2. **Rover Tesla**
3. **Rover EcoRover**
4. **Rover Stabilizer**

Each of these rover prototypes has been rigorously evaluated through a series of field tests and sensor calibration checks. Below we detail the specific tests conducted and the implications of their results in terms of ruling out certain rover prototypes.

## Field Tests and Sensor Calibration Checks

### 1. Planetary Protection Protocol Check

This test ensures that rovers adhere to planetary protection standards, preventing contamination of other planets.

- **Outdated**: The Rover EcoRover is ruled out if the "Outdated" state is observed.

### 2. Vibration Resistance Test

This test assesses the rover's ability to withstand vibrations, which is crucial in maintaining operational integrity on uneven terrain.

- **Poor**: The Rover Stabilizer is ruled out if the "Poor" state is observed.

### 3. Ground Penetrating Radar Calibration

This test checks the accuracy of radar systems that penetrate the ground to help navigate and identify underground obstacles.

- **Calibration Level (0, 0.5)**: If a result within this range is observed, the Rover SubTerrain is ruled out.

### 4. Obstacle Avoidance Test

This test evaluates the rover's capability to detect and maneuver around obstacles in its path.

- **Performance Range (80, 100)**: If a performance score within this range is recorded, the Rover Tesla is ruled out.

### 5. Lidar Calibration Test

This test determines the accuracy of Lidar sensors, crucial for mapping the terrain and enabling autonomous navigation.

- **Calibration Accurate**: When this result is observed, the Rover Tesla is ruled out.

### 6. Sensor Calibration

This overall sensor calibration check ensures that all sensors are functioning accurately for data collection.

- **Calibration Accurate**: When this result is observed, the Rover Tesla is ruled out.

## Conclusion

Through the results of these tests, precise rulings can be made on which rover prototypes are unsuitable for specific conditions or standards. This guide is structured to ensure straightforward deduction: whenever a specific result is observed during testing, the listed rover prototypes are excluded from consideration, thus streamlining the evaluation process. By eliminating these options, you have clearer insight into which rovers potentially meet the required specifications for deployment.

This comprehensive assessment serves as a reliable resource for understanding the compatibility and functionality of different rover prototypes, aiding in the effective selection and deployment of these sophisticated machines.
