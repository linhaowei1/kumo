## Rover Identification Guidebook

Welcome to the Rover Identification Guidebook, which presents an overview of several rover prototypes along with the field tests conducted to determine their functionalities and characteristics. The objective of this guidebook is to facilitate the process of identifying rover prototypes based on specific test outcomes. This guide employs a method where certain rovers are confirmed based on the results of individual sensor calibration checks and field tests, thereby ruling out others. Here, we introduce the rover prototypes, detail the tests conducted, and describe the implications of test results for rover identification.

## Rover Prototypes

1. **Rover RockScan**
   - A rover prototype focused on geological exploration, with specialized instruments designed for rock analysis.

2. **Rover SunShield**
   - Designed to function in environments with high UV exposure, featuring advanced ultraviolet shielding and detection capabilities.

3. **Rover Meteor**
   - Engineered for robust navigation and environmental mapping, with a strong emphasis on lidar and gyroscopic stability.

4. **Rover ChemPro**
   - Equipped for chemical analysis, this rover specializes in detecting and analyzing chemical compositions in various terrains.

## Field Tests and Sensor Calibration Checks

To accurately assess the capabilities of each rover prototype, a series of tests and calibrations are performed. Each result from these tests helps confirm certain rover prototypes, thereby ruling out others.

### 1. Rock Analysis Instrument Calibration
   - Measures the accuracy and calibration of instruments meant for rock analysis. 

   **Test Results:**
   - **(0, 0.5):** Indicates that **Rover RockScan** is the likely prototype, thereby ruling out **Rover SunShield**, **Rover Meteor**, and **Rover ChemPro**.

### 2. Chemical Analysis Module Test
   - Evaluates the functionality and accuracy of chemical analysis equipment.

   **Test Results:**
   - **Faulty:** Confirms that the rover is **Rover ChemPro**, ruling out **Rover RockScan**, **Rover SunShield**, and **Rover Meteor**.
   - **Functional** or **Highly Accurate:** Does not confirm any specific rover, allowing all rovers to remain as possibilities.

### 3. Ultraviolet Sensor Test
   - Tests the functionality and sensitivity of ultraviolet sensors on the rover.

   **Test Results:**
   - **Nonfunctional:** Confirms that the rover is **Rover SunShield**, ruling out **Rover RockScan**, **Rover Meteor**, and **Rover ChemPro**.
   - **Functional** or **Highly Sensitive:** Does not confirm any specific rover, allowing all rovers to remain as possibilities.

### 4. Lidar Calibration Test
   - Assesses the calibration accuracy of lidar systems used in navigation and mapping.

   **Test Results:**
   - **Calibration Needed:** Confirms that the rover is **Rover Meteor**, ruling out **Rover RockScan**, **Rover SunShield**, and **Rover ChemPro**.
   - **Calibration Accurate:** Does not confirm any specific rover, allowing all rovers to remain as possibilities.

### 5. Gyroscope Calibration Test
   - Checks whether the gyroscopic instruments, critical for stable navigation, are properly calibrated.

   **Test Results:**
   - **Calibration Needed:** Confirms that the rover is **Rover Meteor**, ruling out **Rover RockScan**, **Rover SunShield**, and **Rover ChemPro**.
   - **Calibration Accurate:** Does not confirm any specific rover, allowing all rovers to remain as possibilities.

### 6. Autonomous Navigation Test
   - Evaluates the rover's ability to navigate autonomously without errors.

   **Test Results:**
   - **Navigation Error:** Confirms that the rover is **Rover Meteor**, ruling out **Rover RockScan**, **Rover SunShield**, and **Rover ChemPro**.
   - **Navigation Successful:** Does not confirm any specific rover, allowing all rovers to remain as possibilities.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides clear rules for each field test and sensor calibration check, delineating which rover prototypes are confirmed based on specific test results, thereby ruling out others. By understanding and applying these confirmation and exclusion criteria, you can efficiently identify and differentiate between the rover prototypes for any given situation. Remember, the identification process is key: each test or calibration result serves to confirm certain prototypes and exclude others, thereby narrowing down the possibilities until the appropriate rover is identified.
