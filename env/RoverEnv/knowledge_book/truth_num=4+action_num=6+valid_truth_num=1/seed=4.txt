# Rover Identification Guidebook

Welcome to the Rover Identification Guidebook, designed to provide clear and straightforward information about rover prototypes and the field tests they undergo. This guidebook will help you understand how different test results can be used to rule out certain rover prototypes, aiding in the process of rover identification.

## Rover Prototypes

This guidebook focuses on the following rover prototypes, each designed with unique capabilities and distinct functionalities:

1. **Rover Cassini**
2. **Rover Neptune**
3. **Rover Apollo**
4. **Rover Frontier**

## Field Tests / Sensor Calibration Checks

Each rover undergoes a series of field tests and sensor calibration checks. The main goal of these tests is to evaluate the performance of the rover prototypes and to identify which prototypes can be ruled out based on their test results. Below are the tests performed:

1. **Software Diagnostics Check**
2. **Lidar Calibration Test**
3. **Atmospheric Analysis Test**
4. **Data Processing Speed Test**
5. **Communication Range Test**
6. **Soil Sampling Mechanism Test**

## Test Results and Rule-Out Criteria

The results from each test provide crucial information that helps in ruling out specific rover prototypes. The criteria for exclusion are explained as follows:

### 1. Software Diagnostics Check
- **Errors Detected**: If errors are detected during this check, the following rover is ruled out:
  - Rover Neptune

### 2. Lidar Calibration Test
- **Calibration Needed**: If the test indicates calibration is needed, the following rover is ruled out:
  - Rover Apollo

### 3. Atmospheric Analysis Test
- **Analysis Complete**: If atmospheric analysis is complete, the following rover can be ruled out:
  - Rover Cassini

### 4. Data Processing Speed Test
- **Processing Speed (0-500)**: If the processing speed falls within 0 to 500, the following rover is ruled out:
  - Rover Neptune

### 5. Communication Range Test
- **Range (0-500)**: If the communication range is between 0 to 500, the following rover is ruled out:
  - Rover Neptune

### 6. Soil Sampling Mechanism Test
- **Mechanism Operational**: If the soil sampling mechanism is operational, the following rover can be ruled out:
  - Rover Apollo

## Conclusion

By understanding the outcomes of these tests, you can effectively eliminate certain rover prototypes based on their respective test results. This helps streamline the identification process, ensuring that only viable rover prototypes are considered for operational use.

Please utilize this guidebook as a reference to accurately assess and conclude which rover prototypes are unsuitable based on the known test results.
