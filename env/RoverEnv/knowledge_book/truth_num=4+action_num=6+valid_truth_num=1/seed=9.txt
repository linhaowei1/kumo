# Rover Identification Guidebook

Welcome to the Rover Identification Guidebook. This guide is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the various rover prototypes currently tested, alongside the specific field tests and sensor calibration checks performed on them. In interpreting these tests, the guide uses a systematic approach to rule out certain rover prototypes based on the results obtained. This method ensures clear and straightforward identification of rover prototypes relevant to specific test outcomes.

## Rover Prototypes

1. **Rover HydroScan**
   - A prototype designed to detect hydrogen presence effectively in various environments.
   
2. **Rover Titan**
   - Known for its robust structure and capability to operate in extreme conditions.

3. **Rover Neptune II**
   - An advanced model equipped with numerous sensors for space exploration and environmental study.

4. **Rover SubTerrain**
   - Specializes in underground exploration, fitted with state-of-the-art radar systems for subsurface mapping.

## Field Tests and Sensor Calibration Checks

### Sensor Calibration

- **Purpose**: To ensure the accurate functioning of all sensors installed on the rover.
- **Exclusion Rule**: If calibration is needed, Rover Neptune II must be ruled out.

### Hydrogen Detector Calibration

- **Purpose**: To fine-tune the hydrogen detection capabilities to the highest sensitivity possible.
- **Exclusion Rule**: If calibration is needed, Rover HydroScan should be excluded.

### Ground Penetrating Radar Calibration

- **Purpose**: To calibrate the radar system to the optimal range for underground scanning.
- **Exclusion Rule**:
  - For calibration sensitivity range (0, 0.5): Rover SubTerrain is ruled out.

### Environmental Sensor Test

- **Purpose**: To ascertain the functionality of environmental sensors critical for data collection.
- **Exclusion Rule**: If the sensors are malfunctioning, Rover Neptune II is ruled out.

### Instrument Calibration Test

- **Purpose**: Ensures all instruments are functioning properly and are well-calibrated for precise operations.
- **Exclusion Rule**: If instruments are out of calibration, Rover Neptune II should be excluded.

### Communication Range Test

- **Purpose**: To test the rover's communication capabilities over varying distances.
- **Exclusion Rule**:
  - For communication range (0, 500): Rover Neptune II is eliminated as a possibility.

## Conclusion

By systematically applying these exclusion rules when interpreting field test results, each test helps in narrowing down the list of possible rover prototypes. This guide ensures that only those rovers meeting all the necessary calibration and functionality standards are considered suitable for specific tasks or environments. Understanding these relationships allows researchers and engineers to optimize rover selection for specific missions.
