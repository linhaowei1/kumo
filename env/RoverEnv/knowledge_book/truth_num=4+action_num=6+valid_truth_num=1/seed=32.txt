# Rover Identification Guidebook

This guidebook serves as a comprehensive manual to introduce and explain the characteristics and test results associated with various rover prototypes. Below, we break down each rover prototype and outline the field tests and sensor calibration checks conducted. For each test, we identify which rover prototypes must be excluded when certain test results are observed, aiding in the precise identification and assessment of each prototype's status.

## Rover Prototypes

1. **Rover SunShield**
2. **Rover Zenith II**
3. **Rover Galileo**
4. **Rover Neptune**

## Field Tests and Sensor Calibration Checks

### 1. Software Diagnostics Check
This critical test evaluates the software integrity and performance of each rover prototype.

- **Errors Detected**: If errors are detected during the software diagnostics check, **Rover Neptune** must be excluded from further consideration due to its identified software issues.

### 2. Gyroscope Calibration Test
This test assesses the accuracy of the navigation systems, which rely on the gyroscope for direction and stability.

- **Calibration Accurate**: If the gyroscope is accurately calibrated, **Rover Galileo** is excluded from being miscalibrated or malfunctioning, indicating it should not be considered for gyroscopic errors.

### 3. Ultraviolet Sensor Test
This test inspects the functionality of ultraviolet sensors, ensuring they operate correctly to protect and conduct assessments under solar exposure.

- **Nonfunctional**: If the ultraviolet sensor is found nonfunctional, **Rover SunShield** is ruled out due to its failure in this test.

### 4. Instrument Calibration Test
All scientific and operational instruments are calibrated and checked for their precision in this test.

- **Instruments Out of Calibration**: When instruments are out of calibration, **Rover Neptune** is eliminated from consideration for successful calibration, as its instruments failed this check.

### 5. Mobility Test
The mobility test checks the rover's capability to traverse difficult terrain, ensuring it can perform in various landscapes.

- **Passed**: If the mobility test is passed, **Rover Zenith II** is excluded from being considered for failed mobility, showing its positive performance in this aspect.

### 6. Environmental Sensor Test
This test evaluates the performance and accuracy of sensors measuring environmental variables â€“ critical for any scientific expeditions.

- **Sensors Malfunctioning**: Upon discovering malfunctioning sensors, **Rover Neptune** is removed from consideration, given its inability to reliably measure environmental conditions.

## Conclusion

In this guidebook, we provide an overview of the notable rover prototypes and elucidate the outcomes of several crucial tests. The exclusion criteria outlined are based on the performance of individual rovers in each test, offering a clear methodology for identifying and ruling out specific rover prototypes based on their test results. This systematic approach aims to guide rover selection and identification efforts, ensuring that only the best-suited prototypes are considered for missions requiring robust, reliable, and precise robotic rovers.
