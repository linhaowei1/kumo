# Rover Identification Guidebook

Welcome to the Rover Identification Guidebook, a comprehensive manual designed to aid in the distinction and analysis of various rover prototypes through a series of field tests and sensor calibration checks. This guide will expound on these rover prototypes and the tests employed to determine their capabilities, ensuring a fundamental understanding of the procedures and the elimination process based on test results. Below, we introduce the rovers and the tests applied.

## Rover Prototypes

1. **Rover Voyager**
2. **Rover Titan**
3. **Rover Sojourner**
4. **Rover Curiosity**

## Field Tests and Sensor Calibration Checks

1. **Accelerometer Calibration Test**  
   This test assesses the accuracy of the accelerometer within the rover's systems, providing insights into its calibration needs.

2. **Atmospheric Analysis Test**  
   This test evaluates the rover's ability to analyze atmospheric conditions accurately.

3. **Terrain Analysis Capability Test**  
   Measuring the rover's efficiency in analyzing rough terrain to determine its navigational capabilities.

4. **Navigation System Test**  
   This test determines the sophistication of the rover's navigation capabilities, ranging from basic to advanced or autonomous system levels.

5. **Data Processing Speed Test**  
   Evaluates how quickly the rover can process data, categorizing the speeds into different brackets.

6. **Lidar Calibration Test**  
   This test checks the accuracy of the Lidar system, which is crucial for precision in distance and environmental scanning.

## Results Analysis and Exclusion Guidelines

### 1. Accelerometer Calibration Test
- **Calibration Needed**: There are no specific exclusion details provided, indicating no current rover falls into this category.
- **Calibration Accurate**: When accurate calibration is observed, **Rover Curiosity** is ruled out.

### 2. Atmospheric Analysis Test
- **Analysis Incomplete**: When the analysis is incomplete, **Rover Voyager** is ruled out.
- **Analysis Complete**: When the analysis is complete, **Rover Curiosity** is ruled out.

### 3. Terrain Analysis Capability Test
- **(0, 50) Capability Range**: If the capability falls within this range, **Rover Sojourner** is ruled out.
- **(50, 100) Capability Range**: If the capability falls within this range, **Rover Curiosity** is ruled out.

### 4. Navigation System Test
- **Basic Navigation**: When only basic navigation is present, **Rover Curiosity** is ruled out.
- **Advanced Navigation**: No rovers are currently ruled out in the context of advanced navigation as none have been observed.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Similar to advanced navigation, no rovers are ruled out under this category.

### 5. Data Processing Speed Test
- **(0, 500) Speed Range**: At this speed range, no specific rover is ruled out.
- **(500, 1000) Speed Range**: If the data processing speed is within this range, **Rover Sojourner** and **Rover Voyager** are ruled out.
- **(1000, 2000) Speed Range**: At this speed range, **Rover Curiosity** is ruled out.

### 6. Lidar Calibration Test
- **Calibration Needed**: No specific rovers fall into this category, indicating all are currently excluded from needing calibration.
- **Calibration Accurate**: When Lidar calibration is accurate, **Rover Curiosity** is ruled out.

By understanding and applying these exclusion rules, one can effectively narrow down the identification and operational specifications of each rover prototype based on their test performance and calibration results. Use this guide to aid in ensuring precise rover identification in various field operations.
