# Rover Identification Guidebook

This guidebook aims to provide an understanding of how to identify and distinguish between various rover prototypes based on performance results from specific field tests and sensor calibration checks. By analyzing the outcomes of these assessments, we can determine which rover prototypes should be excluded from consideration under certain testing conditions.

## Rover Prototypes
The rovers being assessed in this guide include the following prototypes:
- **Rover Earth**
- **Rover Hercules III**
- **Rover Newton**
- **Rover Epsilon**

## Field Tests and Sensor Calibration Checks
The rover prototypes are subjected to several tests and calibrations to evaluate their operational capabilities and sensor accuracies:

1. **Obstacle Avoidance Test**
   - This test evaluates the rover's ability to navigate around obstacles.
   - **Rule-Out Results:**
     - Performance range (0-50): No rovers ruled out.
     - Performance range (50-80): No rovers ruled out.
     - Performance range (80-100): **Exclude Rover Newton.**

2. **Dust Filtration Test**
   - This test determines the effectiveness of the rover's dust filtration system.
   - **Rule-Out Results:**
     - Efficiency range (0-60): No rovers ruled out.
     - Efficiency range (60-80): No rovers ruled out.
     - Efficiency range (80-100): **Exclude Rover Epsilon.**

3. **Planetary Protection Protocol Check**
   - This check assesses the rover's adherence to planetary protection standards.
   - **Rule-Out Results:**
     - Status "Outdated": **Exclude Rover Earth.**
     - Status "Standard": No rovers ruled out.
     - Status "Advanced": No rovers ruled out.

4. **Battery Efficiency Test**
   - This test measures how efficiently the rover uses its battery power.
   - **Rule-Out Results:**
     - Efficiency range (0-60): **Exclude Rover Newton and Rover Hercules III.**
     - Efficiency range (60-80): No rovers ruled out.
     - Efficiency range (80-100): No rovers ruled out.

5. **Lidar Calibration Test**
   - This calibration ensures that the rover's lidar system is accurately tuned.
   - **Rule-Out Results:**
     - "Calibration Needed": No rovers ruled out.
     - "Calibration Accurate": **Exclude Rover Newton.**

6. **Accelerometer Calibration Test**
   - This calibration verifies the accuracy of the rover's accelerometer sensors.
   - **Rule-Out Results:**
     - "Calibration Needed": No rovers ruled out.
     - "Calibration Accurate": **Exclude Rover Newton.**

## Conclusion
By examining these test results, we effectively rule out specific rover prototypes under certain conditions. Utilizing this exclusion-based approach helps narrow down potential rover candidates based on their test and calibration performances. This guide serves as a comprehensive resource for distinguishing rover prototypes based on critical assessments.
