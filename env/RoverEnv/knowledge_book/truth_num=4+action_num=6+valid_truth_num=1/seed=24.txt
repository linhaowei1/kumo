## **Rover Identification Guidebook**

Welcome to the Rover Identification Guidebook, which aims to assist engineers and scientists in evaluating different rover prototypes through a series of field tests and sensor calibration checks. This guide delineates which rover prototypes are to be excluded based on test results, providing a clear framework for understanding rover performance characteristics.

## Rover Prototypes

This guide covers the following rover prototypes:

1. **Rover PressurePro**: Known for its focus on pressure sensor technology.
2. **Rover Dexter**: Equipped with a notably extendable robotic arm.
3. **Rover Zenith V**: Features advanced solar panels and radiation shielding.
4. **Rover Zenith II**: Demonstrates robust mobility capabilities.

## Field Tests and Sensor Calibration Checks

Each field test or sensor calibration check evaluates specific functionalities, providing insights into the performance of the rover prototypes. Below, each test is explained along with the rule-out conditions based on the observed states.

### 1. Mobility Test

- **Passed**: If a rover passes the mobility test, it is **identified as Rover Zenith II**, as passing this test confirms that the rover has robust mobility capabilities.

### 2. Solar Panel Efficiency Check

- **Efficiency 0-50%**: If observed, all rovers are included in potential candidates, so none can be excluded.
- **Efficiency 50-75%**: If observed, all rovers are included, and thus none are ruled out.
- **Efficiency 75-100%**: If efficiency in this range is observed, **Rover Zenith V is confirmed**, as its solar panels are designed to operate at high efficiency.

### 3. Pressure Sensor Calibration

- **Error Margin 0-0.5**: Observation in this range **confirms Rover PressurePro**, as it indicates high calibration accuracy specific to this prototype.
- **Error Margin 0.5-1.5**: All rovers are potential candidates with this result; none is excluded.
- **Error Margin 1.5-2.0**: This range does not exclude any rovers due to a moderate error margin.

### 4. Radiation Shielding Test

- **Insufficient Shielding**: If shielding is insufficient, **Rover Zenith V is excluded**, as it is known for its superior shielding capabilities.
- **Adequate Shielding**: If adequate shielding is observed, all rovers except Rover Zenith V remain potential candidates.

### 5. Robotic Arm Extension Test

- **Extension 0-30**: A test result within this range **confirms Rover Dexter**, which is known for its significant arm extension.
- **Extension 30-70**: Results in this extension range do not exclude any rover.
- **Extension 70-100**: If observed, no rover is excluded, indicating that high extension capability isn't expected.

### 6. Spectrometer Accuracy Test

- **Accuracy 0-70%**: No rovers are ruled out, indicating a base level of spectrometer accuracy.
- **Accuracy 70-90%**: Observations within this range do not exclude any rover.
- **Accuracy 90-100%**: This accuracy level includes all rovers, so none is excluded.

## Conclusion

The information above provides a systematic approach to identifying which rover prototypes are confirmed or ruled out based on test results. This guide is essential for ensuring targeted evaluations, allowing researchers and mission planners to make informed decisions about rover capabilities and limitations.
