# Rover Identification Guidebook

This guidebook aims to introduce and explain the identification and testing of various rover prototypes based on specific field tests and sensor calibration checks. The results of these tests are presented as exclusion criteria, meaning rovers that fail under specific conditions are ruled out. The rover prototypes covered in this guide include: **Rover RockScan**, **Rover Eclipse II**, **Rover Curiosity**, and **Rover Atlas III**.

## Rover Prototypes Overview

1. **Rover RockScan**: Known for its specialized rock analysis capabilities.
2. **Rover Eclipse II**: Features advanced terrain adaptability (details about specific tests involving this rover are not covered within this dataset).
3. **Rover Curiosity**: Equipped with superior diagnostic and sensor calibration tools.
4. **Rover Atlas III**: Designed for high-performance terrain analysis.

## Field Tests and Sensor Calibration Checks

The following tests are performed to evaluate the rovers' capabilities. Each test includes specific result states that determine which rovers are ruled out.

### 1. Terrain Analysis Capability Test
- **(0, 50):** All rovers are potential candidates as no exclusions are applicable.
- **(50, 100):** **Rover Atlas III** and **Rover Curiosity** are ruled out.

### 2. Rock Analysis Instrument Calibration
- **(0, 0.5):** **Rover RockScan** is ruled out.
- **(0.5, 1.0):** All rovers are potential candidates as no exclusions are applicable.
- **(1.0, 2.0):** All rovers are potential candidates as no exclusions are applicable.

### 3. Obstacle Avoidance Test
- **(0, 50):** All rovers are potential candidates as no exclusions are applicable.
- **(50, 80):** All rovers are potential candidates as no exclusions are applicable.
- **(80, 100):** **Rover Curiosity** is ruled out.

### 4. Software Diagnostics Check
- **Errors Detected:** All rovers are potential candidates as no exclusions are applicable.
- **No Errors:** **Rover Curiosity** is ruled out.

### 5. Antenna Alignment Test
- **Misaligned:** All rovers are potential candidates as no exclusions are applicable.
- **Properly Aligned:** **Rover Curiosity** is ruled out.

### 6. Arm Articulation Test
- **Articulation Limited:** All rovers are potential candidates as no exclusions are applicable.
- **Articulation Optimal:** **Rover Curiosity** is ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guidebook provides a clear framework for identifying rover prototypes based on specific field test results. By understanding which rovers are ruled out under various conditions, operators can make informed decisions about which rovers to utilize for specific tasks. All tests and results adhere strictly to exclusion-based criteria, ensuring clarity and precision in rover selection processes.
