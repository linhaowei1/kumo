# Rover Identification Guidebook

Welcome to the Rover Identification Guidebook—a comprehensive resource for understanding various rover prototypes and the field test results that help distinguish them. The information provided in this guide will assist you in ruling out certain rover prototypes from consideration based on field test results.

## Rover Prototypes Overview

1. **Rover Pioneer**: A versatile rover designed for exploration and communication tasks. It is equipped with advanced mobility features and a focus on photographic documentation.

2. **Rover Comet**: Known for its sensor systems, this rover prioritizes data accuracy and environmental interaction. It’s designed to retrieve and process information from surrounding terrains efficiently.

3. **Rover GeologyMax**: Specialized for scientific studies, particularly geological analysis. This rover is optimized for rock sampling and mineral identification.

4. **Rover Artemis**: A robust rover equipped for soil exploration and sample retrieval. It is built for durability and adaptability in varying environments.

## Field Tests and Sensor Calibration Checks

In determining the functionality and suitability of each rover, several tests and calibrations are performed:

1. **Sensor Calibration**: This test assesses the accuracy of the rover's sensors. 
   - **Rule-Out**: If calibration is needed, rule out "Rover Comet".

2. **Soil Sampling Mechanism Test**: Evaluates the rover's capacity to sample soil without jams.
   - **Rule-Out**: If the mechanism is operational, rule out "Rover Artemis".

3. **Rock Analysis Instrument Calibration**: Checks the precision of the instruments used for rock analysis.
   - **Rule-Out**: If calibration results are between (0, 0.5), rule out "Rover GeologyMax".

4. **Camera Resolution Test**: Determines the quality of imagery captured by the rover's cameras.
   - **Rule-Out**: If low resolution is observed, rule out "Rover Pioneer".

5. **Mobility Test**: Tests the rover's ability to navigate and maneuver in diverse terrains.
   - **Rule-Out**: If the test is passed, rule out "Rover Pioneer".

6. **Communication Range Test**: Assesses the effective communication range of the rover.
   - **Rule-Out**: If the range observed is between (500, 1000), rule out "Rover Pioneer".

## Conclusion

This guide outlines the specific test results and corresponding rover prototypes to be ruled out in response to each observed state. By following these exclusion rules, you can streamline the identification process and focus on selecting the right rover for the task at hand. Each eliminated possibility refines your selection and enhances decision-making accuracy.
