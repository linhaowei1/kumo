# Rover Identification Guidebook

Welcome to the Rover Identification Guidebook. This manual is designed to assist you in distinguishing between different rover prototypes based on their performance in various field tests and sensor calibration checks. The focus of this guide is on excluding or ruling out rover prototypes based on the observed results of specific tests. By understanding which rovers do not meet certain criteria, you can narrow down the potential candidates for further consideration in your projects.

## Rover Prototypes

The following rover prototypes are the subjects of our field tests and sensor calibration checks:

1. **Rover Sojourner**
2. **Rover Jupiter**
3. **Rover Zenith II**
4. **Rover Spirit**

## Field Tests / Sensor Calibration Checks

The rover prototypes were evaluated across six key tests. Each test provides insights that help rule out certain rover prototypes when specific results are observed.

### 1. Mobility Test

The Mobility Test assesses the ability of a rover to move effectively in various environments.

- **Failed**: 
  - Rule out **Rover Sojourner** and **Rover Spirit**.
- **Passed**:
  - Rule out **Rover Zenith II**.

### 2. Wheel Traction Test

This test measures the traction efficiency of rover wheels under different conditions, providing scores within predefined ranges.

- **Score 0-40**:
  - Rule out **Rover Spirit**.
- **Score 40-70**:
  - Rule out **Rover Sojourner**.
- **Score 70-100**:
  - No prototypes ruled out (no assigned rovers).

### 3. Terrain Adaptability Test

The Terrain Adaptability Test evaluates a rover's capability to navigate various terrains.

- **Low Adaptability**:
  - Rule out **Rover Jupiter**.
- **Medium Adaptability**:
  - No prototypes ruled out (no assigned rovers).
- **High Adaptability**:
  - No prototypes ruled out (no assigned rovers).

### 4. Data Processing Speed Test

This test gauges the data processing capabilities of the rovers, measured within specific speed ranges.

- **Speed 0-500**:
  - No prototypes ruled out (no assigned rovers).
- **Speed 500-1000**:
  - Rule out **Rover Sojourner**.
- **Speed 1000-2000**:
  - No prototypes ruled out (no assigned rovers).

### 5. Dust Protection Test

The Dust Protection Test assesses how well a rover can resist dust intrusion.

- **Poor Protection**:
  - Rule out **Rover Sojourner** and **Rover Spirit**.
- **Good Protection**:
  - No prototypes ruled out (no assigned rovers).

### 6. Thermal Stability Test

This test measures the thermal stability of the rovers under varying conditions.

- **Poor Stability**:
  - No prototypes ruled out (no assigned rovers).
- **Moderate Stability**:
  - Rule out **Rover Sojourner** and **Rover Spirit**.
- **High Stability**:
  - No prototypes ruled out (no assigned rovers).

Use this guide to systematically exclude rover prototypes based on the outcomes of each test. By ruling out ineligible candidates, you can focus your attention on the prototypes that best suit your technical and operational needs. Always refer to the specific results from these assessments to make informed decisions.
