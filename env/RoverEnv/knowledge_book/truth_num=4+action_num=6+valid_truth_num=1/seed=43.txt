## Rover Identification Guidebook

Welcome to the Rover Identification Guidebook, designed to help you understand the relationship between various rover prototypes and their respective test outcomes. Each section outlines the characteristics of individual rover prototypes and the results of specific field tests and sensor calibration checks. By interpreting these results, you can effectively determine which rover prototypes are excluded from consideration based on test performance.

## Rover Prototypes

### Rover Comet
Rover Comet is designed for diverse exploratory missions but faces challenges regarding navigation and sensor calibrations. The test results indicate that Rover Comet has experienced errors in autonomous navigation and requires calibration for both lidar sensors and general sensors.

### Rover Magellan
Rover Magellan focuses on accuracy and reliability, particularly in vision systems. However, if the Vision System Test outcome is **System Functional**, Rover Magellan is excluded from having functional vision systems.

### Rover Galileo
Rover Galileo prides itself on precise orientation and stability. However, if the Gyroscope Calibration Test outcome is **Calibration Accurate**, Rover Galileo is excluded from having calibration issues, ruling it out as a candidate with accurately calibrated gyroscopes.

### Rover HydroScan
Rover HydroScan specializes in detecting hydrogen in various environments. However, it requires further calibration for its hydrogen detection capabilities to enhance efficiency and eliminate unnecessary sensitivity.

## Field Tests and Sensor Calibration Checks

### Autonomous Navigation Test
This test assesses a rover's ability to navigate autonomously within a predefined environment:
- **Navigation Error**: Rover Comet showed navigation errors, excluding it from being considered successful in autonomous navigation.
- **Navigation Successful**: No rover prototypes are excluded based on a successful navigation outcome.

### Vision System Test
The Vision System Test evaluates the functionality of onboard vision systems:
- **System Faulty**: No rover prototypes are excluded based on a faulty vision system outcome.
- **System Functional**: Rover Magellan is excluded, ruling it out as having functional vision systems.

### Hydrogen Detector Calibration
This check ensures the hydrogen sensors are accurately calibrated and sensitive to appropriate thresholds:
- **Calibration Needed**: Rover HydroScan requires additional calibration, ruling it out as accurately calibrated in hydrogen detection.
- **Calibrated**: No rovers are excluded based on fully calibrated sensors.
- **Highly Sensitive**: There are no rovers excluded based on excessive sensitivity.

### Lidar Calibration Test
Lidar sensors are critical for spatial awareness and mapping:
- **Calibration Needed**: Rover Comet is ruled out here, as it requires calibration for its lidar system.
- **Calibration Accurate**: No rover prototypes are excluded based on accurately calibrated lidar.

### Sensor Calibration
This encompasses overall sensor checks to ensure consistent rover operations:
- **Calibration Needed**: Rover Comet again requires attention for calibration, ruling it out from being accurately calibrated in this test.
- **Calibration Accurate**: No rover is excluded based on overall sensor calibration accuracy.

### Gyroscope Calibration Test
Gyroscope systems are vital for maintaining the rover's orientation and balance:
- **Calibration Needed**: No rovers are excluded based on needing calibration.
- **Calibration Accurate**: Rover Galileo is excluded, ruling it out as having calibration issues.

In summary, this guide provides a comprehensive overview of the rover prototypes and verifies which may be ruled out from further consideration based on test results. Adjustments and calibrations are integral to advancing future missions and ensuring operational success.
