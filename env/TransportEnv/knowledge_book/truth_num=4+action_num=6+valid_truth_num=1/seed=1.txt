# Transportation Analysis Guidebook: An Exploration of Civilization's Transport Methods

## Introduction

Transportation has evolved dramatically throughout history and will continue to do so in the future. Understanding these transportation methods is essential to gain insight into civilizations' social, economic, and technological advancements. This guidebook explores the methods of transportation used by various civilizations, ranging from historical to futuristic perspectives, and examines how various artifact examination techniques can help rule out certain transportation methods based on observed outcomes.

## Transportation Methods

### Submarines

Submarines are aquatic vehicles capable of underwater travel. Historically, they have been used for military and exploration purposes. Submarines offer a unique mode of transport where routes are defined by their capability to navigate through marine environments.

### Automobiles

Automobiles are wheeled vehicles used primarily for ground transport. They have been the cornerstone of personal and public transportation in modern times, offering unparalleled mobility across terrains suited to road infrastructures.

### Walking

Walking, one of the most primitive forms of movement, is simple yet effective. It involves using human locomotion to travel across short distances or terrains that are otherwise inaccessible to vehicles.

### Gliders

Gliders are lightweight aircraft that are engineered to glide through the air without engine power, primarily using thermal currents to stay aloft. They represent a method of flight that relies on natural elements and aerodynamic design.

## Artifact Examination Techniques

Civilizations leave traces influenced by the methods of transportation they employ. By using specific artifact examination techniques, researchers can gather insights into the methods that were most likely used by that civilization.

### Structural Analysis of Pathways

This analysis inspects wear and alterations in pathways used by transportation methods:
- **Heavy Wear Detected**: Rules out Gliders and Submarines, suggesting that transportation methods such as Automobiles or Walking may have been used.
- **Minimal Wear Detected**: Excludes Automobiles, pointing towards the use of Gliders, Submarines, or other methods.
- **No Wear Detected**: Does not rule out any specific transportation methods, allowing for the possibility of Walking or methods that leave minimal to no structural impact.

### Energy Emission Detection

Measures the levels of energy emitted during transport operations:
- **(0.0, 1.0) Emission Levels**: Does not rule out any transport method based on emission levels within this range.
- **(1.0, 10.0) Emission Levels**: Excludes Walking and Gliders, indicating that methods like Submarines or Automobiles may not be responsible for this emission range.
- **(10.0, 100.0) Emission Levels**: Does not exclude any transport methods based on emission levels within this range.

### Route Pattern Mapping

Analyzes the spatial patterns formed by recurring paths of transport use:
- **Linear Routes Detected**: Excludes Gliders, suggesting that transportation methods such as Walking or Submarines may not follow linear routes.
- **Network of Paths Found**: Excludes Submarines, pointing towards the possibility of transportation methods like Walking or Gliders.
- **No Route Patterns**: Excludes Walking, indicating that structured transportation methods like Gliders or Submarines may have been used.

### Magnetic Field Detection

Monitors disruptions in geomagnetic fields caused by transportation technology:
- **(0.0, 0.5) Magnetic Field Levels**: Does not rule out any transportation methods within this range.
- **(0.5, 5.0) Magnetic Field Levels**: Excludes Walking, suggesting that more technologically advanced methods may be responsible for disruptions in this range.
- **(5.0, 100.0) Magnetic Field Levels**: Does not exclude any specific transport methods within this range.

### Biological Remains Analysis

Assesses biological materials left by transport users:
- **Non-human DNA Detected**: Excludes Walking, Automobiles, and Gliders, indicating that methods like Submarines or other non-biologically dependent transport methods may have been used.
- **Human DNA Detected**: Does not rule out any specific transport methods based on human DNA detection alone.
- **No Biological Remains**: Does not exclude any specific methods directly.

### Fossil Fuel Residue Analysis

Studies residue from fossil fuels used in machinery:
- **Significant Residues Found**: Does not rule out any specific transport methods based on residue findings.
- **No Residues Found**: Excludes Automobiles and Submarines, suggesting that transportation methods like Walking or Gliders may have been used.

## Closing Remarks

This guide facilitates understanding and analyzing transportation methods across different civilizations. By employing artifact examination techniques, we can discern the presence or absence of specific transport methods through a process of elimination, offering insights into the progress and characteristics of past and future societies.
