# Transportation Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive analysis of various transportation methods from historical and futuristic contexts. It outlines the transport methods, the processes used for artifact examination and route pattern mapping, and the associated outcomes based on observed states. The emphasis is on ruling out specific transport methods based on examination findings.

## Transport Methods

1. **Solar-powered Cars**: Vehicles that utilize solar panels to harness energy from the sun, converting it into electricity to power the car. They represent historical advancements toward sustainable transportation.

2. **Anti-gravity Vehicles**: Leveraging advanced technology to negate the force of gravity, these vehicles float or fly, representing a futuristic vision of transportation without traditional wheels or tracks.

3. **Skateboards**: Manually operated boards often used for recreation or short-distance urban commuting. They are simple, personal mode of transport with a long history.

4. **Subspace Corridors**: A theoretical mode of transport enabling instantaneous travel over long distances through alternate dimensions, reflecting futuristic and speculative science fiction concepts.

## Artifact Examination and Route Pattern Mapping Techniques

The techniques below are applied to discern various aspects of past transportation methods, typically seeking traces and residues that offer clues about the vehicles used.

### 1. Energy Emission Detection
Helps in identifying the type of transportation based on the level of energy emissions. 

**Outcome Rules**:
- Emission between 0.0 and 1.0 rules out **Anti-gravity Vehicles** and **Subspace Corridors**.
- Emission between 1.0 and 10.0 rules out **Skateboards**.
- Emission above 10.0 does not rule out any transport methods.

### 2. Biological Remains Analysis
Investigates the presence of biological residues related to different transport systems.

**Outcome Rules**:
- Detection of Non-human DNA rules out **Skateboards**.
- Human DNA presence does not rule out any transport method.
- Absence of biological remains rules out **Anti-gravity Vehicles** and **Subspace Corridors**.

### 3. Magnetic Field Detection
Assesses alterations in magnetic fields to deduce possible transportation technologies.

**Outcome Rules**:
- Magnetic field readings between 0.0 and 0.5 rule out **Anti-gravity Vehicles** and **Subspace Corridors**.
- Magnetic readings between 0.5 and 5.0 rule out **Skateboards**.
- Readings above 5.0 do not rule out any transport methods.

### 4. Electromagnetic Interference Detection
Measures levels of electromagnetic interference to determine eliminated transport types.

**Outcome Rules**:
- Interference below 0.1 rules out **Anti-gravity Vehicles** and **Subspace Corridors**.
- Interference between 0.1 and 1.0 rules out **Skateboards**.
- Interference ranging over 1.0 does not rule out any transport methods.

### 5. Chemical Residue Analysis
Examines chemical traces left by transportation methods to narrow down possibilities.

**Outcome Rules**:
- High fossil fuel residues rule out **Solar-powered Cars**, **Anti-gravity Vehicles**, and **Subspace Corridors**.
- Presence of biofuel residues rules out **Skateboards**.
- Absence of chemical residues does not rule out any transport methods.

### 6. Sonic Signature Analysis
Analyzes sound patterns and frequencies to identify exclusions of transport methods.

**Outcome Rules**:
- Sonic signatures between 0.0 and 20.0 rule out **Subspace Corridors**.
- Signatures between 20.0 and 70.0 rule out **Skateboards**.
- Signatures above 70.0 do not rule out any transport methods.

## Conclusion

This guidebook offers insight into deducing historical and futuristic transportation methods through a rule-out approach based on observed outcomes from various examination and detection techniques. Each method has distinct characteristics detectable by specific scientific analyses, helping researchers and historians exclude certain transportation possibilities based on their findings. This comprehensive analytical approach ensures a scientific and systematic exploration of transportation across civilizations.
