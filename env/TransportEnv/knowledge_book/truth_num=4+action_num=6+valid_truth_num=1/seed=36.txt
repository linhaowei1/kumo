# Transportation Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook explores various transportation methods of civilizations, both historical and futuristic, by utilizing different artifact examination techniques to determine plausible transport methods. This approach involves ruling out certain transport modes based on the outcomes of specific analyses. The transport methods under consideration include both primitive and advanced technologies—such as canoes and quantum teleportation devices—and this guide provides methodical insights into determining the likelihood of each method being utilized by examining historical residues and pattern mappings.

## Transport Methods

1. **Canoes**: These traditional watercraft were used extensively by early civilizations for travel and transport across waterways. Canoes date back thousands of years and are typically associated with minimal technological advancement.

2. **Helicopters**: These rotary-wing aircraft use powerful engines and rotor systems to achieve flight and have revolutionized modern air travel. Helicopters are critical for efficient transportation in areas with challenging terrain or limited infrastructure.

3. **Quantum Teleportation Devices**: A futuristic concept where objects or people are instantaneously transported from one location to another by leveraging quantum mechanics. This method is currently theoretical and would represent a significant leap forward in transport technology.

4. **Walking**: The most fundamental form of transportation, walking remains the primary mode of movement in various societies and is notable for its minimal environmental impact.

## Artifact Examination Techniques and Outcome Analysis

Each artifact examination method provides insights into past and potential transportation methods by identifying which methods can be excluded based on specific detected characteristics:

### 1. Energy Emission Detection
This technique involves measuring traces of energy emissions to determine the type of transportation methods used.

- **(0.0, 1.0) Energy Emission**: Rules out **Quantum Teleportation Devices**.
- **(1.0, 10.0) Energy Emission**: Rules out **Canoes** and **Walking**.
- **(10.0, 100.0) Energy Emission**: No exclusions applicable.

### 2. Fossil Fuel Residue Analysis
This analysis focuses on detecting fossil fuel residues to identify or exclude certain transport methods.

- **Significant Residues Found**: Rules out **Quantum Teleportation Devices**.

### 3. Magnetic Field Detection
This method involves detecting magnetic field disturbances caused by the transport methods.

- **(0.0, 0.5) Magnetic Field**: No exclusions applicable.
- **(0.5, 5.0) Magnetic Field**: Rules out **Canoes** and **Walking**.
- **(5.0, 100.0) Magnetic Field**: No exclusions applicable.

### 4. Sonic Signature Analysis
This analysis identifies sound signatures to deduce the type of transportation methods.

- **(0.0, 20.0) Sonic Signature**: No exclusions applicable.
- **(20.0, 70.0) Sonic Signature**: Rules out **Walking**.
- **(70.0, 140.0) Sonic Signature**: No exclusions applicable.

### 5. Biological Remains Analysis
This technique examines organic remnants to infer past transportation usage.

- **Non-human DNA Detected**: Rules out **Walking**.
- **Human DNA Detected**: Rules out **Canoes**.
- **No Biological Remains**: Rules out **Quantum Teleportation Devices**.

### 6. Route Pattern Mapping
This method identifies route patterns to determine which transportation methods can be excluded.

- **Linear Routes Detected**: Rules out **Quantum Teleportation Devices**.
- **Network of Paths Found**: Rules out **Helicopters**.
- **No Route Patterns**: Rules out **Canoes** and **Walking**.

## Summary

By analyzing the outcomes from various artifact examination techniques, researchers can systematically rule out transport methods that do not fit the observed data. This process, focusing on exclusion, allows for a more precise understanding of transportation methods utilized by past and possibly future civilizations.
