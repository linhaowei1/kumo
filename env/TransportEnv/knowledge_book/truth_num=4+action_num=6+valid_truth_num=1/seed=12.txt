## Transportation Analysis Guidebook: Exploring Transport Methods Across Civilizations

This guidebook provides insights into historical and futuristic transportation methods and offers a detailed examination of artifact-based route patterns to help discern which transport methods can be excluded based on various analytical outcomes. The methods of analysis include Artifact Examination, Structural Analysis, Fossil Fuel Analysis, Sonic Signature Analysis, Geological Layer Disruptions, and Biological Remains Analysis.

### Overview of Transport Methods

1. **Jet Airplanes**: These modern aircraft rely on powerful jet engines to travel at high altitudes and speeds, often spanning vast distances within short periods.

2. **Airships**: Lighter-than-air craft, such as blimps and zeppelins, utilize buoyant gases for lift, often used in scenarios requiring stable and sustained hover capabilities.

3. **Roller Skates**: A more personal and ground-based mode of transport that relies on wheel components and mechanical design, frequently associating with recreational or local utility.

4. **Flying Cars**: An envisioned advancement in urban transport, aiming to combine the convenience of automobiles with vertical takeoff and landing capabilities.
