### Transportation Analysis Guidebook: Exploring the Transport Methods of Civilizations

Welcome to the transportation analysis guidebook, a comprehensive exploration of historical and futuristic transport methods used by civilizations. This guidebook focuses on understanding these techniques by examining specific artifact examination and route pattern mapping methods. Each transport method discussed will be reviewed in the context of their exclusion based on analytical outcomes, ensuring a thorough understanding of their relevance or irrelevance to observed states.

#### Transport Methods Overview

1. **Walking on Water (Miraculous)**
   - A legendary and miraculous transportation method suggesting divine or supernatural intervention, allowing traversal over water surfaces without the use of traditional vessels.

2. **Canoes**
   - Small, lightweight vessels typically made from hollowed-out wood or bark, used for travel across water bodies, often associated with ancient and indigenous cultures.

3. **Gliders**
   - Airborne vehicles that are designed to glide through the air following launch from a height, capitalizing on wind currents and thermals for flight.

4. **Submarines**
   - Advanced underwater vessels capable of navigating below the water's surface, designed for both military and exploration purposes.

#### Artifact Examination and Route Pattern Mapping Methods

To understand ancient and potential futuristic transport methods, we utilize several analytical techniques. These methods help in ruling out specific transportation modes based on the evidence gathered during an artifact examination.

1. **Chemical Residue Analysis**
   - This involves identifying chemical traces left on artifacts, with specific attention to fossil fuel and biofuel residues.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - **High Fossil Fuel Residues:** (No exclusions)
     - **Biofuel Residues Found:** Canoes are ruled out.
     - **No Chemical Residues:** Walking on Water (Miraculous) is ruled out.

2. **Magnetic Field Detection**
   - An analysis of magnetic fields around sites and artifacts to determine past interactions or disruptions.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - **(0.0, 0.5):** (No exclusions)
     - **(0.5, 5.0):** Canoes are ruled out.
     - **(5.0, 100.0):** (No exclusions)

3. **Fossil Fuel Residue Analysis**
   - Examines residue remnants of fossil fuels to detect or exclude the use of ancient fuel-dependent transportation mechanisms.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - **Significant Residues Found:** (No exclusions)
     - **No Residues Found:** Submarines are ruled out.

4. **Geological Layer Disruptions**
   - Studies of ground layers for disruptions that may indicate previous routes or pathways of transportation.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - **Significant Disruptions Found:** (No exclusions)
     - **Minimal Disruptions Found:** Canoes and Gliders are ruled out.
     - **No Disruptions:** (No exclusions)

5. **Structural Analysis of Pathways**
   - Involves assessing the physical wear and tear or structural integrity along historical pathways.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - **Heavy Wear Detected:** Canoes, Gliders, and Submarines are ruled out.
     - **Minimal Wear Detected:** (No exclusions)
     - **No Wear Detected:** (No exclusions)

6. **Biological Remains Analysis**
   - The examination of biological traces, such as DNA fragments, helps identify the interaction or presence of human or non-human life.
   - **Outcomes:**
     - **Non-human DNA Detected:** Gliders are ruled out.
     - **Human DNA Detected:** Canoes are ruled out.
     - **No Biological Remains:** (No exclusions)

#### Conclusion

By meticulously employing these artifact examination and route pattern mapping methods, researchers can effectively rule out certain transportation methods based on observed outcomes. This exclusionary approach enhances our understanding of how civilizations traversed their environments, contributing valuable insights into the evolution, capabilities, and limitations of their transport solutions. This guidebook serves as a foundational resource for unraveling the mysteries of historical and futuristic transportation systems.
