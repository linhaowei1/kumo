# Art Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook provides an overview of selected artistic styles and a set of examinations used to analyze artworks, focusing on which styles can be ruled out based on specific examination outcomes. By understanding these rules, art enthusiasts and professionals can approach art analysis systematically.

### Artistic Styles

1. **Impressionism**: 
   - Characterized by thin, small visible brush strokes, open composition, and an emphasis on light and its changing qualities. Impressionists often used vibrant primary colors.

2. **Street Art**: 
   - Often found in public spaces, street art can include graffiti and murals. It typically displays fine craquelure patterns or, conversely, deep, wide cracks due to its exposure to outdoor elements.

3. **Impasto**: 
   - This involves the application of paint in thick layers, creating a texture that is observable in three dimensions. This technique is often used to give a painting a sense of depth.

4. **Fauvism**: 
   - Known for its wild brushwork and strident colors, Fauvism employs a monochromatic color scheme and emphasizes painterly qualities and strong color over the representational values.

### Examinations

These examinations aid art analysts in understanding the physical and chemical properties of paintings to identify which styles can be excluded based on certain findings:

1. **Color Palette Analysis**:
   - Examines the colors used in a piece to provide insights into potential artistic styles.
   - **Rule-out cases**:
     - *Dominant use of primary colors* excludes Impressionism.
     - *Monochromatic color scheme* excludes Fauvism.
     - High contrast complementary colors and earth tones do not specifically exclude any styles here.

2. **Crack Pattern Analysis**:
   - Studies the presence and type of cracking on a paintingâ€™s surface.
   - **Rule-out cases**:
     - *Fine craquelure pattern* and *Deep, wide cracks* each exclude Street Art.

3. **3D Surface Profilometry**:
   - Measures the topography of a painting surface, providing data on texture.
   - **Rule-out cases**:
     - Surface measurements in the range of (0.0, 0.2) exclude Impasto.

4. **Layer Thickness Measurement**:
   - Determines the thickness of the paint layers.
   - **Rule-out cases**:
     - A layer thickness of (0.0, 0.5) excludes Fauvism.

5. **Chiaroscuro Contrast Measurement**:
   - Analyzes the use of light and shadow to understand the contrast within a painting.
   - **Rule-out cases**:
     - Strong chiaroscuro contrast between (0.6, 1.0) excludes Fauvism and Impressionism.

6. **Chemical Solvent Reaction Test**:
   - Tests how the paint reacts to chemical solvents.
   - **Rule-out cases**:
     - No reaction to solvents excludes both Fauvism and Impressionism.

### Conclusion

This guide aims to provide a structured approach to art analysis by focusing on what can be excluded based on examination results. By systematically eliminating artistic styles through precise tests, one can narrow down the possibilities and approach a more accurate understanding of an artwork's origins and techniques.
