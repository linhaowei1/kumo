# Art Analysis Guidebook: Understanding Styles and Examinations

This guidebook is designed to help you navigate through various artistic styles and the methodologies used to analyze artworks. By understanding the characteristics of different art styles and the outcomes of examinations, you can effectively determine which styles are not represented in a particular artwork.

## Artistic Styles

### Precisionism
Precisionism is an American art movement that emerged in the early 20th century. It is characterized by clean lines, geometric forms, and a focus on industrialization and modernity. Artwork in this style often emphasizes the sharp structure and forms of buildings and machinery, capturing the essence of the new machine age.

### Futurism
Originating in Italy in the early 20th century, Futurism embraces modernity, speed, technology, and innovation. It often features dynamic movement and the energy of modern technology, and artwork in this style uses bold lines and vibrant colors to convey motion and progress.

### Baroque
The Baroque style emerged in the late 16th century in Europe and is characterized by dramatic use of light and shadow, grandeur, and emotional intensity. Baroque art often features dynamic compositions, ornate details, and rich color palettes to create a sense of awe.

### Dadaism
Dadaism began during World War I in Europe and is a form of artistic anarchy that challenges the traditional notions of art. It embraces absurdity, spontaneity, and the use of found objects. Dada art often employs satirical and nonsensical elements that subvert conventional aesthetics and societal norms.

## Examinations

### Stylistic Feature Analysis
This examination focuses on identifying the stylistic features of an artwork, such as the use of geometric shapes and the presence of figurative elements or symbolic imagery.

- **Lack of geometric shapes**: When a lack of geometric shapes is observed, **Futurism** and **Precisionism** are ruled out as possible styles.

### Chiaroscuro Contrast Measurement
Chiaroscuro measures the contrast between light and dark in an artwork.

- **Contrast range of 0.0 to 0.3**: If the contrast falls within this range, the style **Baroque** is excluded.

### Golden Ratio Application
This analysis investigates whether the composition of an artwork follows the golden ratio, a proportional guideline often used for aesthetic appeal.

- **Approximate use of the golden ratio**: If approximate use of the golden ratio is observed, **Futurism** and **Dadaism** are ruled out.

### UV Fluorescence Examination
This technique uses ultraviolet light to reveal details not visible to the naked eye, such as varnishes or modern pigments.

- **Modern pigments fluoresce brightly**: When this is observed, **Baroque** is excluded as a style.

### Medium Identification
This examination identifies the materials and techniques used to create an artwork.

- **Acrylic on canvas, Digital print, Spray paint on wall**: If these mediums are identified, **Baroque** is ruled out.

### Microscopic Fiber Analysis
This analysis detects the fibers present in the artworkâ€™s canvas or material.

- **Cotton fibers detected**: When cotton fibers are identified, the style **Baroque** is excluded.
- **Synthetic fibers detected**: If synthetic fibers are found, **Baroque** is ruled out.

By applying these examinations, along with their outcomes, you can systematically rule out certain artistic styles based on the characteristics observed in the artwork. This guide will help you recognize which styles are not applicable, allowing for a more focused and informed art analysis.
