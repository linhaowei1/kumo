# Art Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook is designed to assist art enthusiasts, students, and professionals in analyzing and categorizing artworks by examining various artistic styles and utilizing different examination methods. By understanding the outcomes of each examination, one can rule out certain artistic styles, narrowing down the possibilities. This guidebook covers four artistic styles and uses six types of examinations.

## Artistic Styles

### 1. Abstract Expressionism
Abstract Expressionism is characterized by a focus on spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation. It often lacks clear symbolic content and is marked by an emphasis on dynamic and expressive brushstrokes.
