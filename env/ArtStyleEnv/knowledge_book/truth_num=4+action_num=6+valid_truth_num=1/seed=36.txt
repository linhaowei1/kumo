# Art Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive understanding of different artistic styles and the examination processes used to analyze and authenticate artworks. It outlines specific examinations and outcomes that help rule out certain styles based on the observed characteristics. By understanding these concepts, you can better navigate the complex world of art analysis.

## Artistic Styles Overview

### Photography
Photography involves capturing images using cameras. It encompasses a variety of styles and techniques, from traditional film photography to modern digital methods. 

### Street Art
Street art is visual art created in public locations, often unsanctioned and characterized by its vibrant and urban aesthetic. It includes graffiti, murals, and installations, and can address social and political issues.

### Constructivism
Constructivism is an art and architectural philosophy originating in Russia in the 1920s, emphasizing abstract and geometric forms. It aimed to reflect modern industrial society and the power of art as a social tool.

### Digital Art
Digital art is created using digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process. It includes static and dynamic works such as digital paintings, 3D models, and interactive installations.

## Examination Processes

### 1. Stylistic Feature Analysis
This examination reviews the stylistic elements of an artwork to determine which styles can be ruled out:

- If there is a **lack of geometric shapes**, Constructivism is ruled out.
- No exclusions are placed for **emphasis on geometric shapes**, **high abstraction**, **figurative elements present**, or **use of symbolic imagery**.

### 2. Signature Authentication
This process involves examining any signatures on the artwork:

- If the **signature matches a known artist**, Street Art and Digital Art are ruled out. 
- No exclusions are provided if **no signature is found** or for a **questionable signature**.

### 3. Provenance Research
Investigating the history of ownership and documentation of an artwork can help in eliminating possibilities:

- If thereâ€™s a **documented history from the 18th century**, Digital Art is ruled out.
- There are no rules-out for **no documented provenance** or if **ownership is traced to modern collectors**.

### 4. Paint Age Dating
This examination dates paintings based on the age of the paint used:

- Artworks dated between **1475 and 1900**, including specific periods such as (1475, 1600), (1600, 1750), (1750, 1850), and (1850, 1900), will rule out Digital Art.
- No exclusions for artworks dated between **1950 and 2023**.

### 5. Pigment Composition Tests
This involves analyzing the pigments used in the artwork:

- If there are **historical pigments** present, such as lapis lazuli, Digital Art is ruled out.
- No exclusions are based on the presence of **synthetic**, **organic**, or **modern pigments** (e.g., titanium white).

### 6. Golden Ratio Application
This test evaluates whether the composition of the artwork follows the golden ratio:

- If the **composition follows the golden ratio**, Digital Art is ruled out.
- There are no exclusions based on **no application** or **approximate use** of the golden ratio.

By following these examinations and understanding their outcomes, you can accurately eliminate certain artistic styles from consideration, allowing for a clearer identification and appreciation of the artwork under study.
