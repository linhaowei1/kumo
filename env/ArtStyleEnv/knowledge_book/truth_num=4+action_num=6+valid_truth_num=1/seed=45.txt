# Art Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook is designed to help art enthusiasts and analysts understand different artistic styles and the methods of examination that can characterize or rule them out. By examining key factors and outcomes, you can narrow down the possible styles of a given artwork.

## Artistic Styles Overview

1. **Impasto**: Known for its thick, textured layers of paint that make the applied strokes visible and tactile. This style often makes use of three-dimensional qualities and intense, vivid colors.

2. **Conceptual Art**: Emphasizes the idea over the visual aspects of the work. Often eschews traditional aesthetics and techniques, focusing on conveying messages or concepts.

3. **Hyperrealism**: A genre of painting and sculpture resembling a high-resolution photograph. It often features meticulous detail and a focus on everyday subjects, highlighting realism and detail.

4. **Impressionism**: A movement characterized by thin brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light, ordinary subject matters, and movement.

## Examinations and Outcomes

Understanding these examinations can help art analysts rule out certain artistic styles based on observed outcomes.

### 1. Golden Ratio Application

- **Composition follows golden ratio**: If an artwork adheres strictly to the golden ratio, exclude **Conceptual Art** as a potential style.
- **No application of golden ratio**: No styles are ruled out when this outcome is observed.
- **Approximate use of golden ratio**: No styles are ruled out when this outcome is observed.

### 2. Chiaroscuro Contrast Measurement

- **(0.0, 0.3)**: No styles are ruled out when this range is observed.
- **(0.3, 0.6)**: No styles are ruled out when this range is observed.
- **(0.6, 1.0)**: If the contrast is high, exclude **Impressionism** as a potential style.

### 3. 3D Surface Profilometry

- **(0.0, 0.2)**: A low range on 3D surface profiling suggests you can exclude **Impasto**.
- **(0.2, 0.5)**: No styles are ruled out when this range is observed.
- **(0.5, 1.0)**: A high range on the profiling suggests ruling out **Hyperrealism** due to its typically smooth surfaces.

### 4. Color Palette Analysis

- **Dominant use of primary colors**: If these colors are prevalent, exclude **Impressionism** and **Hyperrealism**.
- **Monochromatic color scheme**: No styles are ruled out when this outcome is observed.
- **High contrast complementary colors**: If such colors are used, Hyperrealism should be ruled out.
- **Earth tones prevalent**: No styles are ruled out with this outcome.

### 5. Dust Particle Analysis

- **Modern pollutants detected**: No styles are ruled out if modern pollutants are found.
- **Historical pollutants detected**: If pollutants suggest historical origins, rule out **Conceptual Art**.
- **No pollutants detected**: No styles are ruled out when no pollutants are present.

### 6. Provenance Research

- **Documented history from 18th century**: If provenance links history to the 18th century, this rules out **Conceptual Art** which is typically modern.
- **No documented provenance**: No styles are ruled out with this outcome.
- **Ownership traced to modern collectors**: No styles are ruled out with this outcome.

By using this guidebook, art enthusiasts can navigate through various examinations to rule out certain artistic styles, helping to identify the potential origin and categorization of artworks more accurately.
