# Art Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive examination of various artistic styles and the analytical examinations used to explore them. Our focus will be on four major artistic styles: Digital Art, Constructivism, Pre-Raphaelite, and Impressionism. Each style will be introduced, followed by an explanation of analytical examinations and how their outcomes can lead to the exclusion of specific styles. This will aid art researchers and enthusiasts in better understanding and authenticating artworks within these categories.

## Artistic Styles

### Digital Art
- **Overview**: Digital Art is the creation of artworks through digital technology. It ranges from computer graphics to interactive installations.
- **Characteristics**: Often features pixel-based imagery, digital brushstrokes, and may include animations or interactive elements.

### Constructivism
- **Overview**: Emerging in the early 20th century, Constructivism is an artistic and architectural philosophy that originated in Russia.
- **Characteristics**: Known for its emphasis on geometric forms and minimalistic design, often eschewing traditional painting techniques.

### Pre-Raphaelite
- **Overview**: A mid-19th-century movement, the Pre-Raphaelites aimed to return to the detail, intense color, and complex compositions of Renaissance art.
- **Characteristics**: Focus on naturalistic and detailed representation, often with mythological or literary themes.

### Impressionism
- **Overview**: Originating in France in the late 19th century, Impressionism is characterized by small, thin brush strokes that emphasize depiction of light and its changing qualities.
- **Characteristics**: Often captures everyday subjects, and the emphasis is on the overall visual effect rather than detailed rendering.

## Examinations and Outcomes

  - **Composition follows golden ratio**: Excludes Digital Art.
  - **No application of golden ratio**: No exclusions apply.
  - **Approximate use of golden ratio**: No exclusions apply.

## Conclusion

By understanding the outcomes of these examinations and the rule-out process, art researchers and enthusiasts can confidently narrow down their analysis and authentication of artworks within these four artistic styles. This guide provides the necessary framework to effectively apply these examinations in identifying or excluding styles from consideration.
