# Mineral Classification Guidebook

## Introduction
Understanding the broader landscape of economic theories can be likened to classifying minerals, each with distinctive characteristics and principles. In this guide, we elaborate on four types of economic theories expressed metaphorically as 'mineral types': Developmental Economics, Monetarism, Marxist Economics, and Post-Keynesian Economics. Additionally, we introduce various 'experiments' or tests to understand eliminating or ruling out these economic theories based on observed 'outcomes'.

## Mineral Types

### 1. Developmental Economics
Developmental Economics focuses on the economic development process of countries, particularly the policies and conditions favorable for enhancing economic growth in developing nations. It often considers factors like demographic changes and the structural transformation of economies.

### 2. Monetarism
Monetarism is the economic theory that emphasizes the role of governments in controlling the amount of money in circulation. It often links issues like inflation, budget deficits, and capital flows to changes in the money supply and advocates for controlled government intervention.

### 3. Marxist Economics
Marxist Economics analyzes the effects of capitalism on labor, productivity, and economic development. It is grounded in the theories of Karl Marx, which emphasize class struggles and the impact of capitalist economies on social structures.

### 4. Post-Keynesian Economics
Post-Keynesian Economics builds on the ideas of John Maynard Keynes, focusing on the role of uncertainty and the impact of demand on economic activity. It is often associated with policies designed to achieve full employment and stabilize economic cycles.

## Experiments and Outcomes

The following experiments help us determine which 'mineral types' or economic theories can be ruled out based on the observed outcomes.

### 1. Examine Unemployment Trends
- **Outcome (0.1, 10.0):** Observing a significant rise in unemployment trends helps rule out **Post-Keynesian Economics**, which traditionally aims for full employment.

### 2. Evaluate Budget Deficits/Surpluses
- **Outcome (-10.0, -1.0):** A substantial reduction in budget deficits suggests the exclusion of **Monetarism**, which emphasizes concerns over deficits.
- **Outcome (-1.0, 1.0) & (1.0, 10.0):** No particular theories are ruled out within these ranges.

### 3. Study Demographic Changes
- **Aging Population:** An aging demographic helps rule out **Developmental Economics**, which focuses more on youthful and growing populations.

### 4. Evaluate Capital Flows
- **Outcome (-100.0, -1.0):** A major outflow of capital is typically not aligned with **Monetarism**, which seeks to control such flows.
- **Outcome (-1.0, 1.0) & (1.0, 100.0):** No particular theories are ruled out within these ranges.

### 5. Study Trade Balance Changes
- **Outcome (-1.0, 1.0):** Observing little to no change in the trade balance can help rule out **Monetarism**, which often correlates trade imbalances with shifts in money supply.
  
### 6. Examine Savings Rates
- **Outcome (15.0, 30.0):** A significantly high savings rate suggests excluding **Monetarism**, which typically expresses concerns over high savings leading to reduced spending.

## Conclusion

By understanding these economic theories and experiments, one can analyze and rule out certain possibilities based on observed conditions, much like a geologist eliminating mineral options through various tests. This systematic approach ensures a careful examination of each theory's applicable context, helping in academic analysis and real-world application.
