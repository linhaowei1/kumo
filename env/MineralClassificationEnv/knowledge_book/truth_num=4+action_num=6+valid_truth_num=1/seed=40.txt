# Mineral Classification Guidebook

In this guidebook, we will explore how to classify various theoretical "mineral types" using specific experimental "tests." These mineral types represent key economic theories and principles, while the tests correspond to different economic measurements and behaviors. For each experiment, certain outcomes will indicate which mineral types can be excluded from consideration. This method of discovery is crucial for refining our understanding of economic phenomena.

## Mineral Types

1. **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**
   - Suggests that financial markets are informationally efficient, meaning current asset prices fully reflect all available information.

2. **Environmental Economics**
   - Focuses on the economic impacts of environmental policies and how economic incentives can conserve resources and reduce pollution.

3. **Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH)**
   - Proposes that individuals plan their consumption and savings behavior based on their expected long-term average income rather than their current income.

4. **Neoclassical Economics**
   - Characterized by the focus on determining goods, outputs, and income distributions in markets through supply and demand.

## Experiments and Outcomes

### 1. Examine Unemployment Trends

- **Outcome Range**: (-10.0, -0.1)
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: Neoclassical Economics
  - Interpretation: If significant decreases in unemployment are observed, Neoclassical Economics is inconsistent with this outcome.

- **Outcome Range**: (-0.1, 0.1)
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: None
  - Interpretation: Marginal changes in unemployment do not help exclude any specific mineral types.

- **Outcome Range**: (0.1, 10.0)
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: None
  - Interpretation: Increases in unemployment also do not rule out any specific mineral types.

### 2. Assess Consumption Patterns

- **Outcome**: High MPC (Marginal Propensity to Consume)
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: Permanent Income Hypothesis
  - Interpretation: When high propensity to consume out of additional income is observed, the Permanent Income Hypothesis may not apply.

- **Outcome**: Low MPC
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: None
  - Interpretation: A low marginal propensity to consume does not exclude any mineral types.

### 3. Analyze Financial Market Stability

- **Outcome**: Instability
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: Efficient Market Hypothesis
  - Interpretation: Instability in financial markets contradicts the Efficient Market Hypothesis, suggesting this mineral type should be ruled out.

- **Outcome**: Stability
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: None
  - Interpretation: Stable financial markets do not exclude any specific mineral types.

### 4. Study Government Expenditure Impacts

- **Outcome**: Crowding out
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: None
  - Interpretation: The occurrence of crowding out does not exclude any mineral types.

- **Outcome**: No crowding out
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: Neoclassical Economics
  - Interpretation: When government spending does not crowd out private investment, Neoclassical Economics should be ruled out.

### 5. Investigate Changes in GDP Growth

- **Outcome Range**: (5.0, 10.0)
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: Neoclassical Economics
  - Interpretation: Substantial GDP growth inconsistent with Neoclassical Economics suggests ruling it out.

- **Outcome Range**: (0.0, 5.0)
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: None
  - Interpretation: Moderate GDP growth does not exclude any mineral types.

- **Outcome Range**: (-10.0, 0.0)
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: None
  - Interpretation: GDP contraction does not rule out any specific mineral types.

### 6. Analyze Income Inequality

- **Outcome Range**: (0.0, 0.3)
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: None
  - Interpretation: Low levels of income inequality do not exclude any mineral types.

- **Outcome Range**: (0.3, 0.5)
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: None
  - Interpretation: Moderate income inequality does not exclude any mineral types.

- **Outcome Range**: (0.5, 1.0)
  - **Minerals Ruled Out**: Neoclassical Economics
  - Interpretation: High income inequality suggests Neoclassical Economics may not provide an accurate perspective, ruling it out.

This guidebook outlines a clear framework to assess various economic theories through specific experimental outcomes, allowing for a systematic approach to rule out certain theories under specific conditions. Understanding these relationships helps refine economic analysis and guides focused inquiries into human behaviors and economic systems.
