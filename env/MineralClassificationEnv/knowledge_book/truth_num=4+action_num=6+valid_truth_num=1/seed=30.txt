# Mineral Classification Guidebook

Welcome to the Mineral Classification Guidebook, designed to help you navigate the complex world of minerals through a series of experiments and outcomes. This guidebook details different "mineral types" represented by economic theories and describes how specific tests can rule out certain theories based on observed outcomes. Our goal is to clarify which mineral types are not applicable under given circumstances, allowing for a more targeted approach to analysis.

## Mineral Types

1. **Real Business Cycle Theory**: This refers to the theory that cycles in economic activity are driven by real (i.e., non-monetary) shocks, such as changes in technology or resources.

2. **Libertarian Economics**: A school of thought emphasizing individual liberty, minimal state intervention, and free markets. It often proposes minimal government spending, taxation, and regulation.

3. **Austrian School**: An economic methodology that emphasizes the spontaneous organizing power of the price mechanism. It stresses the inefficiency of central planning and the need for individual freedom in the marketplace.

4. **Rational Expectations Theory**: A theory proposing that individuals base their decisions on the best available information and learn from past experiences, leading to outcomes that are on average correct.

## Experiments and Outcomes

The following experiments are designed to help determine which mineral types (the economic theories) can be ruled out based on specific outcomes. Remember, an observed outcome excludes the listed mineral types.

### 1. Assess Investment Levels

- **Outcomes and Exclusions**:
  - Investment range of **0.0 to 5.0**: Rules out the **Austrian School**.
  - Investment range of **5.0 to 15.0**: No exclusions.
  - Investment range of **15.0 to 30.0**: No exclusions.

### 2. Analyze Consumer Confidence

- **Outcomes and Exclusions**:
  - Consumer confidence index ranging from **0.0 to 50.0**: No exclusions.
  - Consumer confidence index from **50.0 to 100.0**: Rules out **Rational Expectations Theory**.

### 3. Analyze Business Cycle Fluctuations

- **Outcomes and Exclusions**:
  - **Frequent cycles**: Rules out **Real Business Cycle Theory**.
  - **Smoothed cycles**: No exclusions.

### 4. Assess Consumption Patterns

- **Outcomes and Exclusions**:
  - **High Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)**: Rules out **Rational Expectations Theory**.
  - **Low MPC**: No exclusions.

### 5. Study Effects on Healthcare Systems

- **Outcomes and Exclusions**:
  - **Universal coverage**: Rules out **Libertarian Economics**.
  - **Private insurance**: No exclusions.

### 6. Evaluate Budget Deficits/Surpluses

- **Outcomes and Exclusions**:
  - Budget change from **-10.0 to -1.0**: No exclusions.
  - Budget change from **-1.0 to 1.0**: No exclusions.
  - Budget change from **1.0 to 10.0**: Rules out the **Austrian School**.

## Conclusion

By systematically conducting these experiments and observing the outcomes, you'll be able to effectively rule out the mineral types that do not apply, thus honing in on the most likely candidates for further exploration. This guidebook serves as a roadmap to understanding how these economic theories interact with different economic conditions. Remember, the exclusion of certain theories helps streamline your focus, making your analysis more efficient and accurate.
