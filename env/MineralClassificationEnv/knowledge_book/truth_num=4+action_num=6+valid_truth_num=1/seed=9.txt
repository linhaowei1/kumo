# Mineral Classification Guidebook

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on classifying unique mineral types through various experimental tests. This guidebook focuses on interpreting outcomes from specific experiments to rule out certain mineral types. The mineral types explored in this guidebook include Efficient Market Hypothesis, Austrian School, Behavioral Economics, and Developmental Economics. Each mineral classification is studied through a series of specified experiments, with outcomes that help to exclude certain mineral types.

## Mineral Types Overview

### 1. Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
The Efficient Market Hypothesis suggests that financial markets are efficient in reflecting all available information. It is often associated with scenarios involving financial market stability and instances of market reactions to events.

### 2. Austrian School
This mineral type is characterized by its focus on individual market actions, especially concerning the implications of inflation and interest rates on economic functioning. It often comes into play in scenarios involving interest rate effects and low investment levels.

### 3. Behavioral Economics
Behavioral Economics examines how psychological influences affect the economic decision-making processes of individuals and institutions. It can be related to market stability and inflation impacts.

### 4. Developmental Economics
Developmental Economics pertains to the understanding and enhancement of economic systems in developing countries, often linked with demographic changes affecting the economy.

## Experiments and Outcome Interpretations

### 1. Analyze Impact on Inflation
This experiment examines how inflation rates influence or are influenced by economic theories.

- **Outcome Range (5.0, 20.0):** If inflation rates fall within this range, **Behavioral Economics is ruled out**.
- **Outcome Range (2.0, 5.0):** If seen, **Austrian School is ruled out**.
- **Outcome Range (0.0, 2.0):** No associated mineral types are ruled out in this range.

### 2. Study Demographic Changes
This experiment looks at how demographic shifts impact economics.

- **Aging Population:** If this demographic is observed, **Developmental Economics is ruled out**.
- **Youthful Population:** No exclusions are applicable in this scenario.

### 3. Analyze Financial Market Stability
Evaluating market stability can aid in the classification of certain mineral types.

- **Instability:** When instability is detected, **Efficient Market Hypothesis is ruled out**.
- **Stability:** If the market is stable, **Behavioral Economics is ruled out**.

### 4. Assess Investment Levels
Investment levels are assessed to refine mineral type classifications.

- **Investment Range (0.0, 5.0):** If investment falls within this range, **Austrian School is ruled out**.
- **Investment Range (5.0, 15.0):** No mineral types are ruled out here.
- **Investment Range (15.0, 30.0):** No exclusions apply in this range.

### 5. Evaluate Fiscal Multipliers
Fiscal multipliers are analyzed to gauge the effect of fiscal policy on economic growth.

- **Multiplier Range (1.5, 3.0):** No mineral types are excluded with this outcome.
- **Multiplier Range (0.5, 1.5):** Observing this implies that **Austrian School is ruled out**.
- **Multiplier Range (-1.0, 0.5):** No exclusions apply here.

### 6. Study Effects on Interest Rates
Interest rates impact a variety of economic conditions.

- **Rate Range (0.0, 2.0):** No mineral types are excluded here.
- **Rate Range (2.0, 5.0):** This scenario does not rule out any mineral types.
- **Rate Range (5.0, 10.0):** If interest rates fall within this range, **Austrian School is ruled out**.

This guidebook aims at facilitating clear and efficient classification of the specified mineral types through thoughtful analysis of outcomes derived from targeted experiments. By understanding the relationships and exclusions within each scenario, practitioners can better assess and categorize the mineral types present.
