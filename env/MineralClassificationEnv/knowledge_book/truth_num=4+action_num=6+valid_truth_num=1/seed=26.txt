# Mineral Classification Guidebook

Welcome to the Mineral Classification Guidebook, designed to help you navigate through the fascinating world of mineral identification through various experiments. This guide will introduce you to four theoretical mineral types: Ecological Economics, Mercantilism, Monetarism, and Austrian School. By conducting specific experiments, we can rule out certain minerals as possibilities. Letâ€™s explore these mineral types and the associated experiments to better understand how we achieve this.

## Mineral Types Overview

1. **Ecological Economics**: This mineral type emphasizes the importance of ecological health and sustainability in economic processes.

2. **Mercantilism**: A mineral type focusing on maximizing trade surpluses through protectionist economic policy.

3. **Monetarism**: This type prioritizes economic stability through controlling the supply of money and emphasizes the role of monetary policy.

4. **Austrian School**: Characterized by its focus on individual action, capital allocation, and the effects of monetary policy on investing and economic cycles.

## Experiments and Rule-Out Criteria

### 1. Evaluate Budget Deficits/Surpluses
- **Experiment Description**: Assessing how financial deficits or surpluses impact the economy.
  - **Outcomes**:
    - (-10.0, -1.0): Rule out Monetarism
    - (-1.0, 1.0): No mineral types are ruled out.
    - (1.0, 10.0): Rule out Austrian School

### 2. Study Trade Balance Changes
- **Experiment Description**: Analyzing shifts in a country's import-export balance.
  - **Outcomes**:
    - (-10.0, -1.0): No mineral types are ruled out.
    - (-1.0, 1.0): Rule out Monetarism
    - (1.0, 10.0): Rule out Mercantilism

### 3. Evaluate Capital Flows
- **Experiment Description**: Examining the movement of capital between countries or markets.
  - **Outcomes**:
    - (-100.0, -1.0): Rule out Monetarism
    - (-1.0, 1.0): No mineral types are ruled out.
    - (1.0, 100.0): No mineral types are ruled out.

### 4. Assess Investment Levels
- **Experiment Description**: Evaluating the levels of investment in the economy.
  - **Outcomes**:
    - (0.0, 5.0): Rule out Austrian School
    - (5.0, 15.0): No mineral types are ruled out.
    - (15.0, 30.0): No mineral types are ruled out.

### 5. Evaluate Fiscal Multipliers
- **Experiment Description**: Understanding the effect of fiscal policy on economic output.
  - **Outcomes**:
    - (1.5, 3.0): Rule out Monetarism
    - (0.5, 1.5): Rule out Austrian School
    - (-1.0, 0.5): No mineral types are ruled out.

### 6. Examine Labor Productivity
- **Experiment Description**: Studying the efficiency of labor force usage in the economy.
  - **Outcomes**:
    - (0.0, 1.0): No mineral types are ruled out.
    - (1.0, 3.0): No mineral types are ruled out.
    - (3.0, 5.0): Rule out Austrian School

By systematically applying these experiments and observing the outcomes, we can effectively narrow down which mineral types can be excluded. This guide provides you with a structured approach, helping you refine your analysis in the field of mineral classification according to these economic theories.
