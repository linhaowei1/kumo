# Mineral Classification Guidebook

Welcome to the Mineral Classification Guidebook. In this guide, we help you navigate the complex terrain of identifying different theoretical frameworks, referred to here as "minerals," through a series of "experiments" or tests. Each test result will help exclude certain mineral types from the pool of possibilities, aiding you in pinpointing the most likely candidates.

## Mineral Types

1. **Classical Economics**: This type posits that free markets are most effective and government intervention should be minimal. It often emphasizes the importance of production, labor markets, and capital flows in achieving economic equilibrium.

2. **Monetarism**: Characterized by its focus on the role of government in controlling the supply of money. Monetarists assert that changes in the money supply can have profound effects on national output and inflation over time.

3. **Supply-Side Economics**: This mineral type focuses on boosting economic growth by increasing the supply of goods. It highlights the significance of tax cuts, deregulation, and reducing barriers to production as means to enhance economic welfare.

4. **Life-Cycle Hypothesis**: A framework that discusses individual consumption and saving habits over their lifetime, emphasizing the predictability of consumption patterns across different life stages.

## Experiments and Outcomes

In the following sections, we explore different experiments. Each experiment derives its significance from the ability to rule out certain mineral types based on observed outcomes. 

### 1. Assess Consumption Patterns

**Objective**: To understand how consumption changes with variations in income.

- **High MPC (Marginal Propensity to Consume)**:
  - **Rule Out**: Life-Cycle Hypothesis
  
- **Low MPC**:
  - **No mineral types are eliminated**.

### 2. Evaluate Capital Flows

**Objective**: To gauge the effects of capital movement on the economic framework.

- **Capital Flow Range (-100.0 to -1.0)**:
  - **Rule Out**: Monetarism

- **Capital Flow Range (-1.0 to 1.0)**:
  - **Rule Out**: Classical Economics

- **Capital Flow Range (1.0 to 100.0)**:
  - **Rule Out**: Supply-Side Economics

### 3. Study Government Expenditure Impacts

**Objective**: To analyze how government spending affects the market.

- **Crowding Out**:
  - **No mineral types are eliminated**.

- **No Crowding Out**:
  - **Rule Out**: Classical Economics

### 4. Examine Labor Productivity

**Objective**: Measure changes in productivity relative to labor inputs.

- **Labor Productivity Range (0.0 to 1.0)**:
  - **No mineral types are eliminated**.

- **Labor Productivity Range (1.0 to 3.0)**:
  - **Rule Out**: Classical Economics

- **Labor Productivity Range (3.0 to 5.0)**:
  - **Rule Out**: Supply-Side Economics

### 5. Evaluate Budget Deficits/Surpluses

**Objective**: To observe the impact of budgetary imbalances on the economy.

- **Deficit/Surplus Range (-10.0 to -1.0)**:
  - **Rule Out**: Classical Economics, Monetarism

- **Deficit/Surplus Range (-1.0 to 1.0)**:
  - **No mineral types are eliminated**.

- **Deficit/Surplus Range (1.0 to 10.0)**:
  - **Rule Out**: Supply-Side Economics

### 6. Examine Monopoly Power

**Objective**: To determine the effect of market concentration on economic dynamics.

- **High Concentration**:
  - **Rule Out**: Classical Economics

- **Low Concentration**:
  - **No mineral types are eliminated**.

## Conclusion

By employing these tests, you can systematically exclude certain mineral types and guide your analysis towards the most plausible economic framework. This methodical approach ensures clarity in understanding and applying economic theories within various contexts.
