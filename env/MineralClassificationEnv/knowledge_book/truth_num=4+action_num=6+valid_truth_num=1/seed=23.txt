# Mineral Classification Guidebook

Welcome to the Mineral Classification Guidebook, where we break down the complex world of mineral identification into simple terms. In this guide, we focus on understanding different mineral types and how specific experiments can help rule out possibilities. Our mineral types are represented by different economic theories, and through a series of experiments, we aim to observe specific outcomes that help us exclude certain types.

## Mineral Types

In this guide, we use the metaphor of mineral types to represent various economic theories:

1. **Libertarian Economics**: Focuses on minimal government intervention and maximizes individual freedom in economic affairs.

2. **Post-Keynesian Economics**: Emphasizes the role of demand management in the economy and often supports active government intervention.

3. **Rational Expectations Theory**: Suggests that individuals make decisions based on their rational outlook, available information, and past experiences.

4. **Environmental Economics**: Concentrates on the environmental impacts of economic activity and sustainable development.

## Experiments and Observations

To determine which mineral (economic theory) you are dealing with, perform the following experiments and observe the outcomes to rule out certain types.

### 1. Examine Unemployment Trends

- **If unemployment trends are between 0.1% and 10.0%**, rule out **Post-Keynesian Economics**, as this range suggests behaviors inconsistent with typical Post-Keynesian responses.

### 2. Assess Environmental Impacts

- **Negative externalities observed**: No economic theories can be ruled out based on negative environmental impacts alone, as they do not distinctly indicate the presence of one over others.

- **Sustainable development practices**: Rule out **Environmental Economics**, as all other types typically overlook the direct aim for sustainable development.

### 3. Study Effects on Healthcare Systems

- **Universal coverage implemented**: Here, you can rule out **Libertarian Economics**, which typically advocates for limited government roles in health coverage.

- **Private insurance dominance**: No economic theories are eliminated when private insurance dominates, as this could occur under any examined theory.

### 4. Analyze Impact on Inflation

- **Inflation rates between 5.0% and 20.0%**: This scenario rules out **Rational Expectations Theory**, as this theory presupposes that such high inflation rates should have been anticipated and mitigated.

- **Inflation rates between 0.0% and 2.0%**: Again, there are no clear exclusions based on such moderate inflation rates.

### 5. Evaluate Fiscal Multipliers

- **Multipliers between 0.5 and 1.5**: Rule out **Rational Expectations Theory**, which presumes that actions leading to such moderate fiscal multipliers are already counteracted.

- **Multipliers between -1.0 and 0.5**: Under these conditions, rule out **Post-Keynesian Economics**, where usually larger effects from fiscal actions are expected.

### 6. Assess Consumption Patterns

- **High Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)**: Rule out **Rational Expectations Theory**, as it implies these consumption behaviors should already be predicted and balanced out.

- **Low MPC**: No economic theories are distinctly eliminated through observation of low MPC alone.

## Conclusion

By following the experiments outlined above, you can systematically rule out certain economic theories, effectively narrowing down the possibilities and better understanding the underlying economic principles at play. Remember, this classification is a process of elimination based on observed outcomes rather than confirmation of any particular mineral type.
