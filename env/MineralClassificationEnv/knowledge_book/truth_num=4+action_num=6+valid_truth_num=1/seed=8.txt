# Mineral Classification Guidebook

Welcome to the Mineral Classification Guidebook, a comprehensive guide designed to help you understand and evaluate various mineral types through different economic experiments. Mineral classification in this context is metaphorically used to discuss various economic theories and their applications. This guide will walk you through the mineral types, corresponding experiments, and outcomes that help exclude certain economic theories based on observed results.

## Mineral Types

This guide examines four key economic theories. Each theory is treated as a "mineral type" for the purpose of classification:

1. **Socialist Economics**
2. **Behavioral Economics**
3. **New Keynesian Economics**
4. **Monopoly Theory**

## Experiments and Outcomes

Below, we detail a set of experiments that can provide insights into these economic theories. For each experiment, specific outcomes help to **eliminate** certain theories from consideration, based on the observed economic conditions.

### Experiment 1: Study Effects on Interest Rates

This experiment evaluates how different economic theories affect interest rates:

- **0.0 - 2.0%**: No theories are ruled out.
- **2.0 - 5.0%**: No theories are ruled out.
- **5.0 - 10.0%**: **New Keynesian Economics** is ruled out.

### Experiment 2: Analyze Market Competition

This experiment investigates the impact of various theories on market competition conditions:

- **Perfect Competition**: **Monopoly Theory** is ruled out.
- **Monopolistic Competition**: No theories are ruled out.

### Experiment 3: Study Effects on Healthcare Systems

This experiment assesses how different economic theories influence healthcare systems:

- **Universal Coverage**: No theories are ruled out.
- **Private Insurance**: **Socialist Economics** is ruled out.

### Experiment 4: Analyze Financial Market Stability

This experiment evaluates the stability of financial markets under different economic theories:

- **Instability**: No theories are ruled out.
- **Stability**: **Behavioral Economics** is ruled out.

### Experiment 5: Assess Consumption Patterns

This experiment observes the spending habits influenced by different economic theories:

- **High Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)**: No theories are ruled out.
- **Low MPC**: **Behavioral Economics** is ruled out.

### Experiment 6: Analyze Impact on Inflation

This experiment studies the effects of different economic theories on inflation:

- **5.0 - 20.0%**: **Behavioral Economics** and **New Keynesian Economics** are ruled out.
- **2.0 - 5.0%**: No theories are ruled out.
- **0.0 - 2.0%**: No theories are ruled out.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a structured approach to explore and dissect influential economic theories by metaphorically treating them as mineral types. By observing specific outcomes of economic experiments, certain theories can be systematically ruled out, aiding in the understanding and analysis of complex economic dynamics.

We hope this guide serves as a valuable resource in your exploration of economic theories and their applications!
