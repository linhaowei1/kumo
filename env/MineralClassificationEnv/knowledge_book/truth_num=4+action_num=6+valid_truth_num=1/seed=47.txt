# Mineral Classification Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook serves as a comprehensive manual for understanding and classifying various mineral types through a series of experiments. The mineral types in focus are analogous to different economic theories that are explored through experimental outcomes. In this context, each experiment provides specific observations that help eliminate certain mineral (or theory) types from consideration. By analyzing these outcomes, one can narrow down the potential mineral types.

## Mineral Types

1. **Behavioral Economics**: This type emphasizes the influence of psychological factors and social influences on economic decision-making and financial market behaviors.

2. **Post-Keynesian Economics**: This approach focuses on macroeconomic issues such as full employment, the role of money, and effective demand.

3. **Monetarism**: A school of thought that emphasizes the role of government in controlling the amount of money in circulation, primarily through managing monetary policy to regulate inflation and economic performance.

4. **Real Business Cycle Theory**: This theory suggests that business cycle fluctuations can largely be accounted for by real (in contrast to nominal) shocks, such as changes in technology or supply crises, rather than monetary shocks.

## Experiments and Interpretation of Results

### 1. Examine Unemployment Trends

Outcomes:
- **Observed Change: Decrease (-10.0, -0.1)** → All mineral types could still apply; no eliminations.
- **Observed Change: Stability (-0.1, 0.1)** → Rule out "Real Business Cycle Theory."
- **Observed Change: Increase (0.1, 10.0)** → Rule out "Post-Keynesian Economics."

### 2. Evaluate Budget Deficits/Surpluses

Outcomes:
- **Observed State: Large Deficit (-10.0, -1.0)** → Rule out "Monetarism."
- **Observed State: Close to Balance (-1.0, 1.0)** → All mineral types could still apply; no eliminations.
- **Observed State: Large Surplus (1.0, 10.0)** → All mineral types could still apply; no eliminations.

### 3. Analyze Financial Market Stability

Outcomes:
- **Observed State: Instability** → All mineral types could still apply; no eliminations.
- **Observed State: Stability** → Rule out "Behavioral Economics."

### 4. Investigate Changes in GDP Growth

Outcomes:
- **Observed Growth: Strong (5.0, 10.0)** → All mineral types could still apply; no eliminations.
- **Observed Growth: Moderate (0.0, 5.0)** → All mineral types could still apply; no eliminations.
- **Observed Contraction (-10.0, 0.0)** → Rule out "Monetarism."

### 5. Examine Velocity of Money

Outcomes:
- **Observed Velocity: Low (0.0, 1.0)** → Rule out "Monetarism."
- **Observed Velocity: Moderate (1.0, 3.0)** → All mineral types could still apply; no eliminations.

### 6. Analyze Impact on Inflation

Outcomes:
- **Observed Inflation: High (5.0, 20.0)** → Rule out "Behavioral Economics."
- **Observed Inflation: Moderate (2.0, 5.0)** → Rule out "Monetarism."
- **Observed Inflation: Low (0.0, 2.0)** → All mineral types could still apply; no eliminations.

## Conclusion

By systematically applying these experiments and understanding the effects of various conditions on the mineral types, users can effectively narrow down potential classifications. Each experiment provides crucial insights into eliminating possibilities, steadily guiding toward a more precise classification.
