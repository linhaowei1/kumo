# Mineral Classification Guidebook

Welcome to the Mineral Classification Guidebook, a resource designed to help you understand and differentiate between various mineral types using specific experimental observations. By following a systematic approach to each experiment, you'll learn how to exclude certain mineral types based on observed outcomes. This guide will focus on the following mineral types and experiments:

## Mineral Types

1. **Developmental Economics**: This mineral type focuses on the economic aspects of improving the quality of life and economic health of a specific area, typically in developing regions. It often examines factors such as investment in human capital, infrastructure, and institutional development.

2. **Libertarian Economics**: Rooted in free-market principles, this mineral emphasizes minimal government intervention and champions individual liberties concerning economic transactions and decisions.

3. **Mercantilism**: This mineral type attributes economic strength to the accumulation of gold and silver, advocating for a positive trade balance through exports, while minimizing imports. It emphasizes national economic policy and government regulation to achieve these goals.

4. **Classical Economics**: Stemming from the thoughts of economists like Adam Smith, this mineral type highlights the importance of free markets, competitive economies, and the role of supply and demand in resource allocation.

## Experiments and Observations

1. **Study Trade Balance Changes**: 
   - Positive Changes (1.0, 10.0): When you observe an increase in trade balance, it rules out **Mercantilism**.
   - Neutral Changes (-1.0, 1.0): When changes are neutral, with no significant increase or decrease, it rules out **Classical Economics**.
   - Negative Changes (-10.0, -1.0): No specific mineral types are ruled out, allowing all possibilities to remain.

2. **Evaluate Effects on Supply Chain**:
   - Stability: If the supply chain is stable, you can rule out **Classical Economics**.
   - Disruptions: Observation of disruptions doesn't rule out any specific mineral types.

3. **Study Demographic Changes**:
   - Aging Population: Observing an aging population within a region rules out **Developmental Economics**.
   - Youthful Population: A predominantly youthful demographic rules out **Classical Economics**.

4. **Evaluate Budget Deficits/Surpluses**:
   - Negative (-10.0, -1.0): When observing significant budget deficits, **Classical Economics** can be ruled out.
   - Neutral (-1.0, 1.0) and Positive (1.0, 10.0): These observations do not rule out any mineral types.

5. **Examine Unemployment Trends**:
   - Significant Increase (0.1, 10.0) or Minimal Change (-0.1, 0.1): If either trend is observed, no mineral types are ruled out.
   - Reduction (-10.0, -0.1): Observing a reduction in unemployment levels rules out **Classical Economics**.

6. **Evaluate Capital Flows**:
   - Neutral Flow (-1.0, 1.0): If capital flows exhibit little to no change, **Classical Economics** is ruled out.
   - Negative Flows (-100.0, -1.0) and Positive Flows (1.0, 100.0): These observations do not rule out any mineral types.

### Conclusion

Using this guide, you can effectively perform experiments and observations to systematically exclude certain mineral types. By understanding these distinct economic frameworks, you will be better equipped to analyze various economic phenomena through a mineral classification lens. Remember, the goal is to eliminate possibilities based on experimental outcomes, narrowing down the remaining valid mineral types for further exploration.
