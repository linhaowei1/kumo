## Mineral Classification Guidebook

Welcome to the Mineral Classification Guidebook, where we explore different types of theoretical "minerals" and how various factors can be used to understand and differentiate between them. Our unusual "minerals" include foundational economic theories: Monetarism, Permanent Income Hypothesis, Real Business Cycle Theory, and Supply-Side Economics. Through specific experiments, we investigate the outcomes to determine which theories can be ruled out based on observed data. Below is an organized guide to understanding these theories, experiments, and the resulting outcomes.

## Mineral Types

1. **Monetarism**
   - A theory focusing on the role of governments in controlling the amount of money in circulation.
   
2. **Permanent Income Hypothesis**
   - A theory suggesting that people will spend money at a level consistent with their expected long-term average income.
   
3. **Real Business Cycle Theory**
   - A theory stating that economic fluctuations can largely be explained by real (in contrast to nominal) shocks, like changes in technology or resource availability.
   
4. **Supply-Side Economics**
   - A theory emphasizing the importance of tax cuts and deregulation to stimulate economic production and growth.

## Experiments and Rule-Out Outcomes

### 1. Assess Consumption Patterns
This experiment examines how individuals adjust their spending in response to income changes. We look for high or low marginal propensities to consume (MPC).

- **High MPC**: If high MPC is observed, the Permanent Income Hypothesis can be excluded as it assumes consumption smoothing over time, indicating a different spending pattern.
  
- **Low MPC**: No specific exclusions are made when low MPC is observed.

### 2. Examine Labor Productivity
This experiment measures the efficiency of labor inputs to produce economic output.

- **Productivity Range 0.0 - 1.0**: No exclusions.
  
- **Productivity Range 1.0 - 3.0**: No exclusions.
  
- **Productivity Range 3.0 - 5.0**: When labor productivity falls within this range, Supply-Side Economics can be excluded. This exclusion is based on observed productivity levels that do not align with the typical enhancements predicted by Supply-Side Economics.

### 3. Analyze Business Cycle Fluctuations
This experiment examines the frequency and impact of economic cycles.

- **Frequent Cycles**: Observing frequent cycles allows us to rule out Real Business Cycle Theory, as it generally predicts smoother cycles given real shocks.
  
- **Smoothed Cycles**: No specific exclusions are made.

### 4. Examine Savings Rates
This experiment involves measuring how much income individuals save over various income ranges.

- **Savings Rate 0.0 - 5.0%**: No exclusions.
  
- **Savings Rate 5.0 - 15.0%**: No exclusions.
  
- **Savings Rate 15.0 - 30.0%**: High savings rates here rule out Monetarism, as it would usually predict lower savings based on its emphasis on the money supply's role.

### 5. Examine Velocity of Money
This experiment measures the rate at which money circulates in the economy.

- **Velocity Range 0.0 - 1.0**: Low velocity of money indicates Monetarism can be excluded, as this theory often assumes a more active circulation.
  
- **Velocity Range 1.0 - 3.0**: No exclusions.

### 6. Analyze Income Inequality
This experiment examines the distribution of income across different population segments.

- **Inequality Range 0.0 - 0.3**: No exclusions.
  
- **Inequality Range 0.3 - 0.5**: No exclusions.
  
- **Inequality Range 0.5 - 1.0**: High inequality suggests that Supply-Side Economics can be ruled out, as this theory typically argues for the trickle-down effect which would ideally lead to more balanced income distribution.

Through these experiments, observers can narrow down which economic theories do not fit observed data and hence rule them out from consideration. By systematically applying these tests and understanding the outcomes, the complex world of economic theories becomes more navigable.
