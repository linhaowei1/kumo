# Mineral Classification Guidebook

Welcome to the Mineral Classification Guidebook, where we delve into understanding various unique mineral types through a series of experimental evaluations. This guidebook is structured to provide a clear and concise understanding of how different types of minerals—conceptualized here as economic theories—can be distinguished based on observable outcomes from specific experiments. Let's journey into the fascinating world of economic thoughts conceptualized as mineral types and discover how to classify them through analytical experiments.

## Mineral Types Explained

### 1. Keynesian Economics
Keynesian Economics is a theory emphasizing total spending in the economy and its effects on output and inflation. This theory suggests that active government intervention is essential for providing economic stability and growth.

### 2. Monopoly Theory
Monopoly Theory examines how a single company or group dominates a particular market or commodity, potentially leading to less competition and higher prices for consumers.

### 3. Real Business Cycle Theory
This theory proposes that economic fluctuations result from real (in contrast to monetary) shocks, such as changes in technology or resource availability, affecting economic decisions.

### 4. Austrian School
The Austrian School emphasizes the importance of individual actions and decisions, focusing on the concepts of opportunity costs, inflation, and market signals without government intervention.

## Experimental Evaluations

### 1. Analyze Impact on Inflation
This experiment evaluates how various mineral types influence inflation rates within the economy. The possible outcomes and exclusions are:
- **Inflation (2.0 to 5.0)%:** Rule out Austrian School.
- **Inflation (0.0 to 2.0)%:** Rule out Keynesian Economics.
- **Inflation (5.0 to 20.0)%:** Does not exclude any mineral type based on given data.

### 2. Examine Velocity of Money
This test identifies the speed at which money circulates within the economy:
- **Velocity (1.0 to 3.0):** Rule out Keynesian Economics.
- **Velocity (0.0 to 1.0):** Does not exclude any mineral type.

### 3. Analyze Business Cycle Fluctuations
This analysis looks at the frequency and nature of economic fluctuations:
- **Frequent Cycles:** Rule out Real Business Cycle Theory.
- **Smoothed Cycles:** Rule out Keynesian Economics.

### 4. Investigate Changes in GDP Growth
This test observes variations in GDP growth to highlight economic impact:
- **GDP Growth (0.0 to 5.0)%:** Rule out Keynesian Economics.
- **GDP Growth (5.0 to 10.0)% and (-10.0 to 0.0)%:** Does not exclude any mineral type.

### 5. Study Trade Balance Changes
This evaluation watches alterations in trade balance figures:
- **Trade Balance (-10.0 to -1.0):** Rule out Keynesian Economics.
- **Trade Balance (-1.0 to 1.0) and (1.0 to 10.0):** Does not exclude any mineral type.

### 6. Investigate Education Outcomes
Looking into the educational outcomes resulting from different economic theories:
- **Education Outcomes (50.0 to 100.0)%:** Rule out Keynesian Economics.
- **Education Outcomes (0.0 to 50.0)%:** Does not exclude any mineral type.

## Conclusion

In this guidebook, we have examined how various "mineral types"—related to economic theories—can be differentiated based on specific experimental outcomes. By utilizing this approach, we are able to rule out incompatible theories, thereby guiding us toward more substantiated understanding of their roles and implications within any given economic context. Through rigorous analysis and clear presentation, we hope to equip you with a robust methodology for exploring the dynamic interplay of economic thought.
