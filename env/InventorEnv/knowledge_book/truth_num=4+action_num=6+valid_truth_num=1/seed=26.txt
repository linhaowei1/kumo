# Guidebook to Identifying the True Inventor of a Prototype

When faced with determining the true inventor of an unverified prototype, following a structured, logical, and thorough investigative process is essential. This guidebook is designed to assist you in identifying the genuine creator from a list of suspected inventors, through various research actions and outcomes. Our specific focus is on the inventors Niels Bohr, Samuel Morse, Gertrude Belle Elion, and Nikola Tesla. Through a combination of multiple research techniques, we can systematically eliminate incorrect possibilities, narrowing down to the authentic inventor. 

## Inventors Overview

1. **Niels Bohr**: A Danish physicist known for his foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory.
   
2. **Samuel Morse**: An American painter and inventor, primarily known for developing the Morse code and contributing to the invention of the telegraph.
   
3. **Gertrude Belle Elion**: An American biochemist and pharmacologist, awarded a Nobel Prize for her innovations in drug development.
   
4. **Nikola Tesla**: A Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, and futurist celebrated for his pioneering work on alternating current (AC) electricity.

## Research Actions for Inventor Identification

To identify the true inventor, various research actions can be undertaken. Each action provides outcomes that can rule out specific inventors based on gathered data and historical context.

### 1. Biographical Study
A thorough examination of detailed biographies and historical records:

- **Detailed Biography**: No exclusions. This outcome doesn't rule out any inventor since detailed biographies are available.
- **Sparse Information**: Rules out **Gertrude Belle Elion**, indicating a lack of comprehensive historical information.

### 2. Carbon Dating
A technique used to date organic material associated with inventions, providing insight into which historical period the invention could belong to:

- **(0, 1500)**: Rules out everyone (**Nikola Tesla, Niels Bohr, Samuel Morse, Gertrude Belle Elion**), as none existed in this time frame.
- **(1501, 1900)**: Rules out **Niels Bohr**. This timeframe suggests an era corresponding to prior inventors' activities before his contributions.
- **(1901, 2023)**: Rules out **Samuel Morse**. This outcome is indicative of a more contemporary timeframe not associated with Morse’s active years.

### 3. Network Analysis
An exploration of the inventor's professional and collaborative networks:

- **Strong Network**: No exclusions. This result shows no weakness in continued credibility or influence.
- **Weak Network**: Rules out **Nikola Tesla**, often indicating his independent work and the lesser established collaborative networks during his time.

### 4. Expert Consultations
Discussions with historians, scientists or industry experts to gather opinions and consensus:

- **Consensus Achieved**: No exclusions. Shows potential agreement among experts without indicating any rule-outs.
- **No Consensus**: Rules out **Nikola Tesla**, potentially pointing to differing expert opinions or contentious identity claims.

### 5. Peer Review Analysis
Review of scholarly evaluations and critiques concerning the inventor's works and their impact:

- **Peer Approved**: No exclusions. Indicates broad acceptance without eliminating any inventor.
- **Peer Rejected**: Rules out **Nikola Tesla**, suggesting possible skepticism or disagreements among peers about Tesla's contributions being related to the prototype in question.

### 6. Cross-reference Citations
Analysis of how frequently and contextually works are cited in scholarly and historical documents:

- **Extensive Citations**: No exclusions. Implies the inventor’s works are well-referenced, showing relevance and credibility.
- **Few Citations**: Rules out **Nikola Tesla**, indicating limited recognition or lesser documentation relative to the specific query.

## Conclusion

Empirical results from these distinct research actions and their outcomes facilitate a process of elimination which can help verify an inventor’s claims over a prototype. By engaging in each approach decisively and attentively, it becomes clearer which historical figures can be ruled out, progressing towards identifying the true inventor of the prototype with greater conviction.

Following this investigative methodology ensures a comprehensive, clear, and structured process demonstrating the validity of historical accounts and attributions to particular inventors.
