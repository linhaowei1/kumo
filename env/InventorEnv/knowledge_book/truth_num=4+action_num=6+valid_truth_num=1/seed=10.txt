## Guidebook: Identifying the True Inventor of a Prototype

Determining the true inventor of a prototype can be an intricate process, requiring a careful examination of various factors and evidence. This guidebook is designed to help you systematically identify or rule out potential inventors using a combination of research actions and outcomes. 

### List of Inventors

Before delving into the research actions, it is important to familiarize yourself with the potential inventors:

1. **Alexander Graham Bell** - Known for inventing the telephone.
2. **Robert Noyce** - Co-inventor of the integrated circuit.
3. **Isaac Newton** - Renowned for his work in physics and mathematics, particularly the laws of motion and gravity.
4. **Mark Zuckerberg** - Co-founder of Facebook and a pivotal figure in social media development.

### Research Actions and Outcomes

The following research actions and their possible outcomes will guide you in ruling out certain inventors, thereby narrowing down the list:

#### 1. Carbon Dating

Carbon dating is a scientific method used to determine the age of materials.

- **Outcomes:**
  - If the dating falls between the years 0 and 1500, rule out: Alexander Graham Bell, Isaac Newton, Robert Noyce, and Mark Zuckerberg.
  - If the dating falls between the years 1501 and 1900, rule out: Robert Noyce and Mark Zuckerberg.
  - If the dating falls between the years 1901 and 2023, rule out: Isaac Newton.

#### 2. Data Mining

Data mining involves analyzing large datasets to identify patterns or extract information.

- **Outcomes:**
  - If the prototype context is data-rich, no inventors are ruled out.
  - If data is poor, rule out: Isaac Newton.

#### 3. Archival Research

Archival research entails examining historical records and documents.

- **Outcomes:**
  - If archival files are found, no inventors are ruled out.
  - If no records are available, rule out: Mark Zuckerberg.

#### 4. Code Decompilation

Code decompilation pertains to examining and breaking down software code to understand its structure and origin.

- **Outcomes:**
  - If code is found, rule out: Isaac Newton.
  - If no code is discovered, no inventors are ruled out.

#### 5. Financial Records Analysis

This research action involves assessing financial transactions and records related to the prototype.

- **Outcomes:**
  - If the financial value assessed is between $0 and $1,000,000, rule out: Mark Zuckerberg.
  - If the financial value is between $1,000,001 and $1,000,000,000, rule out: Isaac Newton.

#### 6. Document Authentication

This process checks the authenticity of documents pertaining to the invention.

- **Outcomes:**
  - If documents are authenticated, no inventors are ruled out.
  - If a forgery is detected, rule out: Mark Zuckerberg.

### Conclusion

By conducting these research actions and applying the outcomes to eliminate inventors, you can significantly narrow down the list of potential inventors for a given prototype. Remember, each outcome is an exclusion tool rather than a direct indicator of confirmation. This methodical process ensures a clear pathway to identifying the true inventor.
