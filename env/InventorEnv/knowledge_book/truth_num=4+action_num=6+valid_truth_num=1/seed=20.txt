# Guidebook: Identifying the True Inventor of a Prototype

In the quest to identify the true inventor of a prototype, it is crucial to analyze various research actions and interpret the corresponding outcomes to rule out certain inventors. This guidebook provides a comprehensive approach for using specific research methods to deduce the most likely inventor among four prominent figures: Nikola Tesla, Rosalind Franklin, Leonardo da Vinci, and Alexander Fleming.

### Inventors Overview

**1. Nikola Tesla:** Known for his pioneering work on electricity and electromagnetism, Tesla was a visionary inventor whose solo projects have often left a significant historical footprint.

**2. Rosalind Franklin:** A chemist whose contributions to the understanding of molecular structures were instrumental, particularly in the discovery of DNA.

**3. Leonardo da Vinci:** A polymath from the Renaissance, renowned for his inventions, artworks, and extensive note-taking that included numerous sketches and codes.

**4. Alexander Fleming:** Best known for discovering penicillin, Fleming had a strong network of scientific collaborations and contributions to medicine.

### Research Actions and Outcomes

**1. Network Analysis**
   - **Strong Network:** If a strong network is observed, Alexander Fleming is ruled out, due to his known collaborative nature.
   - **Weak Network:** Nikola Tesla is ruled out, indicating a lack of extensive collaboration.

**2. Collaboration Network Mapping**
   - **Collaborative Projects:** If collaborative projects are identified, none of the inventors can be ruled out, as this action mapped no such connections.
   - **Solo Projects:** Nikola Tesla is ruled out, reflecting his preference for working alone.

**3. Data Mining**
   - **Data Rich:** No inventors are excluded, indicating substantial available information.
   - **Data Poor:** Leonardo da Vinci is ruled out, suggesting a lack of digital data due to his historical context.

**4. Corporate Documents Review**
   - **Documents Found:** No inventors are excluded, as this implies documentation exists for the prototype.
   - **No Documents:** Leonardo da Vinci is ruled out, as the absence of corporate documentation implicates older timelines without formal records.

**5. Photographic Evidence Analysis**
   - **Photographs Found:** Leonardo da Vinci is ruled out, signifying lasting historical records only available in more recent decades.
   - **No Photographs:** No inventors are excluded, indicating no visual records are accessible.

**6. Code Decompilation**
   - **Code Found:** Leonardo da Vinci is ruled out due to the technological gap of his time.
   - **No Code:** No inventors are excluded, suggesting the lack of code does not implicate anyone definitively.

### Applying the Research Actions

To accurately identify the true inventor, apply each research action and observe the outcomes diligently. Use the provided exclusion criteria to eliminate inventors who are inconsistent with the research findings. By systematically engaging with each process, the set of possible inventors will narrow down, leading to the identification of the true inventor.

### Conclusion

This guide serves as a roadmap for conducting a thorough investigation into the origins of a prototype. By understanding and applying the research actions, leveraging their outcomes, and diligently ruling out possibilities, you ensure that the true inventor surfaces through logical deduction and a robust analytical framework.
