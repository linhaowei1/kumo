## Guidebook on Identifying the True Inventor of a Prototype

Finding the true inventor of a prototype is a sophisticated process that involves thorough research and scientific inquiry. The process includes identifying and ruling out potential candidates using a variety of investigative methods. This guidebook aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the inventors under consideration, the methods to investigate their involvement, and the interpretation of outcomes to exclude certain inventors.

### Inventors

**1. Albert Einstein**
Albert Einstein is renowned for his contributions to theoretical physics, especially the theory of relativity. His involvement in prototype inventions might be manifested through innovations that imbue a deep scientific understanding.

**2. Elon Musk**
An entrepreneur and industrial designer, Elon Musk is known for advancing technology in diverse fields, notably space exploration and electric vehicles. However, his prototypes might show traces of contemporary and futuristic design.

**3. Nikola Tesla**
Nikola Tesla is celebrated for his pioneering work in electricity and electromagnetism. His prototypes often reflect ingenious electrical engineering feats and novel technology from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

**4. Grace Hopper**
A pioneering computer scientist, Grace Hopper made significant advancements in computer programming. A prototype attributed to her would potentially feature early computational technologies and collaborative developments in computing.

### Research Actions

#### 1. Material Composition Test
This test helps determine the materials used in constructing the prototype. The results lead to the exclusion of potential inventors:
- **0 to 50% Composition**: Nikola Tesla is ruled out.
- **51 to 100% Composition**: Albert Einstein is ruled out.

#### 2. Market Impact Study
This study evaluates the prototype's impact on the market upon or after release:
- **High Impact**: No inventors are conclusively ruled out based solely on high impact, requiring further investigation.
- **Low Impact**: Elon Musk is ruled out.

#### 3. Collaboration Network Mapping
Identifies whether the prototype was developed through collaboration or as a solo project:
- **Collaborative Projects**: Grace Hopper is ruled out.
- **Solo Projects**: Nikola Tesla is ruled out.

#### 4. Technological Analysis
Assesses the level of technological advancement within the prototype:
- **Advanced Technology**: No inventors are directly ruled out by advanced technology alone.
- **Primitive Technology**: Elon Musk is ruled out.

#### 5. Carbon Dating
Determines the time period during which the prototype was created:
- **0 to 1500**: All inventors (Albert Einstein, Grace Hopper, Elon Musk, Nikola Tesla) are ruled out.
- **1501 to 1900**: Grace Hopper and Elon Musk are ruled out.
- **1901 to 2023**: No inventors are directly ruled out by this time range.

#### 6. Archival Research
Involves searching historical records and documents related to the prototype:
- **Files Found**: No inventors are ruled out by simply finding files.
- **No Records**: Elon Musk is ruled out.

### Application of Research Outcomes to Determine the Inventor

Applying these research methods correctly involves observing specific outcomes and systematically ruling out inventors, as per the links between outcomes and exclusions:

- A prototype with a **Material Composition Test** result of 0 to 50% excludes Nikola Tesla.
- **Low Impact Market Study** suggests ruling out Elon Musk.
- **Collaboration Network Mapping** excludes Grace Hopper for collaborative projects, and Nikola Tesla for solo projects.
- **Primitive Technology Analysis** results in ruling out Elon Musk.
- Prototypes dated to the period **1501 to 1900** eliminate possibilities of Grace Hopper and Elon Musk.
- Lack of **Archival Records** excludes Elon Musk further, refining the investigatory focus.

This comprehensive investigation helps in navigating towards the true inventor by systematically applying methods, analyzing outcomes, and ruling out possibilities, ensuring a clear and logical conclusion to the investigation.
