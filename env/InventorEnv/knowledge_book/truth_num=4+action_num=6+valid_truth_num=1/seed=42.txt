# Guidebook on Identifying the True Inventor of a Prototype

The process of identifying the true inventor of a certain prototype involves a structured investigation using various research actions. This guidebook outlines the steps for utilizing these actions effectively, highlighting key inventors and the circumstances under which they can be ruled out from being the true inventor based on the observed outcomes.

## Inventors Considered

This study focuses on four potential inventors:

1. **Albert Einstein**: Known for his contributions to the theory of relativity and theoretical physics.
2. **Nikolaus Otto**: Innovator credited with creating the internal combustion engine.
3. **Nikola Tesla**: Renowned for developing alternating current (AC) electrical systems.
4. **Sergey Brin**: Co-founder of Google and known for his work in technology and internet innovations.

## Research Actions and Outcomes

The following research actions help identify or rule out the inventors based on the specific outcomes observed:

### 1. Competitor Analysis

This analysis looks at the competitive landscape during the development of the prototype:

- **Many Competitors**: If this state is observed, eliminate **Sergey Brin** as the inventor.
- **Few Competitors**: No inventor is ruled out.

### 2. Peer Review Analysis

This involves examining peer reviews and validations:

- **Peer Approved**: No inventors are ruled out through this outcome.
- **Peer Rejected**: If this state is observed, exclude **Nikola Tesla** and **Albert Einstein**.

### 3. Collaboration Network Mapping

This process maps out the collaborative efforts surrounding the prototype's creation:

- **Collaborative Projects**: No inventors are ruled out.
- **Solo Projects**: If the project was completed solo, exclude **Nikola Tesla**.

### 4. Laboratory Experiments Replication

This involves replicating the laboratory experiments related to the prototype:

- **Successful Replication**: No inventors are ruled out.
- **Failed Replication**: Eliminate **Nikola Tesla** if replication of the experiment fails.

### 5. AI Simulation

Simulations are used to predict and evaluate potential outcomes of the prototype:

- **Simulations between 0.0 and 0.5**: No inventors are ruled out.
- **Simulations between 0.5 and 1.0**: Rule out **Sergey Brin** if this outcome is observed.

### 6. Material Composition Test

This test analyzes the materials used in the prototype:

- **Material Composition between 0 and 50**: Eliminate **Nikola Tesla**.
- **Material Composition between 51 and 100**: Rule out **Albert Einstein**.

## Summary of Rule-Out Criteria

Each research action can result in outcomes that lead to the exclusion of certain inventors. By following these guidelines, we systematically narrow down the possibilities, making it easier to identify the true inventor.

### Exclusion Quick Reference:
- **Sergey Brin** can be ruled out in the scenarios involving "Many Competitors" and "AI Simulations between 0.5 and 1.0".
- **Albert Einstein** is excluded based on "Peer Rejected" outcomes and "Material Composition between 51 and 100".
- **Nikola Tesla** is eliminated if:
  - "Peer Rejected", 
  - "Solo Projects", 
  - "Failed Replication", or 
  - "Material Composition between 0 and 50".

By following these methods and observing the outcomes accurately, the elimination process ensures the identification of the correct inventor while providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the research methods and inventor relationships.
