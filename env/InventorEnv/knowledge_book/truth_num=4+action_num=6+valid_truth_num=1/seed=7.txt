# Guidebook: Identifying the True Inventor of a Prototype

In the pursuit of uncovering the authentic creator of a particular prototype, it becomes imperative to consider the rich historical context and apply a structured research methodology. This guidebook provides a detailed approach to identifying the true inventor by examining four notable figures from history and employing a regiment of analytical techniques to distinguish among them.

## Notable Inventors

1. **Leonardo da Vinci**: A polymath from the Renaissance period, known for his inventive genius and contribution to various fields of art and science.
   
2. **Gordon Moore**: Co-founder of Intel and a pioneer in technology, recognized for Moore's Law—the observation that the number of transistors on microchips doubles approximately every two years.
   
3. **Alexander Fleming**: A Scottish bacteriologist and pharmacologist, credited with discovering penicillin.
   
4. **Hedy Lamarr**: An Austrian-American actress and inventor, celebrated for her work in developing a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes during World War II.

## Research Actions and Their Implementation

To identify the true inventor of a prototype, a series of investigative research actions need to be executed, each of which operates on eliminating possibilities rather than confirming them. Here’s how:

### 1. Carbon Dating

Carbon dating is a process used to determine the age of an artifact. It can provide insight into when the prototype was likely first developed.

- **Outcomes**:
  - If the date range is between the year 0 and 1500, then **Alexander Fleming**, **Hedy Lamarr**, and **Gordon Moore** are ruled out. 
  - If the range falls between 1501 and 1900, **Gordon Moore** is excluded from consideration.
  - For dates between 1901 and 2023, **Leonardo da Vinci** must be ruled out.

### 2. Technological Analysis

This involves assessing the level of sophistication of the prototype's technology.

- **Outcomes**:
  - If it's found to be "Advanced Technology", it eliminates **Leonardo da Vinci** from the list.
  - "Primitive Technology" does not automatically exclude any specific inventor.

### 3. Data Mining

This process involves extracting information from various data sources to understand historical records associated with the prototype.

- **Outcomes**:
  - If the data is "Data Rich", no inventors are ruled out, indicating the presence of extensive supporting data.
  - If the data is "Data Poor", it excludes **Leonardo da Vinci**.

### 4. Financial Records Analysis

Analyzing financial expenditures and investments related to the prototype development to trace its history and origin.

- **Outcomes**:
  - If financial records indicate an expenditure between 0 and 1,000,000, no inventors are excluded.
  - For expenditures between 1,000,001 and 1,000,000,000, **Leonardo da Vinci** is ruled out.

### 5. Patent Searches

Investigating available patents related to the prototype can provide clues about its origin.

- **Outcomes**:
  - If patents are found, no inventors are ruled out.
  - If no patents are identified, this excludes **Leonardo da Vinci**.

### 6. Device Forensics

This involves examining the physical and technical characteristics of the prototype for clues regarding its origin.

- **Outcomes**:
  - The presence of digital components rules out **Leonardo da Vinci**.
  - The presence of mechanical components does not exclude any inventor immediately.

## Conclusion

By meticulously applying these research actions and analyzing their outcomes, investigators can effectively narrow down the list of potential inventors by eliminating candidates based on evidence rather than confirming a specific individual. This systemic elimination strategy ensures a more accurate identification of the actual inventor responsible for the prototype in question.
