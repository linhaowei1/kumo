# Guidebook for Identifying the True Inventor of a Prototype

Identifying the true inventor of a specific prototype requires a methodical approach involving reviewing publications, consulting experts, accessing government archives, cross-referencing citations, conducting peer review analyses, and searching for patents. Here, we detail how these activities can help eliminate certain inventors from consideration, ultimately narrowing down the list of potential candidates to find the real inventor.

## Inventors Under Consideration

Our investigation centers on the following renowned inventors:

- **Gordon Moore**: Known for Moore's Law and contributions to semiconductor technology.
- **Alan Turing**: A pivotal figure in the development of computer science and artificial intelligence.
- **Albert Einstein**: Renowned for the theory of relativity and his contributions to physics.
- **Tim Berners-Lee**: The inventor of the World Wide Web.

## Research Actions

To accurately determine the provenance of the prototype, we examine various state outcomes as part of our investigative procedures:

### 1. Publication Reviews

By conducting a thorough examination of publications, we aim to identify whether the prototype can be linked to the focal research of any inventor.

- **Outcome: Extensive Publications**  
  - Rule Out: **Alan Turing**. If extensive publications are found, Alan Turing is ruled out.

- **Outcome: Limited Publications**  
  - Rule Out: No inventors are eliminated if only limited publications are related.

### 2. Expert Consultations

Engaging with experts in the relevant field allows for a collective assessment of the invention's origins.

- **Outcome: Consensus Achieved**  
  - Rule Out: No inventors are excluded if consensus on the inventor is achieved. 

- **Outcome: No Consensus**  
  - Rule Out: **Albert Einstein**. If there is no consensus, Albert Einstein is ruled out.

### 3. Government Archive Access

Delving into government archives may reveal official records of the invention process or original patent submissions.

- **Outcome: Archives Found**  
  - Rule Out: No inventors are ruled out when archives are successfully accessed. 

- **Outcome: No Archives**  
  - Rule Out: **Tim Berners-Lee**. If no archives are found, Tim Berners-Lee is ruled out.

### 4. Cross-reference Citations

Observing the frequency and context of citations can help determine the impact and origin of the prototype.

- **Outcome: Extensive Citations**  
  - Rule Out: **Albert Einstein**. If extensive citations are found, Albert Einstein is ruled out.

- **Outcome: Few Citations**  
  - Rule Out: No inventors are eliminated based on limited citations.

### 5. Peer Review Analysis

Peer-reviewed analyses by other experts can affirm or discredit claims regarding the prototype's origin.

- **Outcome: Peer Approved**  
  - Rule Out: No inventors are ruled out if peer approval is achieved. 

- **Outcome: Peer Rejected**  
  - Rule Out: **Albert Einstein**. If the prototype's claims are peer rejected, Albert Einstein is ruled out.

### 6. Patent Searches

Searching for patents can be definitive evidence of an inventor's claim to the prototype.

- **Outcome: Patents Found**  
  - Rule Out: No inventors are ruled out if patents are identified.

- **Outcome: No Patents**  
  - Rule Out: **Albert Einstein**. If no patents are found, Albert Einstein is ruled out.

By systematically applying the above research actions and observing the respective outcomes, we can effectively reduce the list of potential inventors, ultimately identifying the true inventor of the prototype. Each step serves to exclude candidates not aligning with the observed evidence, guiding us closer to a reliable conclusion.
