# Guidebook to Identifying the True Inventor of a Prototype

Embarking on the quest to identify the true inventor of a prototype requires methodical research and analysis. In this guidebook, we'll navigate through various research actions to discern which inventor truly lays claim to the creation at hand. The inventors of interest are Tim Berners-Lee, Isaac Newton, Samuel Morse, and Werner Heisenberg. We'll explore each available research action, outline their potential outcomes, and define how these outcomes can eliminate certain inventors from consideration.

## Inventors Overview

1. **Tim Berners-Lee**: Known for inventing the World Wide Web, with his work largely emerging in the late 20th century.
2. **Isaac Newton**: A renowned 17th-century scientist, famed for his laws of motion and gravitation.
3. **Samuel Morse**: Recognized in the 19th century for inventing the Morse code and contributions to telegraphy.
4. **Werner Heisenberg**: A pivotal figure in 20th-century physics, famous for developing the Uncertainty Principle.

## Research Actions and Outcomes

To accurately identify the true inventor, various research actions can be employed. Here, we define each action, possible outcomes, and corresponding rule-out for inventors.

### 1. Carbon Dating

Carbon dating helps determine the age of a prototype and can provide chronological insights.

- **Outcome Rule:**
  - If the prototype dates back to between 0 - 1500:
    - **Isaac Newton, Tim Berners-Lee, Werner Heisenberg, Samuel Morse** are all ruled out.
  - If it falls between 1501 - 1900:
    - **Werner Heisenberg** is ruled out.
  - If it dates between 1901 - 2023:
    - **Isaac Newton, Samuel Morse** are ruled out.

### 2. Government Archive Access

Consulting government archives can uncover official records related to the prototype.

- **Outcome Rule:**
  - If archives are found, no specific inventors are ruled out purely based on archive presence.
  - If no archives exist:
    - **Tim Berners-Lee** is ruled out.

### 3. Patent Searches

Patent records can confirm legal claims over the invention.

- **Outcome Rule:**
  - If patents are found, no specific inventors are ruled out merely due to patent presence.
  - If no patents exist:
    - **Isaac Newton** is ruled out.

### 4. Linguistic Analysis

This involves analyzing the language style and structure associated with the prototype.

- **Outcome Rule:**
  - If the language is modern:
    - **Isaac Newton** is ruled out.
  - If the language is ancient, no inventors are directly ruled out by this analysis.

### 5. Photographic Evidence Analysis

Analyzing photographic evidence can offer visual proof of association with the prototype.

- **Outcome Rule:**
  - If photographs are found:
    - **Isaac Newton** is ruled out.
  - No specific rule-out if no photographs are present.

### 6. Social Media Analysis

While perhaps less traditional, checking the inventors' presence or discussions around a prototype on social media can be insightful.

- **Outcome Rule:**
  - If an active presence is noted, no inventors are ruled out.
  - If no presence is found:
    - **Isaac Newton** is ruled out.

## Conclusion

By methodically conducting each research action and applying these rule-out strategies, you can narrow down the list of possible inventors for the prototype under investigation. Each action and outcome offers a unique lens through which the historical context and claims over the invention can be examined, ensuring that your conclusion rests on a robust and comprehensive foundation.
