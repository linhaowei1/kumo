# Guide to Identifying the True Inventor of a Prototype

This guide provides a systematic framework for identifying the true inventor of a prototype by analyzing available data through various research actions. Below is a breakdown of key inventors, research actions, and outcomes that help in determining who can be ruled out as a potential inventor based on the results of each analysis.

## Inventors

- **Johannes Gutenberg**: Known for his contribution to the printing technology revolution, specifically the introduction of the movable type printing press.
- **Ernst Ruska**: Credited with the development of the electron microscope, revolutionizing the field of microscopy.
- **Alexander Graham Bell**: Famous for inventing the first practical telephone, changing the way we communicate.
- **Wilbur Wright**: Along with his brother Orville, credited with inventing and building the worldâ€™s first successful airplane, contributing significantly to aeronautics.

## Research Actions and Outcomes

### 1. Carbon Dating
This method estimates the age of an object by measuring the isotopic decay, particularly useful in categorizing historical timelines.

- **Time Period (0, 1500):**
  - Ruling Out: Alexander Graham Bell, Ernst Ruska, Wilbur Wright
  
- **Time Period (1501, 1900):**
  - No inventors are ruled out based on this period.

- **Time Period (1901, 2023):**
  - Ruling Out: Johannes Gutenberg

### 2. Technological Analysis
Assessment of the complexity and advancement of the technology used in the prototype to determine its likely inventor.

- **Advanced Technology:**
  - Ruling Out: Johannes Gutenberg
  
- **Primitive Technology:**
  - No inventors are ruled out based on this finding.

### 3. Legal Records Examination
Evaluating patents, lawsuits, and other legal documents related to the prototype might offer clues or eliminate certain inventors.

- **No Legal Issues:**
  - No inventors are ruled out in this scenario.
  
- **Legal Disputes Found:**
  - Similarly, no inventors are automatically ruled out here, implying all may still be possible claimants.

### 4. Interview Witnesses
Collecting verbal accounts related to the creation or demonstration of the prototype.

- **Witnesses Available:**
  - No inventors are eliminated based on witness accounts.
  
- **No Witnesses:**
  - Similar to the presence of witnesses, the absence doesn't directly eliminate any inventor.

### 5. Document Authentication
Scrutinizing documents for authenticity can differentiate between legitimate information and forgeries.

- **Authentic:**
  - No inventors are excluded by authenticity.
  
- **Forgery Detected:**
  - Again, no inventors are ruled out purely on forgery detection, necessitating further analysis.

### 6. Reverse Engineering
Disassembling the prototype to understand its construction and the sophistication behind it.

- **Complex Mechanisms:**
  - No inventors are eliminated, suggesting the complexity might still relate to any inventor.

- **Simple Mechanisms:**
  - Likewise, the simplicity of mechanisms does not rule out any individual inventor in this analysis.

## Conclusion
By systematically applying these research actions and evaluating outcomes, you can narrow down the list of potential inventors for a particular prototype. The outcomes from each method help exclude certain individuals based on historical, technological, or documented insights, thus guiding you closer to identifying the true inventor.
