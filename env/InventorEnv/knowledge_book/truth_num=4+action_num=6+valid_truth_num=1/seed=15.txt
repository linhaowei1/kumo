# Guidebook for Identifying the True Inventor of a Prototype

When attempting to identify the true inventor of a particular prototype, a systematic approach involving various research actions must be undertaken. This guide will help you navigate through these processes and assess the possible inventors: Eli Whitney, Thomas Edison, Robert Noyce, and Richard Feynman. Each research method provides critical insights that help rule out certain inventors under specific outcomes, thereby narrowing down the potential candidates.

## Understanding the Inventors

### Eli Whitney
Best known for inventing the cotton gin, Eli Whitney was an American inventor crucial to the development of industrial manufacturing techniques. His timeline of activity primarily pre-dates the 20th century.

### Thomas Edison
A prolific inventor, Edison held over 1,000 patents, including the phonograph and the electric light bulb. He was known for both his collaborations and solo efforts, heavily involved from the late 19th to early 20th century.

### Robert Noyce
Regarded as a key figure in the semiconductor industry, Robert Noyce co-founded Intel and was instrumental in the development of the integrated circuit, prominent in the mid-to-late 20th century.

### Richard Feynman
A theoretical physicist known for his work in quantum mechanics and the development of the atomic bomb, Richard Feynman made substantial contributions to technology and science in the mid-20th century.

## Research Actions and Outcomes

The following research actions help rule out inventors based on specific outcomes. Carefully consider the state and associated exclusions.

### 1. Reverse Engineering
By analyzing the complexity of the prototype's mechanisms, this method can provide insights into its origins.

- **Simple Mechanisms**: Rule out Thomas Edison.

### 2. Carbon Dating
Carbon dating the materials can indicate the time period the prototype belongs to.

- **Dates between 0 and 1500**: Rule out Thomas Edison, Robert Noyce, Eli Whitney, and Richard Feynman.
- **Dates between 1501 and 1900**: Rule out Robert Noyce and Richard Feynman.
- **Dates between 1901 and 2023**: Rule out Eli Whitney.

### 3. Material Composition Test
Examining the materials used in the prototype can provide clues about its creator based on known resources and technologies of their time.

- **Materials dated 0 to 50**: Rule out Thomas Edison.
- **Materials dated 51 to 100**: No inventors are conclusively ruled out.

### 4. Collaboration Network Mapping
Investigating the nature of project collaborations can highlight inventors' preferred working styles.

- **Collaborative Projects**: No inventors are conclusively ruled out.
- **Solo Projects**: Rule out Thomas Edison.

### 5. Witness Testimonies
The feedback from contemporaries or direct witnesses can provide subjective insights into the inventors' roles.

- **Positive Feedback**: No inventors are conclusively ruled out.
- **Negative Feedback**: Rule out Thomas Edison.

### 6. Cross-reference Citations
Analyzing how extensively an inventor's work is cited can suggest their involvement in a prototype's development.

- **Extensive Citations**: No inventors are conclusively ruled out.
- **Few Citations**: Rule out Thomas Edison.

## Conclusion

By leveraging each research action's specific outcomes and associated exclusions, you can systematically eliminate inventors from consideration, honing in on the true inventor of the prototype. This structured process ensures that every piece of available evidence is used to narrow down the list of potential candidates, bringing you closer to an accurate identification.
