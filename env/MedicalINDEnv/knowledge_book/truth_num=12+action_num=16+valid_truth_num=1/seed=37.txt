   - **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**:
     - **Rule Out**: A CRP level between 0 and 5 may help rule out SLE.
   - **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**:
     - **Rule Out**: An ESR between 0 and 20 may also rule out SLE.
   - **Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) Test**:
     - **Rule Out**: A negative ANA test helps exclude SLE.

3. **HIV/AIDS**
   - **HIV Antibody Test**:
     - **Rule Out**: A negative result rules out HIV/AIDS.

4. **Bipolar Disorder**
   - **Depression Screening Questionnaire**:
     - **Rule Out**: A negative result rules out bipolar disorder.
   - **Anxiety Screening Questionnaire**:
     - **Rule Out**: A negative result rules out bipolar disorder.

5. **Coronary Artery Disease**
   - **Lipid Profile**:
     - **Rule Out**: A normal lipid profile may help rule out coronary artery disease.

6. **Pre-Diabetes**
   - **HbA1c Test**:
     - **Rule Out**: HbA1c levels between 0.0 and 5.6 exclude pre-diabetes.
   - **Blood Glucose Test**:
     - **Rule Out**: Blood glucose levels between 0 to 99 help rule out pre-diabetes.

7. **Viral Infection**
   - **Blood Culture**:
     - **Rule Out**: No bacterial growth helps rule out a viral infection.
   - **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:
     - **Rule Out**: A normal CBC can help rule out a viral infection.
   - **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**:
     - **Rule Out**: CRP levels between 0 and 5 may help exclude viral infection.
   - **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**:
     - **Rule Out**: ESR values between 0 and 20 may help rule out viral infections.

8. **Stable Angina**
   - **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**:
     - **Rule Out**: A normal ECG result rules out stable angina.

9. **COVID-19**
   - **COVID-19 PCR Test**:
     - **Rule Out**: A negative result can help exclude COVID-19.

10. **Diabetes Mellitus Type 1**
     - **HbA1c Test**:
       - **Rule Out**: HbA1c levels between 0.0 and 5.6 rule out diabetes mellitus type 1.
     - **Blood Glucose Test**:
       - **Rule Out**: Blood glucose levels between 0 and 99 rule out diabetes mellitus type 1.

11. **Leukemia**
    - **Peripheral Blood Smear**:
      - **Rule Out**: A normal, microcytic_hypochromic, macrocytic, or sickle_cells result may exclude leukemia.
    - **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:
      - **Rule Out**: A normal CBC may help exclude leukemia.

12. **Metabolic Syndrome**
    - **HbA1c Test**:
      - **Rule Out**: HbA1c levels between 0.0 and 5.6 can rule out metabolic syndrome.
    - **Blood Glucose Test**:
      - **Rule Out**: Blood glucose levels between 0 and 99 help rule out metabolic syndrome.
    - **Lipid Profile**:
      - **Rule Out**: A normal lipid profile may exclude metabolic syndrome.
