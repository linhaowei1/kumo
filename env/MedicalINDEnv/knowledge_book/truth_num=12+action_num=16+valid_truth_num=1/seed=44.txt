# Medical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook is designed to provide a clear understanding of certain diseases and the diagnostic tests used to help differentiate them. The focus is on identifying which diseases can be ruled out based on specific test outcomes. Understanding these relationships is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management of patient health.

### Diseases Overview
1. **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2**: A chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels due to insulin resistance.
2. **Aortic Stenosis**: A condition where the heart's aortic valve narrows, affecting blood flow from the heart.
3. **Osteoporosis**: A disease that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break.
4. **Folate Deficiency Anemia**: A type of anemia caused by a lack of folic acid in the diet, leading to insufficient red blood cells.
5. **Sepsis**: A life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to infection, leading to organ dysfunction.
6. **Arrhythmia**: An irregular heartbeat, which can lead to various heart complications.
7. **Unstable Angina**: A condition characterized by unexpected chest pain, indicating a higher risk of heart attack.
8. **Viral Infection**: Diseases caused by viruses, commonly leading to infections like the flu or common cold.
9. **Bacterial Infection**: Infections caused by bacteria, treatable by antibiotics.
10. **Pre-Diabetes**: A condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough for a diabetes diagnosis.
11. **Anxiety Disorder**: A mental health disorder characterized by feelings of worry and fear.
12. **Stable Angina**: Predictable chest pain or discomfort often triggered by physical activity or stress.
