## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive guidebook that aims to provide insights into some significant diseases and the diagnostic tests employed to rule out possible conditions. Understanding how different tests help exclude certain diseases is crucial in medical diagnostics. Herein, we discuss several diseases and the relevant tests, focusing on what each test result implies regarding the exclusion of specific diseases.

## Diseases and Diagnostic Tests

### 1. Bacterial Infection

- **Blood Culture Test**: If the test shows "no growth," a bacterial infection can be ruled out.

- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**: A CRP level between 0 and 5 mg/L helps rule out a bacterial infection.

### 2. Pre-Diabetes

- **Blood Glucose Test**: Blood glucose levels ranging from 0 to 99 mg/dL exclude Pre-Diabetes.

- **HbA1c Test**: An HbA1c level between 0.0% and 5.6% rules out Pre-Diabetes. Levels from 6.5% to 15.0% can also eliminate this condition.

### 3. Folate Deficiency Anemia

- **Peripheral Blood Smear**: Observing "normal" or "blast cells" can exclude Folate Deficiency Anemia.

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: A "normal" CBC rules out Folate Deficiency Anemia.

### 4. HIV/AIDS

- **HIV Antibody Test**: A "negative" result will exclude HIV/AIDS.

### 5. Anemia of Chronic Disease

- **Peripheral Blood Smear**: The presence of "microcytic hypochromic" or "blast cells" can rule out Anemia of Chronic Disease.

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: A "normal" CBC result rules this condition out.

### 6. Leukemia

- **Peripheral Blood Smear**: If the smear is "normal," Leukemia is unlikely.
  
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: A "normal" CBC result can exclude Leukemia.

### 7. Myocardial Infarction

- **Troponin Levels**: "Normal" troponin levels rule out Myocardial Infarction.

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: A "normal" ECG rules out Myocardial Infarction.

### 8. Arrhythmia

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: A "normal" ECG excludes Arrhythmia as a diagnosis.

### 9. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2

- **Blood Glucose Test**: Levels between 0 and 99 mg/dL can rule out Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.

- **HbA1c Test**: An HbA1c level between 0.0% and 5.6% excludes this type of diabetes.

### 10. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

- **Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) Test**: A "negative" result rules out SLE.

- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**: Levels between 0 and 5 mg/L exclude this condition.

### 11. Diabetes Mellitus Type 1

- **Blood Glucose Test**: Ranges between 0 and 99 mg/dL rule out this type of diabetes.

- **HbA1c Test**: Levels from 0.0% to 5.6% can eliminate Diabetes Mellitus Type 1.

### 12. Bipolar Disorder

- **Depression Screening Questionnaire**: A "negative" result excludes Bipolar Disorder.

- **Anxiety Screening Questionnaire**: A "negative" result rules out Bipolar Disorder.
