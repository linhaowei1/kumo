This guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of specific diseases, corresponding diagnostic tests, and how the outcomes of these tests help in ruling out possible conditions. Understanding these relationships is essential for health professionals to make informed diagnostic decisions.

## Diseases Overview

### Anxiety Disorder
A mental health disorder characterized by feelings of worry, anxiety, or fear that are strong enough to interfere with one's daily activities.

### Iron Deficiency Anemia
A common type of anemia arising from insufficient iron, leading to reduced production of hemoglobin and affecting oxygen transport in the blood.

### Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
A chronic digestive condition where stomach acid or bile irritates the food pipe lining, often causing heartburn.

### Aortic Stenosis
A condition where the aortic valve narrows, reducing or blocking blood flow from the heart into the aorta and onward to the body.

### Pre-Diabetes
A condition characterized by slightly elevated blood sugar levels, indicating a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

### Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia
An anemia type due to insufficient vitamin B12, essential for red blood cell production and neurological function.

### Osteoporosis
A bone disease that occurs when the body loses too much bone or makes too little bone, leading to fragility.

### COVID-19
An infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, leading to respiratory illness and potentially severe complications.

### Folate Deficiency Anemia
A reduction in red blood cells caused by inadequate folate, essential for DNA synthesis and cell division.

### Bacterial Infection
Infections caused by bacteria, which can result in a range of conditions from mild to severe.

### Arrhythmia
An irregular heartbeat that can be too fast, too slow, or erratic.

### Peptic Ulcer Disease
A condition where open sores develop on the inside lining of the stomach and the upper portion of the small intestine.
