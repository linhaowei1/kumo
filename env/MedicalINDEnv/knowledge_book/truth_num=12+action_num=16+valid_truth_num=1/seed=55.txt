Each diagnostic test provides critical information, not necessarily to confirm a specific disease's presence but to effectively rule out conditions that might present similar symptoms. Accurate exclusion of certain diseases helps healthcare providers focus on viable conditions and tailor treatment plans more effectively. Use this guide to understand and interpret the outcomes of various tests, ensuring informed clinical decisions.
