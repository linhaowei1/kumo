# Medical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of several medical conditions and the diagnostic tests commonly used to evaluate them. For each test outcome, specific diseases are "ruled out," meaning they are excluded from being potential diagnoses based on the observed outcome.

## Diseases Overview

**1. Iron Deficiency Anemia:** This condition is characterized by a lack of enough healthy red blood cells due to insufficient iron, leading to fatigue and weakness.

**2. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:** A chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose), leading to elevated blood sugar levels.

**3. Aortic Stenosis:** A narrowing of the aortic valve opening, restricting blood flow from the heart.

**4. Osteoporosis:** A condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break.

**5. Unstable Angina:** A type of chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart, signifying a risk of heart attack.

**6. Bacterial Infection:** An infection caused by bacteria, resulting in a range of symptoms based on the area of infection.

**7. Fungal Infection:** Caused by fungi, leading to various symptoms similar to those of bacterial infections.

**8. Anemia of Chronic Disease:** A type of anemia often seen in people with chronic illnesses or inflammation, affecting red blood cell production.

**9. Heart Failure:** A chronic condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue.

**10. Viral Infection:** Infection caused by a virus, which can affect various parts of the body.

**11. Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia:** Occurs when there's a lack of vitamin B12, leading to fewer red blood cells and various neurological issues.

**12. HIV/AIDS:** A virus that attacks the immune system, leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) if left untreated.
