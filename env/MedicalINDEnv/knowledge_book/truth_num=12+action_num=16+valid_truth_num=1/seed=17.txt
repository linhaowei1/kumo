## Introduction
This guidebook aims to introduce a set of diseases and their related diagnostic tests. It provides an understanding of how specific test outcomes can help rule out certain diseases. By interpreting these outcomes correctly, healthcare professionals can make informed decisions in diagnosing and ruling out potential conditions.

## Diseases

1. **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2**: A chronic condition affecting the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). Typically seen in adults, it is associated with obesity and lifestyle factors.

2. **Coronary Artery Disease**: A disease characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, usually due to atherosclerosis, resulting in reduced blood flow to the heart.

3. **Pre-Diabetes**: A state where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough to be classified as diabetes. It indicates an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

4. **Peptic Ulcer Disease**: A condition where open sores develop on the inner lining of the stomach or the upper part of the small intestine, often caused by H. pylori infection or prolonged use of NSAIDs.

5. **Diabetes Mellitus Type 1**: An autoimmune condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin. It often manifests in childhood or adolescence.

6. **Unstable Angina**: A type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It does not follow a predictable pattern and occurs even at rest.

7. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia**: Anemia resulting from insufficient vitamin B12, which is crucial for red blood cell formation and neurological function.

8. **Folate Deficiency Anemia**: Anemia caused by a deficiency of folate (vitamin B9), essential for DNA synthesis and cell division.

9. **Fungal Infection**: Infections caused by fungi that can affect various parts of the body, skin, or internal organs.

10. **Osteoporosis**: A bone disease that occurs when the body loses too much bone, makes too little bone, or both, making bones weak and more likely to break.

11. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**: An autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body.

12. **Heart Failure**: A condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

## Diagnostic Tests and Analysis

- **Range: 5.7-6.4%**: Rule out Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and Diabetes Mellitus Type 1.
- **Range: 6.5-15.0%**: Pre-Diabetes can be ruled out.

### 4. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)
- **Range: 0-20 mm/hr**: Rule out Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Fungal Infection.
- **Range: 21-100 mm/hr**: No specific exclusions.

### 5. Echocardiogram

- **Reduced Ejection Fraction, Valve Abnormalities, Hypertrophy**: No specific exclusions.

### 6. Upper Endoscopy
- **Normal**: Peptic Ulcer Disease can be ruled out.
- **Esophagitis, Gastric Ulcer, Duodenal Ulcer**: No specific exclusions.

### 7. Bone Mineral Density Test
- **Range: -4.0 to -2.5 SD**: Does not rule out any specific conditions.
- **Range: -2.5 to -1.0 SD and -1.0 to 4.0 SD**: Rule out Osteoporosis.

### 8. Troponin Levels
- **Normal**: Unstable Angina can be ruled out.
- **Elevated**: No specific exclusions.

### 9. Peripheral Blood Smear
- **Normal**: Rule out Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia and Folate Deficiency Anemia.
- **Microcytic Hypochromic**: Rule out Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia and Folate Deficiency Anemia.
- **Macrocytic**: Does not rule out any specific conditions.
- **Sickle Cells**: Rule out Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia and Folate Deficiency Anemia.
- **Blast Cells**: Rule out Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia and Folate Deficiency Anemia.

### 10. C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
- **Range: 0-5 mg/L**: Rule out Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Fungal Infection.
- **Range: 6-200 mg/L**: No specific exclusions.

### 11. Blood Culture
- **No Growth**: Fungal Infection is unlikely.
- **Bacterial Growth**: No specific exclusions.

### 12. Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) Test
- **Positive**: No specific exclusions.
- **Negative**: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) can be ruled out.

### 13. Lipid Profile
- **Normal**: Coronary Artery Disease is unlikely.
- **Elevated Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Low HDL**: No specific exclusions.

### 14. Complete Blood Count (CBC)
- **Normal**: Rule out Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia, Folate Deficiency Anemia, and Fungal Infection.
- **Anemia, Leukocytosis, Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia**: No specific exclusions.

### 15. Blood Glucose Test
- **Range: 0-99 mg/dL**: Rule out Pre-Diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, and Diabetes Mellitus Type 1.
- **Range: 100-125 mg/dL**: Rule out Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and Diabetes Mellitus Type 1.
- **Range: 126-500 mg/dL**: Pre-Diabetes can be ruled out.

### 16. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
- **Normal**: Unstable Angina can be ruled out.

## Conclusion
This guide provides a framework for interpreting diagnostic test outcomes to rule out specific diseases. The effective use of this information requires careful analysis and professional judgment, emphasizing exclusion as a key strategy in narrowing down potential diagnoses.
