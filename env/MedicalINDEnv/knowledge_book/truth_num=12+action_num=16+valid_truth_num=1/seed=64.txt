## Diseases and Their Diagnostic Exclusions

### 1. Pre-Diabetes
Pre-Diabetes is a condition indicating higher than normal blood sugar levels, potentially leading to Type 2 Diabetes if not managed. 

#### Diagnostic Tests:
- **Blood Glucose Test**: 
  - A blood glucose level of 0-99 mg/dL or 126-500 mg/dL rules out Pre-Diabetes.

- **HbA1c Test**:
  - A level between 0.0% and 5.6% or 6.5% and 15.0% excludes Pre-Diabetes.

### 2. Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder causing inflammation of the joints.

#### Diagnostic Tests:
- **Rheumatoid Factor Test**:
  - A negative result rules out Rheumatoid Arthritis.

- **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**: 
  - An ESR level of 0-20 mm/hr rules out Rheumatoid Arthritis.

- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**:
  - A level between 0-5 mg/L excludes Rheumatoid Arthritis.

### 3. Sepsis
Sepsis is a severe, life-threatening reaction to infection requiring immediate medical attention.

#### Diagnostic Tests:
- **Blood Culture**:
  - No bacterial growth rules out Sepsis.

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:
  - A normal result can exclude Sepsis.

### 4. COVID-19
COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

#### Diagnostic Tests:
- **COVID-19 PCR Test**: 
  - A negative result rules out COVID-19.

### 5. HIV/AIDS
HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, potentially leading to AIDS if untreated.

#### Diagnostic Tests:
- **HIV Antibody Test**:
  - A negative result rules out HIV/AIDS.

### 6. Valvular Heart Disease
Valvular Heart Disease refers to damage or dysfunction of one or more of the heart's valves.

#### Diagnostic Tests:
- **Echocardiogram**:
  - A normal echocardiogram result rules out Valvular Heart Disease.

### 7. Stable Angina
Stable Angina is a type of chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.

#### Diagnostic Tests:
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**:
  - A normal ECG result rules out Stable Angina.

### 8. Anxiety Disorder

  - A negative result rules out Anxiety Disorder.

### 9. Fungal Infection
Fungal Infections occur when an invading fungus affects a part of the body.

#### Diagnostic Tests:
- **Blood Culture**:
  - No fungal growth rules out Fungal Infection.

- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**:
  - A level between 0-5 mg/L excludes Fungal Infection.

- **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**:
  - An ESR level of 0-20 mm/hr rules out Fungal Infection.

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:
  - A normal result can exclude Fungal Infection.

### 10. Viral Infection
Viral Infections are illnesses caused by viruses, affecting various parts of the body.

#### Diagnostic Tests:
- **Blood Culture**:
  - No viral growth rules out Viral Infection.

- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**:
  - A level between 0-5 mg/L excludes Viral Infection.

- **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**:
  - An ESR level of 0-20 mm/hr rules out Viral Infection.

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:
  - A normal result can exclude Viral Infection.

### 11. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
SLE is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks its own tissues, causing inflammation.

#### Diagnostic Tests:
- **Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) Test**:
  - A negative result rules out SLE.

- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**:
  - A level between 0-5 mg/L excludes SLE.

- **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**:
  - An ESR level of 0-20 mm/hr rules out SLE.

### 12. Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia
This condition arises from insufficient B12, leading to a reduced red blood cell count and associated symptoms of anemia.

#### Diagnostic Tests:
- **Vitamin B12 Level**:
  - Levels between 300-2000 pg/mL rule out Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia.

- **Peripheral Blood Smear**:
  - A normal result can exclude Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia.
  - A microcytic hypochromic result can exclude Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia.
  - Presence of sickle cells can exclude Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia.
  - Presence of blast cells can exclude Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia.

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:
  - A normal result can exclude Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia.
