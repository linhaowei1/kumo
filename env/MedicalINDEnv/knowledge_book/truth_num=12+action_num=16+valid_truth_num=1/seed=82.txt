# Medical Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction
This guidebook aims to provide an introduction to a range of diseases, the diagnostic tests used to identify these conditions, and specific outcomes that can help rule out particular diseases. By understanding these relationships, healthcare professionals can effectively narrow down potential diagnoses and provide accurate treatment.

## Diseases Overview

### Pre-Diabetes
Pre-Diabetes is a metabolic condition characterized by blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to qualify as diabetes. 

### Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia
This occurs when there is a lack of Vitamin B12, essential for the production of healthy red blood cells, leading to anemia.

### Iron Deficiency Anemia
A type of anemia caused by a shortage of iron, resulting in a reduced number of red blood cells.

### Aortic Stenosis
A condition where the aortic valve narrows, reducing blood flow from the heart.

### Depression
A mental health disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest.

### Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
A chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose), often due to insulin resistance.

### Coronary Artery Disease
A result of plaque buildup in the coronary arteries, this disease reduces blood flow to the heart.

### Unstable Angina
A condition signifying restricted blood flow and oxygen to the heart, leading to chest pain.

### Fungal Infection
An infection caused by fungi, affecting different parts of the body.

### Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
An autoimmune disease where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.

### Heart Failure
A chronic condition where the heart does not pump blood as well as it should.

### Stable Angina
Characterized by predictable chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart.

## Diagnostic Tests

### Peripheral Blood Smear
A test analyzing the size, shape, and appearance of blood cells.
- **Normal**: Rules out Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia and Iron Deficiency Anemia.
- **Microcytic Hypochromic**: Rules out Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia.
- **Macrocytic**: Rules out Iron Deficiency Anemia.
- **Sickle Cells**: Rules out both Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia and Iron Deficiency Anemia.
- **Blast Cells**: Rules out both Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia and Iron Deficiency Anemia.

### Blood Glucose Test
Measures blood sugar levels to assess metabolic function.
- **0-99 mg/dL**: Rules out Pre-Diabetes and Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.
- **100-125 mg/dL**: Rules out Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.
- **126-500 mg/dL**: Rules out Pre-Diabetes.

### Lipid Profile
Assesses cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
- **Normal**: Rules out Coronary Artery Disease.

### Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)
Measures inflammation in the body.
- **0-20 mm/hr**: Rules out Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Fungal Infection.

### Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Records the electrical activity of the heart.
- **Normal**: Rules out Stable Angina and Unstable Angina.

### Echocardiogram
Evaluates the heartâ€™s structures and function.
- **Normal**: Rules out Aortic Stenosis and Heart Failure.

### Depression Screening Questionnaire
Assesses symptoms of depression.
- **Negative**: Rules out Depression.

### Anti-Nuclear Antibody (ANA) Test
Detects autoantibodies present in autoimmune disorders.
- **Negative**: Rules out Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).

### Vitamin B12 Level
Measures the amount of vitamin B12 in the blood.
- **300-2000 pg/mL**: Rules out Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia.

### Troponin Levels
Evaluates heart muscle damage.
- **Normal**: Rules out Unstable Angina.

### Anxiety Screening Questionnaire
Assesses symptoms of anxiety.
- **Negative**: Rules out Depression.

### Iron Studies
Examine iron levels to diagnose anemia.
- **Normal**: Rules out Iron Deficiency Anemia.

### HbA1c Test
Measures average blood glucose over the past 2-3 months.
- **0.0-5.6%**: Rules out Pre-Diabetes and Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.
- **5.7-6.4%**: Rules out Diabetes Mellitus Type 2.
- **6.5-15.0%**: Rules out Pre-Diabetes.

### C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
Assesses inflammation and infection.
- **0-5 mg/L**: Rules out Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Fungal Infection.

### Complete Blood Count (CBC)
Evaluates overall health and detects a variety of disorders.
- **Normal**: Rules out Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia, Fungal Infection, and Iron Deficiency Anemia.

### Blood Culture
Identifies bacteria or fungi in blood.
- **No Growth**: Rules out Fungal Infection.
