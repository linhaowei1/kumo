## Conclusion

This guidebook offers a comprehensive overview of several common diseases and the corresponding diagnostic tests used to potentially rule out these conditions. It is essential for healthcare providers to understand the exclusionary nature of test results to avoid misdiagnosis and enhance patient care.

Remember, while these tests can rule out certain diseases, a comprehensive clinical evaluation is necessary to confirm a diagnosis. Consult with a medical professional for an accurate assessment.
