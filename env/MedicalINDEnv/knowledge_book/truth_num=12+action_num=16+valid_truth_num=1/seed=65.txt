## Introduction
This guidebook provides a concise introduction to several diseases and diagnostic tests, along with their corresponding outcomes. Each test and outcome helps medical professionals to rule out specific diseases, streamlining the diagnostic process.

## Diseases and Diagnostic Tests

### 1. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
**Description**: A chronic condition that affects the body's ability to regulate sugar (glucose) in the blood.
**Diagnostic Tests**:
- **HbA1c Test**: Measures average blood sugar over the past two to three months.
  - Rule-Out:
    - Levels between 0.0 and 5.6 rule out both Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and Pre-Diabetes.
    - Levels between 5.7 and 6.4 rule out Pre-Diabetes.
- **Blood Glucose Test**: Measures current blood sugar levels.
  - Rule-Out:
    - Levels between 0 and 99 rule out both Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and Pre-Diabetes.
    - Levels between 100 and 125 rule out Pre-Diabetes.

### 2. Pre-Diabetes
**Description**: A condition where blood sugar levels are elevated above normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes.
**Diagnostic Tests**:
- **HbA1c Test**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - Levels between 0.0 and 5.6 rule out Pre-Diabetes.
    - Levels between 6.5 and 15.0 rule out Pre-Diabetes.
- **Blood Glucose Test**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - Levels between 0 and 99 rule out Pre-Diabetes.
    - Levels between 126 and 500 rule out Pre-Diabetes.

### 3. Fungal Infection
**Description**: Infections caused by fungi, affecting various parts of the body.
**Diagnostic Tests**:
- **Blood Culture**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - No growth rules out Fungal Infection.
- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)** and **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - CRP levels between 0 and 5, and ESR levels between 0 and 20, rule out Fungal Infection.

### 4. Aortic Stenosis
**Description**: Narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart, which can restrict blood flow.
**Diagnostic Tests**:
- **Echocardiogram**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - A normal echocardiogram rules out Aortic Stenosis.

### 5. Sepsis
**Description**: A life-threatening response to infection leading to systemic inflammation and potential organ failure.
**Diagnostic Tests**:
- **Blood Culture**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - No growth rules out Sepsis.
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - A normal CBC rules out Sepsis.

### 6. Bacterial Infection
**Description**: Infections caused by bacteria, which can affect various parts of the body.
**Diagnostic Tests**:
- **Blood Culture**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - No growth rules out Bacterial Infection.
- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)** and **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - CRP levels between 0 and 5, and ESR levels between 0 and 20, rule out Bacterial Infection.
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - A normal CBC rules out Bacterial Infection.

### 7. HIV/AIDS
**Description**: A chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
**Diagnostic Tests**:
- **HIV Antibody Test**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - A negative test rules out HIV/AIDS.

### 8. Coronary Artery Disease
**Description**: A disease characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries.
**Diagnostic Tests**:
- **Lipid Profile**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - A normal lipid profile rules out Coronary Artery Disease.

### 9. Anemia of Chronic Disease
**Description**: A type of anemia seen in chronic infection, inflammation, or other chronic diseases.
**Diagnostic Tests**:
- **Peripheral Blood Smear**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - A normal smear, presence of sickle cells, and presence of blast cells rule out Anemia of Chronic Disease.
- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)** and **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - CRP levels between 0 and 5, and ESR levels between 0 and 20, rule out Anemia of Chronic Disease.
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - A normal CBC rules out Anemia of Chronic Disease.

### 10. Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia
**Description**: A type of anemia caused by a lack of vitamin B12, affecting red blood cell production.
**Diagnostic Tests**:
- **Peripheral Blood Smear**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - A normal smear, presence of sickle cells, and presence of blast cells rule out Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia.
- **Vitamin B12 Level**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - Levels between 300 and 2000 rule out Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia.

### 11. Osteoporosis
**Description**: A disease characterized by the thinning of bones, increasing fracture risk.
**Diagnostic Tests**:
- **Bone Mineral Density Test**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - Scores between -2.5 and -1.0, and between -1.0 and 4.0, rule out Osteoporosis.

### 12. Myocardial Infarction
**Description**: Commonly known as a heart attack, it occurs when blood flow to the heart is blocked.
**Diagnostic Tests**:
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - A normal ECG rules out Myocardial Infarction.
- **Troponin Levels**:
  - Rule-Out:
    - Normal levels rule out Myocardial Infarction.
