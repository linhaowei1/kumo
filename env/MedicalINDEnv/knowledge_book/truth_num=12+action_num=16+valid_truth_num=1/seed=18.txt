# Medical Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook aims to provide an insightful overview of various diseases along with the diagnostic tests used to evaluate and manage them. The focus is on understanding the diseases and how specific test outcomes can be used to rule out certain conditions. This will assist healthcare providers in making accurate diagnoses.

## Diseases Overview

### 1. Iron Deficiency Anemia
Iron Deficiency Anemia is a common type of anemia caused by insufficient iron, leading to reduced production of hemoglobin. Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, and pale skin.

### 2. Valvular Heart Disease
This encompasses disorders affecting one or more of the heart valves, leading to disrupted blood flow within the heart. Common symptoms include shortness of breath and chest pain.

### 3. Stable Angina
Stable angina is characterized by chest pain or discomfort, typically triggered by physical activity or stress and relieved by rest or medication. It occurs due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.

### 4. Peptic Ulcer Disease
Peptic ulcers are sores that develop on the inner lining of the stomach or the upper part of the small intestine. Common symptoms include burning stomach pain and bloating.

### 5. Osteopenia
Osteopenia is a condition where bone mineral density is lower than normal, which may lead to osteoporosis if not managed properly. It often shows no symptoms but can be detected through a bone density test.

### 6. Aortic Stenosis
Aortic stenosis involves narrowing of the aortic valve, which obstructs blood flow from the heart to the aorta. Symptoms include chest pain, fainting, and shortness of breath.

### 7. Fungal Infection
Fungal infections can affect the skin or other organs. They range from mild to severe and include symptoms like itchiness, redness, and in some cases, systemic symptoms if internal organs are affected.

### 8. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
SLE is an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. Symptoms vary widely but often include fatigue, joint pain, and skin rashes.

### 9. Depression
Depression is a mood disorder with symptoms such as persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, and decreased energy levels.

### 10. Coronary Artery Disease
This disease occurs when the coronary arteries become narrowed or blocked, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart. It can cause chest pain and increase the risk of heart attacks.

### 11. Pre-Diabetes
Pre-Diabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes. It increases the risk of developing diabetes.

### 12. Heart Failure
Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body's needs. Symptoms often include fatigue, breathlessness, and swelling in the legs.

## Diagnostic Tests and Rule-Out Outcomes

- **Normal**: Rule out Fungal Infection and Iron Deficiency Anemia.
- **Other Results**: No exclusions.

### 10. C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
- **Outcome (0 - 5)**: Rule out Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Fungal Infection.
- **Outcome (6 - 200)**: No exclusions.
