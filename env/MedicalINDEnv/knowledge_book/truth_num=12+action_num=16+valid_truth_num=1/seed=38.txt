## Diseases and Diagnostic Tests

### 1. Myocardial Infarction
**Overview:** Commonly known as a heart attack, myocardial infarction occurs when blood flow to the heart is blocked, causing damage to the heart muscle.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**
  - **Normal Result:** Rules out Myocardial Infarction and Stable Angina.
- **Troponin Levels:**
  - **Normal Result:** Rules out Myocardial Infarction.

### 2. Osteopenia
**Overview:** Osteopenia is a condition characterized by lower-than-normal bone density, which can lead to weakened bones.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Bone Mineral Density Test:**
  - **Results between -4.0 and -2.5 or -1.0 and 4.0:** Does not rule out Osteopenia (since these ranges are associated with Osteopenia).

### 3. Peptic Ulcer Disease
**Overview:** This condition involves the formation of sores or ulcers in the lining of the stomach or the first part of the small intestine.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Upper Endoscopy:**
  - **Normal Result:** Rules out Peptic Ulcer Disease.

### 4. Depression
**Overview:** A mental health disorder characterized by persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, affecting daily life.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Depression Screening Questionnaire:**
  - **Negative Result:** Rules out Depression and Bipolar Disorder.
- **Anxiety Screening Questionnaire:**
  - **Negative Result:** Rules out Depression and Bipolar Disorder.

### 5. Heart Failure
**Overview:** A condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to shortness of breath and fluid retention.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Echocardiogram:**
  - **Normal Result:** Rules out Heart Failure.

### 6. Folate Deficiency Anemia
**Overview:** A type of anemia caused by a lack of folate, a type of B vitamin, leading to insufficient red blood cell production.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Peripheral Blood Smear:**
  - **Microcytic Hypochromic Result:** Excludes Folate Deficiency Anemia.
  - **Sickle Cells or Blast Cells Result:** Excludes Folate Deficiency Anemia.
- **Folate Level:**
  - **Results between 5 and 50:** Excludes Folate Deficiency Anemia.

### 7. Anemia of Chronic Disease
**Overview:** A form of anemia that occurs in individuals with chronic inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic diseases.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Peripheral Blood Smear:**
  - **Macrocytic Result:** Excludes Anemia of Chronic Disease.
  - **Sickle Cells or Blast Cells Result:** Excludes Anemia of Chronic Disease.
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
  - **Normal Result:** Excludes Anemia of Chronic Disease.
- **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):**
  - **Results between 0 and 20:** Excludes Anemia of Chronic Disease.

### 8. Bipolar Disorder
**Overview:** A mental disorder causing extreme mood swings, including emotional highs (mania) and lows (depression).

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Depression Screening Questionnaire:**
  - **Negative Result:** Rules out Bipolar Disorder.
- **Anxiety Screening Questionnaire:**
  - **Negative Result:** Rules out Bipolar Disorder.

### 9. Stable Angina
**Overview:** A condition marked by chest pain due to the heart getting insufficient blood supply, typically triggered by physical activity or stress.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**
  - **Normal Result:** Rules out Myocardial Infarction and Stable Angina.

### 10. Pre-Diabetes
**Overview:** A condition characterized by higher-than-normal blood sugar levels, not yet high enough to be considered type 2 diabetes.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **HbA1c Test:**
  - **Results between 0.0 and 5.6 or 6.5 and 15.0:** Does not rule out Pre-Diabetes (since these ranges are associated with Pre-Diabetes).
- **Blood Glucose Test:**
  - **Results between 0 and 99 or 126 and 500:** Does not rule out Pre-Diabetes (since these ranges are associated with Pre-Diabetes).

### 11. Iron Deficiency Anemia
**Overview:** This anemia results from a deficiency of iron, leading to a reduced number of red blood cells.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Peripheral Blood Smear:**
  - **Macrocytic, Sickle Cells, or Blast Cells Result:** Rules out Iron Deficiency Anemia.
- **Iron Studies:**
  - **Normal Result:** Rules out Iron Deficiency Anemia.

### 12. Fungal Infection
**Overview:** Infections caused by fungi, which affect various body parts, commonly the skin and lungs.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- **Blood Culture:**
  - **No Growth Result:** Excludes Fungal Infection.
- **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):**
  - **Results between 0 and 20:** Excludes Fungal Infection and Anemia of Chronic Disease.
- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP):**
  - **Results between 0 and 5:** Excludes Fungal Infection and Anemia of Chronic Disease.
