## Diseases Overview

1. **Peptic Ulcer Disease**
   
   Peptic Ulcer Disease involves the formation of sores in the lining of the stomach or the first part of the small intestine. These ulcers often result from inflammation caused by H. pylori bacteria or from the long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

2. **Arrhythmia**
   
   Arrhythmia refers to an irregular heartbeat. It can manifest as a heartbeat that is too fast, too slow, or erratic, causing various symptoms like palpitations or fatigue.

3. **HIV/AIDS**

   HIV/AIDS involves a virus that damages the immune system by attacking infection-fighting cells. HIV gradually progresses to AIDS, where the immune system is severely compromised.

4. **Pre-Diabetes**

   Pre-Diabetes is a condition characterized by slightly elevated blood sugar levels, indicating a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

5. **Leukemia**

   Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, characterized by the production of abnormal white blood cells.

6. **Rheumatoid Arthritis**

   Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints, leading to inflammation, pain, and possible joint damage.

7. **Osteoporosis**

   Osteoporosis is a bone disease that causes bones to become weak and brittle, often leading to fractures.

8. **Folate Deficiency Anemia**

   Folate Deficiency Anemia results from a lack of folic acid, a type of vitamin B, leading to decreased red blood cell production.

9. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**

   GERD is a chronic condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, leading to symptoms like heartburn.

10. **Metabolic Syndrome**

    Metabolic Syndrome is a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. These include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels.

11. **Bipolar Disorder**

    Bipolar Disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs and lows.

12. **Viral Infection**

    A viral infection involves a virus entering the body and starting to multiply, potentially leading to diseases or influencing immune responses.

## Diagnostic Tests and Their Outcomes

1. **Peripheral Blood Smear**
   
   A Peripheral Blood Smear is a test that examines the characteristics of blood cells under a microscope. Observations from this test are used to rule out certain diseases:
   - **Normal**: Rules out Leukemia and Folate Deficiency Anemia.
   - **Microcytic Hypochromic**: Rules out Leukemia and Folate Deficiency Anemia.
   - **Macrocytic**: Rules out Leukemia.
   - **Sickle Cells**: Rules out Leukemia and Folate Deficiency Anemia.
   - **Blast Cells**: Rules out Folate Deficiency Anemia.

2. **HbA1c Test**
   
   The HbA1c test measures average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months. Results are interpreted as follows:
   - Levels between **0.0 and 5.6**: Rule out Pre-Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome.
   - Levels between **5.7 and 6.4**: *(No diseases are ruled out based on this range.)*
   - Levels between **6.5 and 15.0**: Rule out Pre-Diabetes.

3. **Lipid Profile**
   
   A Lipid Profile measures cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Results interpretation:
   - **Normal**: Rules out Metabolic Syndrome.

4. **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)**
   
   ESR is a blood test that can detect inflammation in the body. ESR values:
   - Between **0 and 20**: Rule out Rheumatoid Arthritis and Viral Infection.

5. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**
   
   An ECG records the electrical activity of the heart. Observations include:
   - **Normal**: Rules out Arrhythmia.

6. **HIV Antibody Test**
   
   This test detects antibodies to HIV to understand exposure to the virus:
   - **Negative**: Rules out HIV/AIDS.

7. **Upper Endoscopy**
   
   An Upper Endoscopy examines the upper part of the digestive tract. Findings:
   - **Normal**: Rules out Peptic Ulcer Disease and GERD.

8. **Bone Mineral Density Test**
   
   This test evaluates the density of bones and can indicate bone strength:
   - Values between **-2.5 and -1.0**, or **-1.0 and 4.0**: Rule out Osteoporosis.

9. **Depression Screening Questionnaire**
   
   This tool assesses symptoms of depression:
   - **Negative**: Rules out Bipolar Disorder.

10. **Blood Glucose Test**
    
    This test measures the amount of glucose in the blood:
    - Levels between **0 and 99**: Rule out Metabolic Syndrome and Pre-Diabetes.
    - Levels between **126 and 500**: Rule out Pre-Diabetes.

11. **Folate Level**
    
    This test measures the level of folate in the blood, essential for diagnosing Folate Deficiency Anemia:
    - Levels between **5 and 50**: Rule out Folate Deficiency Anemia.

12. **Blood Culture**
    
    A Blood Culture checks for infections in the blood:
    - **No Growth**: Rules out Viral Infection.

13. **Rheumatoid Factor Test**
    
    This test helps diagnose rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases:
    - **Negative**: Rules out Rheumatoid Arthritis.

14. **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**
    
    CRP levels in the blood increase in response to inflammation:
    - Levels between **0 and 5**: Rule out Rheumatoid Arthritis and Viral Infection.

15. **Anxiety Screening Questionnaire**
    
    This questionnaire assesses anxiety symptoms:
    - **Negative**: Rules out Bipolar Disorder.

16. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**
    
    A CBC analysis provides information about cells in the blood:
    - **Normal**: Rules out Leukemia, Folate Deficiency Anemia, and Viral Infection.
