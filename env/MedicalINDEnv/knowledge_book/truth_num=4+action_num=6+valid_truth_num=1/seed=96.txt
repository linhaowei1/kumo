## Diseases Overview

1. **Stable Angina**
   - **Description**: Stable angina is chest pain or discomfort that typically occurs with activity or stress due to reduced blood flow to the heart. It is predictable and typically relieved with rest or medication.
   
2. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**
   - **Description**: GERD is a digestive disorder where stomach acid frequently flows back into the esophagus, leading to heartburn and irritation.
   
3. **Coronary Artery Disease**
   - **Description**: Coronary artery disease involves narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries due to plaque buildup, which can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, or heart attacks.
   
4. **COVID-19**
   - **Description**: COVID-19 is a contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, presenting with symptoms ranging from mild (fever, cough) to severe (difficulty breathing, pneumonia).

## Diagnostic Tests and Interpretation of Outcomes

### 1. COVID-19 PCR Test
   - **Purpose**: To detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **Positive**: Does not rule out any specified diseases.
     - **Negative**: Rules out COVID-19.

### 2. Lipid Profile
   - **Purpose**: To measure cholesterol levels, helping assess the risk of heart diseases.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **Normal Cholesterol Levels**: Rules out coronary artery disease as a possibility due to a normal lipid profile.
     - **Elevated Cholesterol, Elevated Triglycerides, Low HDL**: No specific disease is ruled out based on these results alone.

### 3. Upper Endoscopy
   - **Purpose**: To visually examine the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum for abnormalities.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **Normal**: Rules out GERD as a potential diagnosis due to the absence of observable abnormalities.
     - **Esophagitis, Gastric Ulcer, Duodenal Ulcer**: These specific findings do not rule out any of the diseases specified.

### 4. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
   - **Purpose**: To monitor the electrical activity of the heart and identify any irregularities.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **Normal**: Rules out stable angina, as no significant heart changes are detected.
     - **Arrhythmia, Ischemic Changes, Left Ventricular Hypertrophy, Myocardial Infarction Pattern**: These results do not exclude any specified diseases.

### 5. Complete Blood Count (CBC)
   - **Purpose**: To evaluate overall health and detect a wide range of disorders, including anemia and infection.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **Normal**: Does not rule out any diseases.
     - **Anemia, Leukocytosis, Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia**: These conditions do not exclude any specified diseases.

### 6. Blood Glucose Test
   - **Purpose**: To measure the level of glucose in the blood, aiding in diagnosing diabetes or prediabetes.
   - **Outcomes**:
     - **0-99 mg/dL (Normal)**: No exclusionary rule for specified diseases.
     - **100-125 mg/dL (Prediabetes)**: No exclusionary rule is indicated for the diseases specified.
     - **126-500 mg/dL (Diabetes)**: No exclusionary rule is indicated for the diseases specified.
