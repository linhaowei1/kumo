## Diagnostic Tests and Rule-Out Criteria

### 1. HbA1c Test
- **Purpose:** Measures the average blood glucose levels over the past 3 months.
- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - HbA1c levels between **0.0 and 5.6** rule out **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2**.
  - HbA1c levels between **5.7 and 6.4** also rule out **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2**.
  - HbA1c levels between **6.5 and 15.0** do not rule out any specific conditions based on the criteria outlined.

### 2. Depression Screening Questionnaire
- **Purpose:** Screens for symptoms of depression.
- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - A positive result does not rule out any diseases.
  - A negative result rules out **Bipolar Disorder** and **Anxiety Disorder**, indicating that these are less likely.

### 3. Blood Culture
- **Purpose:** Detects the presence of fungi or bacteria in the blood.
- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - No growth indicates that a **Fungal Infection** is ruled out.
  - Bacterial growth does not rule out any specific conditions.

### 4. Complete Blood Count (CBC)
- **Purpose:** Provides information about the kinds and numbers of cells in the blood.
- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - A normal CBC rules out a **Fungal Infection**.
  - Outcomes such as anemia, leukocytosis, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia do not rule out any specific diseases in our focus areas.

### 5. Anxiety Screening Questionnaire
- **Purpose:** Screens for symptoms of anxiety.
- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - A positive result does not rule out any diseases.
  - A negative result rules out **Bipolar Disorder** and **Anxiety Disorder**.

### 6. Blood Glucose Test
- **Purpose:** Measures current blood sugar levels.
- **Outcomes and Rule-Outs:**
  - Glucose levels between **0 and 99** rule out **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2**.
  - Glucose levels between **100 and 125** also rule out **Diabetes Mellitus Type 2**.
  - Glucose levels between **126 and 500** do not rule out any specific conditions based on the criteria outlined but are considered diagnostic for diabetes.
