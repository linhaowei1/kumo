# Programming Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook introduces essential concepts and methodologies surrounding the evaluation of specific algorithms based on various qualitative and quantitative tests. The focus is on understanding the nature of these algorithms, engaging practical experiments to ascertain their behaviors, and delineating criteria for exclusion based on observed outcomes.

### Algorithms

1. **Basic Hash Functions**
   - Hash functions are used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. They play crucial roles in many computer science applications like data retrieval, encryption, and more. However, basic hash functions often suffer from issues like collisions (where different inputs produce the same hash output).

2. **NP-hard Problems**
   - Problems classified as NP-hard are computationally intensive and often lack efficient solutions. They require intricate strategies for any approximation of solutions, posing significant challenges in fields like optimization, computation theory, and cryptography.

3. **RSA Encryption Algorithm**
   - The RSA algorithm is a widely used form of public-key cryptography enabling secure data transmission. It relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large integers and is critical for secure communications over the internet.

4. **Hashing**
   - Hashing involves the conversion of data into a fixed-size hash value. It is key in data structures (like hash tables), cryptographic applications, and is renowned for its role in enhancing the security and performance of systems.

### Experiments

1. **Execution Time Benchmarking**
   - Measures the time taken by an algorithm to complete a task. This helps in assessing its efficiency and performance under different workload scales.

2. **Cryptographic Strength Test**
   - Evaluates the robustness of encryption algorithms against various attack vectors. It is essential for verifying the security level provided by cryptographic functions.

3. **Collision Resistance Test**
   - Examines the likelihood of different inputs producing the same hash value in hashing functions. High collision resistance is desired to maintain the integrity of hashed data.

4. **Cache Performance Measurement**
   - Determines the efficacy of algorithm operations with respect to the processor cache performance. High cache hit rates typically reflect better performance.

5. **Computational Complexity Class**
   - Classifies algorithms based on their computational difficulty (e.g., P and NP classes). This evaluation is crucial in understanding theoretical limits and efficiencies of different algorithms.

6. **Sensitivity Analysis**
   - Investigates the robustness of an algorithm in response to variations in input data or parameters.

### Outcomes and Exclusion Rules

For each experiment, certain outcomes necessitate the exclusion of specific algorithms based on their deficiencies or inapplicability under those conditions:

1. **Execution Time Benchmarking**
   - **Outcome (0, 1)**: All algorithms are NOT excluded.
   - **Outcome (1, 10)**: All algorithms are NOT excluded.
   - **Outcome (10, 100)**: Exclude `Hashing`.

2. **Cryptographic Strength Test**
   - **Strong**: Exclude `RSA Encryption Algorithm`.
   - **Weak**: Exclude `Hashing`.

3. **Collision Resistance Test**
   - **High Collision Resistance**: All algorithms are NOT excluded.
   - **Low Collision Resistance**: Exclude `Basic Hash Functions`.

4. **Cache Performance Measurement**
   - **High Cache Hit Rate**: Exclude `Hashing`.
   - **Low Cache Hit Rate**: All algorithms are NOT excluded.

5. **Computational Complexity Class**
   - **P**: Exclude `NP-hard problems`.
   - **NP**: All algorithms are NOT excluded.

6. **Sensitivity Analysis**
   - **Sensitive**: All algorithms are NOT excluded.
   - **Robust**: All algorithms are NOT excluded.

By following this guidebook, practitioners can evaluate the appropriateness of different algorithms for specific applications based on desired efficiency, security, and computational characteristics. This logical exclusion methodology ensures a clear understanding of which algorithms to avoid under specific experimental conditions.
