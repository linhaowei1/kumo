# Programming Analysis Guidebook: Algorithms and Experiments

This guidebook provides an introduction to a selection of algorithms and outlines a series of experiments aimed at analyzing various aspects of these algorithms. Emphasis is placed on understanding the relationship between experimental outcomes and their implications for selecting appropriate algorithms for computational problems.

## Chapter 1: Algorithms Overview

### Approximation Algorithms
Approximation algorithms are algorithms designed to find near-optimal solutions to optimization problems, where finding the exact solution is computationally infeasible. These algorithms provide solutions within a guaranteed factor of the optimal solution and are particularly useful for NP-hard problems. However, they may not always yield the exact optimal solution.

### Radix Sort
Radix Sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that processes individual digits of numbers. It works efficiently for fixed-length integers or strings and exhibits stable sorting characteristics. It's known for its linear time complexity, O(nk), where n is the number of elements and k is the number of digits.

### RSA Encryption Algorithm
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptographic algorithm used for secure data transmission. It is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers and is widely used for securing sensitive data. RSA provides strong cryptographic strength and is foundational in many encryption and authentication protocols.

### Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. They are typically easier to implement and perform well on problems with "greedy choice" properties, though they may not always produce optimal solutions for all problem types.

## Chapter 2: Experiments and Analysis

In this chapter, we investigate various experiments designed to assess different characteristics of the mentioned algorithms. The analyses include experiments on space complexity, optimality, cryptographic strength, execution time, heuristic effectiveness, and cache performance.
