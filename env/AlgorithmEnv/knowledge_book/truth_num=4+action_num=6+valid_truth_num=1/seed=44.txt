## Programming Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook introduces four fundamental algorithms and a series of experiments designed to analyze their characteristics. The goal is to understand how to rule out certain algorithms for specific scenarios based on the outcomes of these experiments. 

### Algorithms Overview

1. **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**
   - **Description**: ECC is a form of public key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. It is used for creating smaller, faster, and more efficient cryptographic keys.
   
2. **LZW Compression**
   - **Description**: The Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm is a lossless data compression method that encodes sequences of symbols into a shorter representation based on a dictionary-based approach.
   
3. **Decision Trees**
   - **Description**: Decision trees are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. They model decisions and their possible consequences using tree-like structures.
   
4. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
   - **Description**: The Bellman-Ford algorithm is an algorithm for computing shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It is capable of handling graphs with negative weight edges.

### Experiments

1. **Parallelizability Test**
   - **Purpose**: To evaluate the degree to which an algorithm can be parallelized. 
   - **Exclusion Rule**: 
     - If "Highly Parallelizable" is the outcome, exclude the Bellman-Ford Algorithm.
   
2. **Accuracy Measurement**
   - **Purpose**: To determine the accuracy of an algorithm, particularly relevant for decision-making processes.
   - **Exclusion Rule**:
     - If the accuracy falls within (0.0, 0.5), exclude Decision Trees.

3. **Cryptographic Strength Test**
   - **Purpose**: To assess the strength of cryptographic algorithms against potential attacks.
   - **Exclusion Rule**:
     - If the cryptographic strength is evaluated as "Strong", exclude Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

4. **Robustness Test**
   - **Purpose**: To evaluate an algorithm's ability to handle errors and disruptions.
   - **Exclusion Rule**:
     - If "Not Robust" is the outcome, exclude Decision Trees.

5. **Decompression Speed Test**
   - **Purpose**: To measure the speed at which compressed data can be decompressed.
   - **Exclusion Rule**:
     - If decompression speed falls within (1, 10), exclude LZW Compression.

6. **Compression Ratio Measurement**
   - **Purpose**: To quantify the effectiveness of an algorithm in reducing data size.
   - **Exclusion Rule**:
     - If the compression ratio falls within (0, 0.5), exclude LZW Compression.

### Summary of Exclusion Rules

- **Parallelizability Test**:
  - Highly Parallelizable: Exclude Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- **Accuracy Measurement**:
  - Accuracy (0.0, 0.5): Exclude Decision Trees
- **Cryptographic Strength Test**:
  - Strong: Exclude Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- **Robustness Test**:
  - Not Robust: Exclude Decision Trees
- **Decompression Speed Test**:
  - Speed (1, 10): Exclude LZW Compression
- **Compression Ratio Measurement**:
  - Ratio (0, 0.5): Exclude LZW Compression

By utilizing these rules, users can systematically narrow down suitable algorithms for specific problem domains based on empirical experiment outcomes, ensuring a more targeted and efficient selection process.
