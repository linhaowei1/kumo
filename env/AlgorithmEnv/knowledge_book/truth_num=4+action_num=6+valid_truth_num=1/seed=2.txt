# Programming Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook is primarily designed to introduce various algorithms and the corresponding experimental techniques used to evaluate their suitability for specific tasks. The focus is on understanding the methodologies and exclusion rules based on experimental outcomes.

### Algorithms Overview

1. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**:
   - A graph search algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
   - It is known for handling graphs with negative weight edges.

2. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - A popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning data into k distinct clusters based on feature similarity.
   - It iteratively refines cluster centers to minimize variance within clusters.

3. **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**:
   - A heuristic search algorithm used for decision processes, such as game playing.
   - It explores possible moves using random sampling and builds a search tree based on promising moves.

4. **Gradient Descent**:
   - An optimization algorithm used to minimize functions by iteratively moving towards the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.

### Experiments and Tests

These tests are designed to assess the viability and performance of the algorithms described:

1. **Time Complexity Analysis**:
   - This test evaluates the computational efficiency of an algorithm concerning input size.
   
2. **Convergence Time Test**:
   - Measures how quickly an iterative algorithm approaches its optimal solution or stable state.
   
3. **Precision & Recall Evaluation**:
   - Used to assess the performance of classification algorithms, typically in machine learning, considering both false positives and false negatives.
   
4. **Parallelizability Test**:
   - Determines whether an algorithm can be effectively executed on multiple processors simultaneously to improve performance.
   
5. **Error Rate Measurement**:
   - Calculates how often the algorithm produces incorrect results, key for algorithms in prediction or decision processes.
   
6. **Space Complexity Measurement**:
   - Evaluates the memory usage of an algorithm as a function of the input size.

### Exclusion Rules Based on Outcomes

For each experimental test, certain algorithms are excluded when specific outcomes are observed. Below are the relevant exclusion rules:

#### Time Complexity Analysis
- **Outcome O(n log n) or better**:
  - Exclude: Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- **Outcome O(n^2) or worse**:
  - No exclusions applicable

#### Convergence Time Test
- **Outcome (0, 10)**:
  - Exclude: Gradient Descent
- **Outcome (10, 1000)**:
  - No exclusions applicable

#### Precision & Recall Evaluation
- **Outcome (0.0, 0.7)**:
  - Exclude: K-Means Clustering
- **Outcome (0.7, 1.0)**:
  - No exclusions applicable

#### Parallelizability Test
- **Outcome Highly Parallelizable**:
  - Exclude: Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- **Outcome Not Parallelizable**:
  - No exclusions applicable

#### Error Rate Measurement
- **Outcome (0.0, 0.1)**:
  - No exclusions applicable
- **Outcome (0.1, 1.0)**:
  - Exclude: K-Means Clustering

#### Space Complexity Measurement
- **Outcome High Memory Usage**:
  - Exclude: Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- **Outcome Low Memory Usage**:
  - No exclusions applicable

## Conclusion

This guidebook outlines the algorithms and the corresponding experimental evaluations that define their suitability based on exclusion criteria. By understanding these experiments and outcomes, you can effectively determine the appropriateness or elimination of specific algorithms for a given problem context.
