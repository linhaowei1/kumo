# Programming Analysis Guidebook

This guidebook provides an introduction to various algorithms and experiments to understand their performance characteristics and suitability for different computational problems. The algorithms covered include LZW Compression, Apriori Algorithm, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort. We explore experiments such as Worst Case Execution Time, Precision & Recall Evaluation, Compression Ratio Measurement, Computational Complexity Class, Memory Usage Profiling, and Cache Performance Measurement.

## Algorithms

### LZW Compression
LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) is a lossless data compression algorithm that creates a dictionary of sequences from the input data to replace repeated occurrences, thus reducing the file size.

### Apriori Algorithm
The Apriori Algorithm is used in data mining for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. It is particularly useful in market basket analysis.

### Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time, with good performance in nearly-sorted data.

### Quick Sort
Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm, using a divide-and-conquer approach to sort items with a pivot element as the partitioning point.

## Experiments

### Worst Case Execution Time
This experiment measures the maximum time an algorithm could take to complete under the worst possible conditions.

### Precision & Recall Evaluation
This test is utilized in evaluating algorithms involved in obtaining relevant results for specific queries, common in classification tasks, by measuring precision (positive predictive value) and recall (sensitivity).

### Compression Ratio Measurement
This experiment assesses the effectiveness of a compression algorithm by measuring the ratio of the compressed data to the original data size.

### Computational Complexity Class
This assessment in computational theory categorizes algorithms based on their computational complexity, such as P (polynomial time) and NP (nondeterministic polynomial time).

### Memory Usage Profiling
This experiment involves measuring the amount of memory an algorithm uses, important in understanding resource consumption.

### Cache Performance Measurement
This test evaluates how well an algorithm utilizes the CPU cache, with cache hit rate indicating performance efficiency.

## Outcomes and Exclusion Rules

The outcomes of the experiments determine which algorithms are not suitable based on their characteristics. The following exclusion rules apply:

### Worst Case Execution Time
- For execution time between 0 and 10 units, Quick Sort is ruled out.
- For execution time between 10 and 1000 units, Insertion Sort is ruled out.

### Precision & Recall Evaluation
- For precision & recall values between 0.0 and 0.7, Apriori Algorithm is ruled out.
- For precision & recall values between 0.7 and 1.0, there are no specific algorithms ruled out.

### Compression Ratio Measurement
- For compression ratios between 0 and 0.5, LZW Compression is ruled out.
- For compression ratios between 0.5 and 1.0, no algorithms are ruled out.

### Computational Complexity Class
- If the computational complexity class is NP, Quick Sort is ruled out.
- If the computational complexity class is P, no algorithms are ruled out.

### Memory Usage Profiling
- For memory usage from 0 to 100 units and 100 to 1000 units, there are no algorithms ruled out.
- For memory usage from 1000 to 10000 units, Quick Sort is ruled out.

### Cache Performance Measurement
- For achieving a High Cache Hit Rate, no algorithms are ruled out.
- For Low Cache Hit Rate, Quick Sort is ruled out.

This analysis guidebook serves as a decision-making tool for selecting appropriate algorithms based on experimental outcomes while clearly delineating which algorithms are ruled out for specific observations.
