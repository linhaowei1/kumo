# Programming Analysis Guidebook

## Introduction

This guidebook aims to provide an understanding of various algorithms and the methodology to assess them through specific experiments. The focus will be on four key algorithms: Monte Carlo Tree Search, Huffman Coding, Secure Hash Algorithms, and PageRank Algorithm. Furthermore, we will explore a suite of experimental techniques tailored for algorithm evaluation, including execution time benchmarking, compression ratio measurement, collision resistance testing, memory usage profiling, decompression speed tests, and disk I/O measurement. Upon conducting these experiments, certain outcomes can be used to exclude specific algorithms from consideration based on their suitability.

## Algorithms Overview

### 1. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
Monte Carlo Tree Search is a decision-making algorithm used in artificial intelligence primarily in game playing. MCTS builds a search tree and uses random sampling of the search space to make decisions. It combines exploration and exploitation strategies to find the optimal path by simulating numerous possible future play-outs.

### 2. Huffman Coding
Huffman Coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. It assigns variable length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters, thereby reducing the overall size required to encode the data.

### 3. Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA)
Secure Hash Algorithms comprise a family of cryptographic hash functions that ensure data integrity. They are widely utilized in security protocols for secure data transmission by producing a fixed-size hash value from input data of any size.

### 4. PageRank Algorithm
The PageRank Algorithm, initially developed by Google, is used to rank web pages in search results. It assigns a numerical weight to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, intending to measure its relative importance within the set.

## Experiments

### 1. Execution Time Benchmarking
This test measures the run-time performance of algorithms. Rapid execution times are crucial for time-sensitive applications.

### 2. Compression Ratio Measurement
This test evaluates the efficiency of a data compression algorithm by comparing the size of compressed data to the original data size.

### 3. Collision Resistance Test
This test determines the likelihood of two different inputs producing the same output in cryptographic hash functions, a crucial property for ensuring data integrity.

### 4. Memory Usage Profiling
Memory Usage Profiling assesses how efficiently an algorithm utilizes memory resources. Optimization here is key for memory-constrained environments.

### 5. Decompression Speed Test
This measures how quickly a compressed dataset can be successfully decompressed. Speed is often a trade-off with compression efficiency.

### 6. Disk I/O Measurement
This test evaluates algorithms based on their input/output operations with disk storage, crucial for applications dealing with massive datasets.
